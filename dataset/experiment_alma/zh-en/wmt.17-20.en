28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind spirit with a big heart.
His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.
He was the brother that went with the flow.
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.

Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.
The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended.
He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.
But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also turned since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He's denied that emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.
They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.
"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.
It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.
But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.
He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
I'm very emotional because my family are here as well
I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see.
He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.
It has been a rollercoaster ride.
Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.
Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.
And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.
Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but gave no reason.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian).
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.
Do the smiles convince?
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.
So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
No-one knows yet.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.
In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.
Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.
Mystery as fish land in Banff garden
A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
Happily, it all went very well.
Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Dynamic on vault.
Effortless on beam.
Jaw-dropping on floor.
Brilliant all over.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.
Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.
Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.
United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.
While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.
She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.
Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.
"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
Family tells the station he is expected to recover.
He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.
Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.
It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.
First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.
The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This is powerful.
Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.
To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government.
This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.
If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.
Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.
If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.
And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report
A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today.
Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote.
Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.
Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.
He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting.
Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.
Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.
He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.
And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.
'I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe besides the facial hair,' Brady told Huffington Post.
'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.
Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor
Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.
Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind the pair's similar looks
One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'
Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'.
Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'
Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf
CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.
We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.
That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'
'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'
Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.
To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'
She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'
Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.
'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.
'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.'
'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.'
All the product in question has been removed from sale.
How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.
Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.
If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.
Sounds tricky?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.
Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction
A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.
There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.
This family are notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.
Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished
Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past
Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.
One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'
We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.
The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.
The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
Treats says nude calendar for 'women, as well as men'
Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s' Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they're setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit pics online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Greenland shark is longest-living vertebrate animal - video report

French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.
They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."
The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.
"This 5,000-yuan subsidy solved the problem of my pressing need for money."
Zhou Fen, a girl who was registered in the poverty-stricken file of Mipo Village, Changle Town, Huayuan County, received the letter of admission from University of South China.
When she was worried about the tuition, the county committee of the Communist Youth League offered she a 5000-yuan subsidy on August 9.
Recently, the related county government department has provided a subsidy totaled 2.838 million yuan to over 690 poverty-stricken college students.
It also organized social fund-raising for students who are extremely poor in financial status to help them accomplish their study.
This year, Huayuan County integrated more than RMB 18.5 million of educational funds and self-raised more than RMB 2.5 million, which will be injected into the real-name bank accounts of the corresponding students.
"I thought my elder brother and I cannot afford the college study after my father passed away. It never occurred to me before the county government helped us so timely." She said gratefully.
As of August 8, Huayuan County had raised more than 21 million yuan of various relief funds this first half year for 13,140 poverty-stricken students.
All poverty-stricken students of the county that should be supported have been supported financially.
According to the reporter on the scene, a large container truck shifted to the fast lane with the command of a traffic policeman. Its container box fell down onto the green road, making a 2 cm deep pit on the road.
According to the Xinhua news agency, Australia's New South Wales government announced on the 11th day of the month that it will spend 200 million Australian dollars (about 154 million US dollars) to launch the biggest renovation on the famous Sydney Opera House since its establishment.
The New South Wales government said the renovation would not change the shell shape of the opera house.
The Sydney Opera House is one of Sydney's landmark buildings, designed by Danish architect Jorn Utzon and built in 1973. It welcomes about 8 million visitors each year.
Rory Jeffes, general manager of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes that the Sydney Opera House will make a "turnaround" via this renovation and become one of the world's concerts with the best sound effects.
Non-permanent residents who have lived in Beijing for more than six months and have a stable and legal employment or accommodation or conditions for continuous schooling in Beijing can apply for a residence permit.
Recently, the launch of implementation details of "Residence Permit Provisional Regulations" indicates that the "temporary residence permit" will be upgraded to "residence permit".
A responsible person of the relevant department said that the transition from the "temporary residence permit" to "residence permit" means that Beijing will shift its administration for non-permanent residents from the "management" to multi-directional services.
Today, a reporter learned from the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) that as of the end of June this year, the tax authorities at all levels have announced a total of 2,470 illegal "blacklist" cases.
It is understood that in July 2014, SAT took the first step in the central government departments to issue an Information Disclosure Methods For Major Tax Violations along with the Tax Credit Management Approach.
In addition to the illegal facts, legal basis, the handling and punishment of these cases, the basic information of the illegal parties and the relevant intermediaries will be included in the "blacklist" exposure.
Quality inspection, treasury, customs and other government departments also take relevant disciplinary measures against the "blacklist" parties.
"The credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and even the credit system of the whole society, which indicates that the construction of our social credit system is becoming more and more mature."
"Environmental problems are embodied by the atmosphere, water and soil pollution, but the root still lies in the mode of production and living."
For example, the land development ratio of Jiangsu Province was up to 21% in 2015, ranking top among all provinces and autonomous regions of China.
Therefore, the problem of high pollution, heavy energy consumption and land occupation has not been fundamentally addressed in the transformation of production and life styles.
On the one hand, Jiangsu tops in the whole country from the perspective of the establishment achievement of ecological environment of all levels and classes. But on the other hand, the resource and environment pressure is heavy.
To solidly promote the ecological environment protection and governance, we need to fundamentally promote the transformation of production and lifestyle and promote the transformation of people's livelihood from the perspective of ecological civilization construction.
On the 11th day of the month, 42 wind turbine blades produced by Guodian Group was prepared to be shipped and exported to South Africa from the wharf of Lianyungang Port.
Since last year, Guodian Group has exported a total of 163 sets of wind power projects from Lianyungang Port to South Africa.
The third party company (non-Chinese company) commissioned by the Olympic Organizing Committee is located in the Sao Paulo state, Brazil, about 75 kilometers away from the city of Sao Paulo.
To urge the manufacturers to finish the production ASAP, the Chinese Consulate General in Sao Paulo sent specially-assigned persons to the manufacturer for in-depth work.
After overtime work of 30 hours, the manufacturer finally completed the Chinese flag production and loaded for transportation. The task was finished 4-5 working days in advance.
It is reported that the flags are expected to arrive in Rio on the 11th. Then the Olympic Organizing Committee will send the flags to various Olympic venues after receiving the flag. The whole process will be under the supervision of the Chinese embassy in Brazil.
(This newspaper) On the 10th day of the month, the Nantong Municipal Government held a series of cooperation activities at the Shanghai International Convention Center. More than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate. More than 20 Hu-Tong industry docking projects worth at least RMB 100 million saw on-site signing.
The 20 projects with simultaneous signing have a total investment of RMB 8.063 billion, involving new energy, new materials, modern services and other industries.
Qingdao is China's 12th and also Shandong's first trial city to use and trade emissions.
On the 11th day of the month, many companies came to the Qingdao Municipal Emissions Trading Center to submit emissions subscription. After acceptance, they shall pay fees.
The upcoming first single transaction also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot officially kicked off. It will also be the first emissions trading in Shandong and the first city-level emissions trading in China.
In the morning of 11th day of the month, Zhao Xiuping, the General Manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical (Group) Co., Ltd. came to the trading center to submit emissions subscription.
Its plant in the old urban area of Qingdao came to a full halt and was moved to the new plant in Pingdu due to environmental reason.
After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form and the construction project environmental impact report, etc., Qingdao Municipal Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began to review the application materials.
According to the collection standard determined by Qingdao price bureau and financial sector, the estimated initial emission fee is about 641,200 yuan. The working staff will finish review within 7 working days.
The upcoming first single transaction also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot will officially kick off. It will also be the first emissions trading in Shandong and the first city-level emissions trading in China.
According to Zhao Xiuping, up to RMB 400 million has been invested in the current environmental protection. Such investment has a great impact on the enterprise management philosophy and social benefits and also opened up a space for the enterprise innovation management.
On the same day, Qingdao SF-XC-ZZ Coach Component Co., Ltd. also came to purchase emission rights for its project with an annual output of 4,200 interior accessories of high-speed rail and CRH.
The project is a mechanical processing enterprise. Its initial emission rate for the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia (NOX) are 0.514 tons/year and 0.052 tons/year, respectively.
The paid use and trading of Air Pollutant Emission Permits cover the city's key industrial enterprises for the production and supply of electricity and heat.
On January 1, 2016, the current pollutant discharging unit which obtained environmental impact assessment shall be exempt from expenditure of compensated use.
The obtaining of compensated emission right is not equal to the obtaining of illegal discharge, so companies cannot discharge pollutants at will.
Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau, introduces that companies of illegal and excessive sewage must be punished in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations. Illegal enterprises cannot be allowed to circumvent punishment via purchasing emission rights.
In other words, we need to crack down on environmental violations through legal means and severely punish the enterprises' over standard discharge behaviors, so as to protect the environment and public health.
Now for their own interests, enterprises have raised their enthusiasm of pollution control, cherished limited emissions and reduced emissions of pollutants.
With the economic interests drive, to reduce pollutants' discharge has shifted from the government's mandatory behavior into a conscious market behavior, so as to truly protect the environment, nature and public health.
Emission right, also known as "dumping right", means the right to discharge pollutants. It refers to the right for emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment in line with the law within the quota assigned by the government.
This right is essentially the right of the emitters to occupy, use and benefit from environmental capacity resources.
Next, under the premise that the total discharge of pollutants does not exceed the total allowable emission volume, the internal resources of pollution began to swap discharge capacities via currency exchange.
Since the proposition of emissions trading by American economist Dyers in 1968, it has been applied by the United States of America to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources since the 1970s.
Since its pilot in China in 2007, it has been applied to 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu.
According to the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in order to assist the air attack of the six strategic bombers on the "Islamic State" target in Syria, a number of Russian fighters lifted from the Syrian Mahmir Air Force base to provide support.
On February 22 this year, the United States and Russia reached a ceasefire agreement on the Syrian conflict. The ceasefire agreement will be implemented since February 27.
Under the agreement, the ceasefire does not include a military strike against terrorist organizations including "Islamic State" and "Salvation Front ", which were identified by the United Nation Security Council.
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure in the base and the living conditions of the Russian soldiers will be protected correspondingly.
He also said that if the extremist forces were not hit, these forces will be extended to Russia.
Although Russia and the West did not reach an agreement on the cooperation against the extremist forces of Syria, Russia would strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran and Iraq in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia, at the invitation of the Syrian government, began a military strike against Syrian extremist forces.
On March 15 this year, Russia's major military forces began to evacuate, but the Russian side promised to continue to retain the military base in Heimi Mimi and the naval base in Tartus.
In the case of renovating old houses and successful startup in his hometown, He Peijun is making a good example: to inherit a 100-year old house and tell a story about the land heritage.
Today, 100,000 people on average visit Zhushan each year, bringing a variety of ideas or seeking inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between the village and the city should companionship with, just like mother and child. No matter strong or weak. There is no need for any party to be governed by the other party. Such a relationship is warm.
There is no fixed pattern of rural development, but it is quite difficult to just rely on spontaneous rural changes. One of the most important changes is to let the right people go to villages.
Shanghai Songjiang District Traffic Control Department recently used electronic police to monitor whether the driver plays mobile phone while driving. As a result, more than 30 cases were detected in a week.
With the popularity of smart phones, mobile phones become more and more funny. WeChat, microblogging and even games, shopping on Taobao have become normal. It seems that many people cannot leave the phone for a moment, and cannot stop even when driving.
According to "Road Traffic Safety Act", mobile phones playing are banned and defined as "behavior preventing safe driving".
Unfortunately, due to some reasons such as the large number of illegal cases and difficulty in obtaining evidences, those people have never been punished and make the laws become a kind of decoration.
If the traffic control department can be determined to declare war to the mobile phone playing behavior while driving and normalize such measures, such illegal behaviors will surely be curbed.
The public security organ shall be strict with household registration management by gradually establishing electronic and paper files for people without Hukou (household registration) and ensure the completeness and validity.
The public security organ shall promptly notify the relevant departments of the registration of people without Hukou.
The policy measures that are inconsistent with the idea of this implementation will receive a centralized cleanup. They should be corrected and abolished if necessary.
In the collective greenhouse of Donglin village of Taicang City, the 48-year-old Wang Xuefen is leading workers to pear spray pesticides on pear trees.
There are 150 acres of orchards and more than 10 species, but only 12 workers plus a technical engineer are ok.
Last year, the income was a total of RMB 50,000. I cannot earn so many if i work in the factory because of such age.
Last year, the income of Donglin village reached RMB 22 million, of which total agricultural income accounted for nearly a half.
According to Su Qifang, the village secretary, per capita land cultivation area increases each year. 50 mu (a unit of area, one "mu"=0.0667 hectares) in the beginning and over 100 mu now. The revenue per mu increases every year and the income of professional farmers also have room for growth every year.
With shares quantifying to each villager, the highlight of the rural collective economic reform is to be clear about the property rights of rural collective management and exploring political and economic separation.
In July 2015, on Anzhen Street of Wuxi Xishan District, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations worked with the village committee to implement "sub-account management". The village committee implemented rural public affairs management while the cooperative organizations were mainly engaged in business.
With two accounts for two institutions, this can prevent the village cadres from participating in collective asset management corruption.
Zhu Baoping, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Agriculture Committee, said that the next step of Jiangsu government is to continue to promote the reform of community cooperation system, encourage farmers to jointly develop and establish a village-level democratic power operation mechanism.
According to Zhu Baoping, they should further move forward the reform, engage in community shares cooperation, quantify the assets to members, fix it to farmers and produce clear property rights.
Through the Internet +, we shall provide farmers with the rights to know, participate in decision-making and democratic management and turn such rights into standardized mechanism of cooperation.
At present, the new collective economy in southern Jiangsu village mainly consists of four development modes, including asset leasing, enterprise stock, agricultural development and joint development.
It is understood that overseas exhibitions have become important platform for the "Belt and Road Initiative" development.
The success of these overseas exhibitions has accumulated valuable experience and laid a good foundation for the continuous exploration of emerging markets along the "Belt and Road Initiative" road and building overseas exhibition integrated platform.
PEAK will always be oriented to promoting consumer demand, building sports industry ecosphere and accelerating the strategic upgrading of single sporting goods manufacturing enterprise to professional sports service enterprises.
Hamir also said that another 34 people were injured. Among them, three firefighters suffered from minor injuries and were discharged.
As some of the tenants were still missing, he also called on residents of the fireplaces to contact the authorities.
It is reported that, Ms. Du Lei (Mariana Turay) who has been living in this apartment for 30 years, said: "It seems like a bomb falling down."
It is reported that the local fire brigade spent an hour and 45 minutes to put out the fire and residents of the nearby buildings were allowed to return in a few hours.
American Red Cross staff estimated that about 100 people were homeless, 60 to 70 among which were mostly hispanic and stayed in the shelters nearby.
On August 11, the first Jinzhou Wetland Tourism Festival kicked off at Jinzhou Qriental Huadicheng "Crane Lake".
From 2014 onwards, the revenue of tourism industry accounted for 10% of the GDP of Jinzhou and reached 11.3% in 2015.
The Qriental Huadicheng Wetland Hot Spring tourist area is located at No.1, Linghai section, Binhai Highway, Dayou Economic Development Zone, Jinzhou City. It is 50 km away from Linghai downtown area and 70 km from Panjin City.

Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: "handsome hands" encourage her to start shooting career, which saw several "reverse"
Zhang Donghong, a villager of the East Park Village, Xiamen Xiang'an District, changed his 29-inch old TV into a 65-inch TV just a few days before.
The ordinary farmer has a daughter, named Zhang Binbin. She is the one to win sanzi final silver medal of Olympic Games Women's 50-meters rifle games for China in the evening of the eleventh.
In the evening of the 11th day of the month, just in front of this new TV set, the Zhang Donghong couple and their dozens of relatives and friends have witnessed the magic process for the couple's daughter to catch up and reverse from almost being eliminated in the preliminaries to almost winning.
At the game, Zhang Binbin was ranked in the middle and lower reaches and it seemed she was still quite far away from the final.
But her parents and friends did not give up, kept watching the live and saw other players finish the game. Zhang Binbin raised her ranks all the way and finally came to the final. At this time, a burst of cheers broke out in her home.
In the final, Zhang Binbin also started from lagging behind and shot more stably and won the silver medal with just 0.2 rings behind the champion.
This year, the 27-year-old Zhang Binbin, in the 16-year shooting career, has actually missed the silver medal for several times.
According to her mother Zhang Xiaolong, her daughter sent a few "little persuaders" from her village at their hesitation.
These little persuaders are girls and boys of her village who were recommended to attend the training at the same time, including Zhang Binbin's cousin.
Just after coming to Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again took the initiative to return to Xiang'an school because of her family difficulties.
But after the repeated efforts of her enlightening teacher, Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen team.
And after she came into the provincial team, Zhang Binbin returned home because she found it almost hopeless to enter the national team after a long time.
This time, not only the coach Zhang Yajie, but also the leaders and coach of Xiamen shooting archery sports center and Fujian provincial team came to her home. With their efforts, Zhang Binbin was finally persuaded to return to the provincial team.
Just at yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl achieved several reversals of the shooting with her insistence.
"Each coach has his own method to choose the potential player. I decided to take her once I saw her beautiful hands."
Zhang Donghong also recalled, in the training test, although the results of her daughter were not the best, her rings were very stable, which is also an important reason for Zhang Binbin to attract coaches.
During the training process of Zhang Binbin, it was the input of this farmer girl that impressed Zhang Yajie most.
He recalled that after Zhang Binbin came into the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, the team carried out a long shot of gun training, requiring players not to move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well-behaved child, with the hobby of painting and producing toys.
"I used to make clothes and do some sowing jobs. Binbin picked up some scraps to make her own dolls."
She said, her daughter often sewed hand toys. Plus, she is good at painting and could make animated toys from the doll's facial features to clothing.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and her family are separate more than being together. As she can only return home during festivities, she mainly contacts family members by phone in other time.
According to her parents, no matter meeting in person or talking by phone, Zhang Binbin seldom talked about her hard work but more about some happy things.
Because they cannot often see their daughter, they put away the paintings of her childhood and honors of consecutive years.
Zhang Xiaolong showed the animation show of her daughter to the reporter, "She should keep drawing instead if she did not become shooter."
In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin, there was a cupboard filled with medals and certificates.
Zhang Donghong put away the medals neatly and placed all certificates into files for storage. "This is honor made by Binbin after a dozen of years' efforts. We feel quite cherished."
Recently, Hebei Cixiao Fund sent a 16,000-yuan relief sent to six families who lost their relatives in Xiaozuo, Taitou and Guiquan Village of Jinjing County.
This is another condolence and care activity after the fund association releases the call for finding "bereaved children and lonely old men causued by the flood disaster in July 19, 2016".
The 719 heavy rainfall caused heavy disaster to many cities of Hebei Province and resulted in the flood disaster of some regions in Hebei province. During the period, some people were dead and missing.
The good man "Lao Tie" sacrificed his life when he helped the community on drainage, leaving a 2-year-old kid and a wife with child. The moving story of the good man "Lao Tie" made the entire provincial capital moved.
On August 4, the working personnel of Hebei Provincial Cixiao Fund and volunteers of Hebei Brand Association came to his home and offered his relatives with 3,200-yuan love donation.
When Ye Li, the vice president of Hebei Brand Association acknowledged the situation of "Lao Tie", they immediately decided to carry out "love charity" activities among enterprise members to help "old iron" family to ride out the storm.
Hebei Provincial Cixiao Fund, known as Cixiao Fund of the Hebei Volunteer Service Foundation, was initiated by the Hebei Brand Preparatory Committee, and established in August 2015.
According to a Hong Kong Oriental Daily report made on August 12, the current diamond sales in Mainland China were accused of three major problems, including the false marking of diamond clarity to raise sales price, false diamond weight and unguaranteed aftersales, etc.
Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers. The diamond cutting technology of local artisans is well-known. All diamonds on sale have undergone rigorous identification, deeply welcomed by the mainland ladies.
"A small cloth bag, holding in one's hand, such light-weighted, is worth of almost one million yuan", a woman surnamed Liu who participated in the purchase of diamonds told of her experience in Antwerp last June to the mainland media.
She buried the diamond in her lingerie and carried it all day along, including when she went to toilet and took bath.
She said the diamond she bought in Antwerp was priced about RMB 55,000 per gram and diamond of the same quality was retail-priced about RMB 111,000 in Xia'men.
Recently, she sold the diamond with 120% more than the price she bought and earned two hundred thousand yuan.
According to the provisions of the Mainland Customs, diamonds are neither supplies nor necessities during the trip and thus belong to the scope of goods. So such diamond should be declared at entry and exit. Otherwise, it shall be classified as smuggling. People may be sentenced to jail.
According to foreign media reports, on the 10th day of the month of the local time, the British Prime Minister's Downing Street announced that British Prime Minister Teresa Mei will go to Switzerland to spend the summer vacation, but did not disclose the specific place.
According to some media, after the British referendum off Europe, the new British Prime Minister chose to spend her vacation on the "neutral country", Swiss on the European continent. This is symbolic.
The British "Guardian" commented that the symbolic neutrality nature of the Swiss played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister's first resort.
British "Daily Telegraph" commented that Teresa Mei chose to take a vacation in Switzerland. This is the first time that the British Prime Minister chose to go vacation in Swiss after Margaret Thatcher.
The choice of these two female prime ministers is quite a contrast to the hot place which Blair and Cameron, the two male prime ministers like to go to.
It is reported that the new British Prime Minister Teresa Mei will return to London on August 24. A series of important work and activities will be waiting for her.
The British parliament will resume on September 5. The subject matter covers the second Brexit referendum required by the internet.
On June 23, the British held a referendum for Brexit, but the British new prime minister did not want to start the article 50, which is involved with the Lisbon Treaty before the end of the year.
There are 1,325 existing intangible cultural heritage projects in Huangshan. Its number and quantity ranked first in Anhui province.
As the inheritance of intangible cultural heritage projects of Anhui province mainly relies on oral and face-to-face passage, many intangible cultural heritage projects are on the verge of failing to be handed down from past generations. So the application of digital technology for conservation is imperative.
According to the work plan of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress this year, the Standing Committee plans to listen to the deliberation of special work report, and carry out the implementation of banking supervision and management law and special inquiry of serving local economic development.
In mid-August, the Standing Committee will organize two research groups to conduct research in some cities to prepare for the special inquiry.
Hua Jianhui pointed out that this was the first time that the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress listened to and deliberated on the special work report of vertical administration department and carry out special inquiries. It is the active exploration for enhancing and exploring the supervision work of the Provincial People's Congress.
In the director department of Kashi, Xinjiang, with the order of the director, the armed police in three regions, namely Kashi, Hotan and Aksu, followed the order quickly, implemented motor-driven and left for the exercise combat zone.
China's Mars program is coming
China Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling at one time, which has never occurred in foreign countries.
China's Mars exploration launch target is to step around, land and patrol at one time. Such task has considerable difficulty.
Because the Mars probe can encounter a time window in 26 months, experts are closely working on the project plan and try to launch the first Mars probe in 2020.
According to Xu Dazhe, although China's aircraft has entered a deep space, it is still essential to finish the task of Mars exploration. The detection of Mars means that China has stepped into the deep space exploration era in a true sense.
"Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most energy efficient to launch the vehicle."
"Taking into account the mass of Mars detectors, it will be the job of China's Long March 5 carrier rocket to complete the launch mission."
China's Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling at one time, which has never occurred in foreign countries. There was one time of surrounding and landing before in foreign countries, but the landing failed.
Mars exploration involves a lot of technical areas. In particular, although the rover is a space detector, it has a distinctive feature compared with the general space detector.
In other words, the Mars probe should be capable of determining the driving route and equipped with the ability to find obstacles.
According to Pang Zhihao, a researcher of the fifth institute of China's Aerospace Science and Technology Group, the reason for human being to favor Mars exploration is because Mars detection has significant scientific and technical meanings and it even matters to the future of human beings.
Currently, the Mars has become the planet with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration.
Therefore, the human beings hope that one day on the Mars to establish a base of residence, and ultimately to Mars immigration, it turned into a second home of mankind.
A large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth, only after billions of years of evolution into the atmosphere thin, low temperature, water depletion and so on.
Therefore, the detection or manned landing on the Mars for research can help propose a pre-arranged planning to prevent the earth from becoming the second Mars which is difficult for human beings to inhabit.
As of June 2016, the world conducted a total of 114 lunar explorations, including 43 Mars detection missions.
However, ever since the 1990s, a total of 18 human explorations have been carried out and only 14 lunar detections have been conducted.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rovers at work, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are at work.
World space powers have developed a detection plan with the Mars system as target. So we can see the current Mars detection is hotter than that of moon detection.
On Nov. 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars probe "Mangalian", and has become Asia's first country for successful detection of the Mars.
"Mangalian" is used to study the surface, the atmosphere and mineral characteristics of the Mars and explore whether there are signs of methane and life on the Mars.
The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the Martian atmosphere for aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration.
According to Sun Zezhou, the chief designer of a Mars detector of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Mars exploration task is confronted with many technical challenges.
The atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low, only 1% of the Earth's surface atmospheric pressure, with high uncertainty.
Scientists have not had a thorough understanding of Mars factors such as its changes and storm characteristics.
A dust storm similar to the Earth's dust is often formed in the Mars in the summer, which will lead to a sharp decline in solar energy. So a "sleep" mode must be designed for the Mars rover and let it wait patiently until the disappearance of dust storms.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the energy supply for Mars detection.
This requires that the detector's sun wing area to be larger, and need to constantly adjust, and strive to align with the sun direction.
In addition, since the gravity of the Mars is only 38% of that of the earth and much higher than that of the Moon surface, so the probe requires higher power.
"The core and the most difficult part of the Mars exploration mission are the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration process after the probe enters Martian atmosphere. There is just one chance to ensure success."
According to Sun Ze, it must rely on the detector to complete the entire process because the distance between the Earth and the Mars is quite large.
Because there is not so much propellant to offset the high speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth.
Pang Zhihao said, in general, the way to detect the Mars is similar to the way to detect the moon. The entire process is also "surrounding, landing, patrolling and returning" to achieve the goal of manned landing on the Mars.
Because the distance between the Mars and the earth is larger than that between the Moon and Earth, it needs to overcome a series of more complex technical difficulties before the Mars detection.
According to Taiwanese media reports, Lin Quan, the head of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, announced yesterday morning, "Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations by political parties and their accompanying organizations" will take effective since today.
KMT Vice Chairman Zhan Qixian said, "Kuomintang, with a hundred years of history, will step down otherwise without social commitment and responsibility."
Lin Quan stressed that if the political party, accompanying organization or trustees are in violations of the regulations which prohibit provisions ban, the Commission will investigate and punish "according to the law".
Lin Quan also announced that Hong Peigen, "Deputy Director of the Independent", will serve as the vice chairman of the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee.
He said that Gu Lixiong will be the most appropriate candidate for the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations. The experience of Hong Peigen who dealt with the major cases will serve as the foundation for the committee to uncover the related Ill-gotten Party Assets.
Zhan Qixian said that, as long as there are party assets today, no one will give you social donations. So if the party were all confiscated away, then Kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship, "You will have chance to go when there are no assets."
Zhan Qixian also stressed that even if the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations goes into effect and the Kuomintang party assets are not fully confiscated, the rest will continue to be confiscated as promised, the party asset will go null and the party will start from scratch.
Original title: Suit launched by "corridor doctor" Lan Yuefeng against CCTV host Wang Zhi'an for reputation infringement fails in instance judgment
The legal evening news: Because the CCTV host Wang Zhi'an published his remarks against the "corridor doctor" event on microblogging, Lan Yuefeng brought Wang Zhi'an and Beijing Micro Dream Chuangke Network Technology Co., Ltd. to the court.
Yesterday afternoon, Haidian court sentenced the case and the verdict said that Wang Zhi'an and Micro Dream Company did not constitute the infringement and dismissed the Lan Yuefeng for all the claims.
At the beginning of 2014, CCTV reporter Wang Zhi'an found after his survey that although Lan Yuefeng was sitting in the corridor for more than 600 days and was shaped as the tragic hero suppressed by the media, these reports had a lot of false information.
On March 29, 2014, the "corridor doctor" program produced by CCTV news survey broadcasted.
All information about the so-called over-medical treatment reported by Lan Yuefeng to the media do not have any evidence support.
In the microblogging with real-name certification, Wang Zhi'an also said that the reason for Lan Yuefeng to become this is because of his stubborn characters and paranoid personality".
Lan Yuefeng claimed that Wang Zhi'an should delete the microblogging and apologized to him and made compensation of 100,000 yuan for the mental damage solatium.
At the time of the trial, the two sides argued whether Wang Zhian violated the reputation right of Lan Yuefeng.
Highlight of the 12th day of the month: at the beginning of Track and Field Events, the Chinese team is quite busy and the women's football association aims to become the top four of the bicycle games
The bicycle game is expected to realize the "zero breakthrough" in the Olympic gold medal while the Women's World Cup girls will challenge Germany team, the world champion winner for twice and are expected to become the top four.
Wang Zhen was quite outstanding in the two races. He won silver medal for the athletics world championship held in Beijing last year and was upgraded to the individual project champion in the world championship this May.
According to foreign media reports, Zhang Huizhen, the 27-year-old Korean archery female player won the gold medal in the women's archery individual tournament. This is the second scoring of Olympic gold medal following the team competition. This made she become a double winner.
Zhang Huizhen is considered as a late bloomer. She regrets about not winning the last session of the London Olympic Games tickets before, but now she proudly stands on the top of the Rio Olympic podium.
Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in Lisa Wenglu, a total score of 6-2 in the women's archery finals at the Samba Boulevard in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
She did archery for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school. She won the first individual tournament gold medal when she was 27 in 2014. So she is a late bloomer.
Zhang Huizhen recalled, "My performance before high school was too bad to enable me to participate in the national competition.
Zhang Huizhen was ranked the fourth at the London Olympic Games qualification trials. Unfortunately, she lost the Olympic admission and can just watch her colleague and good friend Qi Pubei score two gold medals.
Zhang Huizhen talked about his gold winning after the women's individual awards ceremony of archery. "I tried to shoot one by one until the last. Maybe it is because this brings me good results and makes me contented."
The 28-year-old Korean archery "No.1", and the London Olympic Games archery individual tournament winner Qi Fubei won the bronze medal.
Qi Fubei was defeated by Zhang Huizhen in the semifinals and competed for the bronze medal with the Mexican player Alexandra Valencia.
Qi Fubei shed tears after she knew she won the blonde medal. At this time, we can know her pressure.
Firstly, the coaching staff accumulated rich experience in his gradual study. Secondly, it needs scientific training, which should be accumulated over time.
The Archery team helped the team players focus and remain unbiased via military training and going through the cemetery during night.
Although not yet confirmed, it is said by many sources that Apple's 2016 autumn conference will be held in September, and iPhone7 would really be launched into the market.
Although Apple did not respond, there are news release about the function and configuration of the new iPhone. There are even the images of iPhone7 "real machine model" on the internet.
The new generation of iPhone is really "eye-catching", hot and hard-to-get. If you want to buy the genuine product at the first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning.
This has exacerbated people's disappointment of the new iPhone, "It is lengthened, but cannot be used to cast holographic images! This generation of iPhone is so terrible."
iPhone7, just like other iPhones, brings countless secret before birth.
In addition, there are a number of sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will have the 3.5mm headphone jack cancelled, and adopt Bluetooth connection and charging interface instead, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker.
Another evidence to support this news is that as early as 2014, Apple will allow headset manufacturers to produce headset products via producing charging interface.
Another evidence to confirm this message is that Apple allows the headphone manufacturer to produce headphone via the connection of charge interface.
Whether these news are true or false will not be unveiled until the 2016 Apple autumn conference.
But this does not prevent the industry insiders to be optimistic about the prospects of iPhone7 - many people think that iPhone7 will be likely to become the last major upgrade of Apple's iPhone series, although it can be seen from the data released by the market research institution IDC that the market share of iPhone will decline to some degree.
Among them, Goldman Sachs ranked Apple's stock to be the rating of "buying" while BMO analyst thought that iPhone7 will obtain a historical high sales achievement.
Meanwhile, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue growth will likely be more than 20%, which is entirely due to the introduction of iPhone7.
7% of respondents said they have the plan to buy iPhone7, while only 4% people had the plan to buy iPhone6.
It is understood that currently 20% of user groups of iPhone6 or 6Plus have such a plan to purchase iPhone7. This is a quite high proportion.
Secondly, according to expert analysis, most of the iPhone fans like to replace their own iPhone mobile phone.
According to statistics, among all iPhone users, about 26% of users have not changed their phones for 2 years. That is, almost 120 million users of iPhones have been using the same iPhone for 2 years.
According to media, Taiwan witnessed several earthquakes during the production period of iPhone7. "The destruction of TSMC production facilities is beyond imagination and may impact the initial supply of iPhone7."
Supply and demand contradiction will affect the average user, so it is time to choose a good channel and purchase the genuine iPhone7 for the first time.
According to informed sources, recently, Suning executives and Apple frequently meet, with the purpose to prepare adequate supply.
Operators have negotiated with Suning. So it is foreseeable that, with the depth of cooperation between the two sides, lower prices and more intimate services will inevitably bring to users.
"With the lowest price, the consumer may "buy iPhone7 with just 7 yuan per day".
Adequate supply and a variety of concessions will alleviate the pressure of iPhone7 buying. Suning's logistics will change such good feeling into more intuitive sense of experience.
Maybe you'll get a call at midnight. "Hello, Suning Tesco, your iPhone7 is here."
The organizers hope that the local people can understand more about the history of Chinese culture via the cultural relics exhibition, thereby enhancing the mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
As part of the European tour, Barcelona's "Ming Dynasty Heritage Exhibition" will continue until early October.
Yesterday, Huaxia Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank issued a semi-annual report of the year 2016. In the second quarter, China Securities Finance Corporation Limited (CSFC) will once again buy their shares.

According to the estimates of China Merchants Securities, deducted from the shares, CSFC will hold another 38 million shares of Pudong Development Bank in the second quarter and raise its shares to almost 600 million shares, which account for 2.77% of the bank shares.
Recently, Shizi Bang Hebo Park, Zhengfu village, Tongxiang City, Zhejiang province will be open to villagers and tourists formally.
Composed of more than 100 circular small ponds, the park is planted with more than 300 varieties of ornamental lotus, water lilies and so on.
Rural lotus industry is both ornamental and amusing, with economic benefits and has become the highlights for the development of new villages.
According to foreign media reports, the "green pool" incident of Rio Olympic Games gained much attention because its diving pool water was changed from blue to green.
However, on the morning of the 10th day of the month, the water of the match pool adjacent to the water pool also turned green.
Australian water polo contestant said that his eyes feel tingling and would like to shed tears.
Previously, Rio officials confirmed the situation of water greening, and said the water color is due to the weakening of alkaline reasons and will not affect the athlete's health.
However, after Australian players achieved success with the Japanese delegation in the water polo pool, they said their eyes felt pricking.
When the water of diving pool turned green, the hosting party worked overtime to deal with the diving pool problems in the evening of the 9th day of the month and found the rapid change of water polo pool in the morning of the 10th day of the month.
During the competition period of the Australia and Japanese team, the environmental conditions of the water polo pond gradually worsened, but the official stressed that they would manage to return the water quality of the two pools to their original colors on the 11th day of the month.
Mario Andrada, the spokesman of Rio Olympic Games said, "The alkalinity of water quality in the diving pool firstly turned weak after the yesterday afternoon".
"We learned about a series of causes that could cause discoloration of water and result in the alkalinity of water quality."
The water sports center conducted a series of tests on water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the swimming pool to determine whether the water quality meets criteria. "
"We have been following the normal procedure these days, but we may have overlooked the impact of more athletes on water quality."
"But the change in water color certainly has no effect on health, especially for athletes."
"This independent team confirms our assessment and confirms the measures we have taken to restore the normal color and normal chemical status of the pool."
"We had hoped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain."
According to Taiwan's "The Central News Agency", one jail in the suburb of the Manila area saw a bombing event, resulting in the death of 10 prisoners, including two Chinese, and the injury of the warden.
According to the ABS-CBN television, the event occurred at Paranaque prison around 9 o'clock last night, but the police did not make a preliminary statement until 2 am today.
The police said that 10 prisoners asked to see the warden and complained about the transfer of prison matters, but the two sides mistime their marks. A prisoner threw grenades and caused an explosion.
The jail has not yet announced the names of the dead prisoners, but according to the GMA television station, there were two Chinese.
As of 8 a.m., the prison authorities have not yet made a detailed statement, including how the prisoners get grenades.
Yesterday, the central Philippine police entered the prison of Leyte area, killing a torturer who "attempted assaulting the police".
Urumqi normalizes the operating order of travel tourism market and regulates that travel agencies must sign contracts with tourists
Currently, Xinjiang has entered peak tourist season. In order to regulate the management order of tourism FIT market, yesterday Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment worked with the law enforcement detachment of Urumqi Transportation Authority to investigate and deal with the non-normative travel vehicles existent in the tourism FIT market, and the low contract signing between the travel agency and tourists.
At 8 O'clock of yesterday morning, around 10 buses packed with tourists parked around the Kempinski Hotel. These vehicles are mostly individual group that went for Tianchi One Day Tour.
"Hello, I am from the Urumqi City Tourism Bureau. Did you sign with the travel agency?"
Yu Bin, the working staff of law enforcement detachment of Urumqi Transportation Authority explained, "The foreign tourist bus and bus line worked on tourist transport project in Urumqi market, but they did not have qualification."
"A fine of 30,000 to 100,000 yuan will be imposed for operation beyond scope. The driver who did not have a qualification certificate will pay RMB 2,000 for fine."
It is reported that the Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Department has investigated the places including West Park and Hongshan where the independent travelers are centralized.
After integrating the inspection twice, Ma Qi, the deputy head of Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment said that, "Safety first, norm second. No small matters for the travel vehicles. And people will be injured and killed in groups in case of any questions."
"The management and we have made continuous inspection on the market to normalize the car use behavior of tourist agency to ensure the safety of tourists."
On the morning of August 12, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.
Sheng Yunyun, spokesman of National Bureau of Statistics and head of National Economic Statistics Division said that, in July, the part index number of national economy slowed relatively but still operated in the reasonable range.
According to the data of National Bureau of Statistics, the fixed asset investment growth, total imports and other data in July have come down.
Sheng Laiyun said, as for the national economy in July, I would like to use the words of Premier, "the shape is volatile and the potential is still good". This is a better way to summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July.
He explained that "the shape of the fluctuations" refers to the fall after rise of some economic indicators growth rate in July.
In July, the domestic and international economy is still in the deep adjustment, the international situation is complex and volatile and the world economic recovery is less than expected, so the export pressure is still relatively heavy.
As for the domestic situation, the whole economy is still in the critical stage of adjustment, adjustment labor pains are releasing and the economy is under great pressure, so some indicators are still fluctuating.
Sheng Laiyun pointed out that there was a special case in July, with serious floods, high temperature and hot weather which have brought some impact on production and operation of some areas.
According to the recent report of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people were affected, with direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan.
From the view of industrial, investment and transport-related indicators, these areas are affected to varying degrees.
The cargo turnover growth rate in July fell back 3.6 percentage and floods on these areas have a certain impact on traffic.
From these factors, it is quite normal to have some fluctuations in some indicators. And such thing is expected.
He said, "The potential is still good" means that despite the fallback of economic growth, the overall economic performance is stable and steady. And the good momentum has not changed.
In July, CPI rose by 1.8%, with a month-on-month rise of 0.2%. From January to July, CPI rose by 2.1%, so the overall price situation is stable.
According to the statistics of hot weather in the districts and counties by the portal of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Meteorology, in addition to Youyang, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance.
At present, at least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the standard of the allowance, but the standards issued by provinces and municipalities are not the same, and people in Chongqing receive the allowance based on the count of high-temperature working days.
In case of temperature between 35 and 37 ℃, people can receive allowance of no less than 10 yuan per day. In case of temperature above 37℃, people are released with the allowance of not less than 15 yuan.
In case of temperature above 40℃, staff working in high temperature can receive up to 20 yuan per day of allowance (but for laborers who enjoy the high temperature job allowance).
In accordance with this standard, people in Kaizhou which has the highest number of high temperature can receive 330 yuan. And people in Chengkou with the least days of high temperature can receive 80 yuan. And the maximum temperature of Youyang did not meet the high temperature standards, so there is no high temperature allowance.
In the past, many companies adopt cool drinks as high temperature allowance. The city safety supervision bureau deemed that this behavior does not meet the current regulation.
Employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of workers in case of terminating work and reducing working hours in high temperature weather.
The city's Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said that if employees did not receive high temperature allowance while working under high temperature, they may fight for the legitimate rights and interests via the labor dispute mediation organization or dial 12333 for complaint.
If the employing unit refuses to pay the high temperature allowance, the laborer may lodge a complaint with the competent department of human resources social security at the county level or above.
At the same time, because the high temperature allowance is part of the wage and not welfare, such allowance shall be included in the total wages, with tax deducted.
So the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage, it must be issued in cash and not substituted by physical objects such as drinks.

Urumqi new passenger station, after its official launching into operation, will become an important platform to build the national integrated transport city and promote the construction of "Silk Road Economic Zone" and the new district.
Gracia is a cute female toucan, exuding the breath of tropical rain forest.
In Costa Rica, one of the Central American countries, Toucan Gracia and its story have long been known.
At the press conference on August 10, after postoperative rehabilitation, Gresham finally appeared and showed people its brand new 3D printing plastic beak.
This toucan, which had its beak broken and was dying just one year and a half ago, finally regained its new life.
This day not only announced that it has restored health by 100%, but also signaled its moving into the luxury aviary to meet its human friends.
The newcomer Grecia was slightly shy initially, but soon became lively, rolling in the basin frolic and eating grapes with a new beak.
In order to remind people that it has suffered damage, the technical staff did not give it a new beak color, but to retain the original white color of the 3D print material.
The beak is a thin layer of horny sheath, which is hollow inside and only has some of the thin bone to support.
Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt.
Animal rescue center, ornithologist and a US 3D printing company worked together to prepare several "test beak" for Gracia and finally built a "perfect beak" for it.
Now Gracia has been able to use the new beak to drink water, eat, and even peck fine grains.
"The design of the finished product costs about two months and it just takes 4-5 hours to print it."
"3D printing is not the future technology but really enters into your life." Thomas Lange, the chairman of US SG3D printing company said in an interview with Xinhua International.
In January 2015, Gracia, lying on a farm in the town of Alajuela in the middle of Costa Rica, was found with blood covering on its body.
At that time, its beak was cruelly broken by a group of young people. It was completely unable to eat and dying.
After the tragedy of the Gracia was reported by the media, there are a tide of animal anti-abuse call occurring inside and outside Costa Rica.
People demand to establish more rigorous animal protection law to enhance the punishment against abusers.
People came spontaneously to try their utmost to help Gracia restore its life before hurting.
Even the inventor of the 3D printing technology, Chuck Hull, is also involved in the design of the Gracia beak.
"The situation of Gracia is very special, and its remaining part of the beak is less than 1 centimeter, so there are many difficulties in installing the new beak."
"We first scanned Gracia and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis slightly longer than the rest of its beak and fixed on its beak with glue."
"This can reduce the risk of further intrusive damage to Gracia," Lange told Xinhua International.
Before installing the prosthesis, the staff cleared the broken beak of Gracia every day to prevent infection.
Thousands of miles away, the story of the Toucan Gracia touched the famous documentary director Paula El Reidia and the news channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded a little bit of the process of installing a new beak, and recorded a documentary "The Country of Toucan", which was played this month on the Animal Planet Channel.
The documentary "The State of the Toucan" shows people how a small Toucan has changed a country and how people get involved in the fight against torture of animals.
Core Tip: Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of Chinese oil companies, especially known as the "teapot" of China's small independent refinery.
August 12 report on Cankaoxiaoxi website: Japan's largest oil company JX Energy believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the market downturn."
Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of Chinese oil companies, especially known as the "teapot" of China's small independent refinery.
China's oil products are gradually close to Japan's oil products because the Chinese government has strengthened environmental protection regulations.
Before obtaining the import license for crude oil, "teapot refinery" generally refines oil from the heavy oil, which has high sulfur content and is imported from Russia.
The petroleum products are poor in quality due to high sulfur content and become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining crude oil import license, "teapot refinery" can import Oman crude oil and Russian crude oil, which have low sulfur content and improved petroleum products.
East Fuel General Oil Company said, "With China's domestic oil product quality standards continuing to improve, the refining capacity of the equipment also increased.
As a result, the quality of oil products exported from China gradually rivalled that of Japan (the world's highest quality).
According to JX Energy, "After the end of 2015, China began to export high-quality light oil to Australia." Such light oil products are competitive with Japanese products on the Asian market.
Although the "Japanese high quality oil" falls into a crisis, the Japanese oil companies just adopted the strategy of "exporting to profitable areas while being concerned about the market".
As China's exports of petroleum products have a huge impact on the Asian market, teapot refinery got more attentions.

A mid-aged man in India last week experienced airplane belly landing shock at Dubai International Airport. He won US$1 million award in the same airport last week.
Muhammad Bashir Abdul Hedar, who long lives in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, has a habit of buying lottery tickets every time he returns.
His 21-year-old son suffered from paralysis due to accidental fall 13 days after his birth. He has toiled day in day out to repay his son's medical expenses loan.

Although now it is the beginning of autumn, the power of "afterheat" seems not to be weaker at all than that in the summer.
UV not only tans your skin but also sunburns it, so how to make the skin go through the military training, without sunburn?
Sunblock is generally marked with SPF and PA on the package. SPF refers to Sun Protection Function and is targeted at UVB. The common SPF index includes 15, 30, 50, etc.
The product marked with PA is for UVA, so that sunblock will play a more effective role. Usually, the intensity of PA is represented with +. An extra + indicates extension of effective protection time.
Water-based sunblock with a strong penetration is often applied to oily skin. Sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
Creamy sunscreen is often applied to dry skin. The classification of neutral skin generally has no strict rules. Any kind of skin care products are burden to the sensitive skin. So it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.
Remember to apply sunblock half an hour in advance, because sunscreen products take time to completely penetrate into the skin.
Because you are exposed to sun longer during the military training, you have to apply the sunscreen products once every two hours to lengthen the effect. So keep doing it.
As the skin has just been stimulated by the sun's sake, do not immediately use whitening products after returning from military training.
After exposure under the blazing sun for quite a long time, please wrap the ice with towel to ease the sunburned skin and alleviate the local heat if condition allowed.
The cumulative subsidy policy will be remain available for buying agricultural machinery during the exhibition and farmers can get agricultural subsidies of up to 40%.

"Hunan Exposition" has become an important platform for the local place to cultivate the development of characteristic industries and promote the "going-out" of characteristic industries.
During some nights, the ionized layer is full of free electrons, which means that the radio signal can go further.
According to the report of Popular Science, an American monthly website, on August 11, the US Air Force was interested in copying this effect.
Although the stable ionizing layer with a large number of free electrons may help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station, but this may not be the interest of the US Air Force.
Ionization layer full of electrons indicated the radio used by the military has a larger range of broadcasts. In addition, it may prevent the global positioning system (GPS) signal from the solar storm.
The final goal may be to build a series of cube satellite according to the requirement. They may enhance ionization layer when necessary.
But firstly, the team that signed contract with the air force must prove that the scientific principles will work.
Industry data showed that the total size of coal production in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons and the national coal production overcapacity reached 1.8 billion tons.
Over the past decade, the State Council has issued a total of five notices for the elimination of excessive and backward production capacity.
Although the first four notices are not directly involved with coal industry, the target industry is directly related with coal industry.
From last November to this January, the price of Qinhuangdao 5500 kcal steam coal lingers at 370 yuan/ton and 90% of the coal enterprises fell into a loss.
And since February, coal prices gradually picked up, Qinhuangdao steam coal prices rose continuously for four weeks, rose to 16 months high, once climbed to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan per ton over the beginning.
With the price rising, come along the concerns of various industries: will a number of small coal mines resume production?
In this regard, Kuang Xianming, head of the Economic Research Institute of the China (Hainan) Reform and Development Institute, conducted an analysis and interpretation.
Kuang Xianming: overcapacity cut roused the high concerns to various industries. The report card of the overcapacity cut of the coal industry announced today make everyone feel worried indeed.
These three superficial factors reflect the reason behind the relative lagging behind of our growth pattern change. That is, the government-led growth has not yet been fundamentally changed.
Second, it is also directly related with the force of local government. During the overcapacity cut process, the funds and the corresponding supporting measures should be in place. From this point of view, the differences are indeed relatively large among different regions.
Thirdly, some of the provinces that are relatively slow in progress may face greater risks if they seek acceleration in progress in the second half of the year.
In this case, relying on the central allowance to raise funds to promote the process of production capacity may have a negative impact.
First, the overcapacity cut is not a simple cap control.
Our goal is to eliminate the backward production capacity, promote the optimization of the structure and restructure the new format of the entire coal industry.
During the process of overcapacity cut deploying, the local government must combine the production capacity and the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry to develop the relevant service industry.
Second, in order to complete this year's overcapacity cut task within this year, we must give full play to the power of administrative supervision.
Finally, we should strengthen the role of social security.
Because the market is directly related to the employment problem, we have to strengthen the employment skills training of employees.
"The reason for the ranking decline is that Brazilian GDP growth is expected to worsen in the medium term."
In 2015, Brazil's participation in global direct investment was 3.7%, down from 5.7% in 2014.

Last year, Brazil's "green investment" (in the investment model of building factories abroad) was $17.9 billion, a year-on-year fall of 2.1%.
"There are 288 'green land investment' projects in Brazil, with an average annual rise of 314 from 2003 to 2014".
However, in the first half of 2016, the international direct investment in Brazil had reached $33.8 billion, an increase of almost 10 per cent compared to the same period last year.
Title: Canadian police killed IS supporters: homemade bomb attacks downtown preparations near the end
The taxi company said the taxi was dispatched to the Dreyfus before the police arrived.
Canadian police said at a news conference on Wednesday that the information received by the police included the "martyrdom video" sent by the young man to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. According to the video, the young man will launch strike.
According to the German voice, in the video, a man wearing a black Barakella hat is reading the "Koran", referred to the crime against Muslims, and vowed to attack a Canadian city sooner.
He said in the video, the attack will occur within 72 hours, and in the rush hour.
The incident is the first time for the police to kill terror suspects before the incident after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to power last year.
Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal branch channels Old Wanfu River and Beidaliu will charge tolls since September 1.
The two tributaries will conduct construction via social financing. The charges have been approved by the relevant provincial government departments.
The old Wanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang, Yu Tai and then through the Nanyang Lake into the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel, with a total length of 32.5 km.
According to the navigation needs, the old Wanfu River channel takes the mode of conservation and transformation. Dredging was conducted on the local depth and curve cut-off on the local sharp bend. Then the navigation conditions can be improved.
The channel flows through Jinxiang County, Rencheng area and then through the Nanyang Lake into the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel, with a total length of 19 km.
The renovation project of the two waterway started construction in February 2011. The delivery inspection was conducted in January 2015. The investment construction and operation main body is Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center.
In accordance with the "loan construction and charging for repaying loan" principle, Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center will collect channel tolls according to the charge standard approved by Shandong Provincial Price Bureau.
Among them, the basic toll is 1.75 yuan/dwt and mileage toll is 0.05 yuan/km dwt.
The toll collection date is from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.
Reporters learned from Jining Port and Waterway Bureau that there are a total of 4 toll channels within Jining territory, including Zhushuihe Channel, Baima River Channel, Beidahang Channel and Laowanfu Channel.
These four channels are Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal tributary channels, which are upgraded and renovated in the way of social financing.
Zhushuihe Channel Upgrade Renovation Project is the first project adopting the mode of "government + market" for the infrastructure construction of river and ports within Shandong province. The government accounts for the major part of investment while social fund supplements the funding gap.
Baima River, the laowanfu River and Beidaliu River and other feeder routes adopt pure market operation.
The funds allocated by the state finance cannot meet the needs of the project construction and restrict the progress of the channel upgrade.
Social funds for the construction of public infrastructure are in line with national policy requirements and have become a way to break the bottleneck of funding.
Ning Zetao's performance in the 100 meters freestyle semi-final has made a lot of Chinese audience speechless.
Actually, this 50-meter freestyle is not the subject of Ning Zetao. His performance and best achievement in Kazan World Championships also indicate it is not possible for him to make breakthrough in this project.
Sure enough, Ta Kung Pao, an authoritative media in Hong Kong, revealed that the biggest reason for Ning Zetao to lose is that he has lost interest in swimming.
Many factors may have a great impact on his future ideas. He is now more interested in entering the entertainment circle.
After Kazan World Championships, Ning Zetao instantly become celebrity with his good look and excellent performance.
As a result, "national husband (a good match)", "fresh little meat", "gorgeous", etc. have become his label.
A variety of business activities came to him. He really have a golden flashing prospect.
In this case, that Ning Zetao chooses to withdraw and joins the entertainment circle, is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable way.
After all, he is only 23 years old. After a certain degree of study, he can perform some TV series with his popularity.
But Ning Zetao needs to see whether he is qualified enough compared with his predecessors.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, the already 21-year-old Liu Xuan came to the end of athlete career.
The beautiful appearance of Liu Xuan makes her quickly remembered and also lays a foundation for her to join the entertainment circle.
After retirement, Liu Xuan starred in a number of TV series, and in 2013 she set up her own studio.
Tian Liang participated in the single and double ten-meter match of two Olympic Games, and won 2 gold and 2 silver.
But when he was defeated by his counterpart Hu Jia at the single 10-meter match in the 2004 Olympic Games, Tian Liang's competitive state slipped and it was said he was dismissed by the diving team.
But when he took along his daughter to participate in the variety show "Dad, Where Are We Going?", he became a focus.
The once gold generation Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing all participated in a variety of variety show.
It is worth mentioning that, Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng led the Chinese team and won champion in the 2008 Olympic Games men's team. Yang Wei even got his individual all-around gold medal twice and was called as the Almighty King.
And Chen Yibing has become a ring king while leading his team to win the champion in the 2012 Olympic Games men's team.
But after he was misjudged and lost the gold in the London Olympic Games, his magnanimous act won him so many funs.
However, these game players mainly focus on the venue, they just touch and then go at the variety show.
However, no matter whether they are retired or active athletes, they need to provide outstanding performance to win in the entertainment circle.
After all, athletes have just stepped into a new area, so it is just a space state for them in case of capabilities and connection.
Even for Tian Liang and Liu Xuan, who are not new in the entertainment circle, common people always think of their performance at the Olympic Games when mentioning them.
And the introduction of Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng at the variety show is always Olympic Games Champion.
Compared with these people, Ning Zetao is slightly weaker for the title of Swimming World Championships.
Compared with these people, the title of Ning Zetao, a swimming world championship, is not so great.
Moreover, compared with the withdrawal of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan and Yang Wei, etc. at their peaks, the withdrawal of Ning Zetao at 23 after some setback would cause immeasurable effects to the negative influence of his image.
After all, at the mention of athletes, people's requirements on athletes are "not seeking victory but for no fear of danger". Ning Zetao lags far behind from this point.
At the very least, Ning Zetao can totally rely on his great looks to win the support of thousands of huge fans.
It is a lot more difficult to be famous in the entertainment circle by just relying on good appearance than training.
You have to listen to your inner voice on your life path. But as for how to choose, Ning Zetao should be quite conscious.
On the surface, the online social platform expands our social circle and reduces people's loneliness.
The sphere of influence of social networking not only replaces the traditional telephone contact, but also gets down to the offline living circle, quietly changing the current social life of the people.
The benefits of online social network are obvious, convenient and quick, so it is particularly vulnerable to the favor of young people.
A survey of college students' social habits shows that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours on mobile phone and is almost inseparable to his mobile phone during their daily lives.
"Social network features low cost, fast transmission speed and simultaneous communication among several people. This meets the requirement of modern college students."
Expanding the interpersonal relationship circle, more equal dialogue, avoiding social concerns are major reasons for us to be fascinated with online chat.
New comers in the company love online exchange with colleagues. "We are not familiar with each other when we just come to the company. The likes and comments on social platform makes people much closer to one another. "
People who love to make friends also love online communication. "I lost contact with my friends due to some misunderstandings. We became familiar again after a few dialogues on the group chatting."
IT engineer Wu Yan is a profound social networking lovers. His majority social life occurred online and his online contact is several times than that of offline friends.
Wu Yan himself admitted that the network is more "in his element".
"You can respond to your friends when you are willing, because there is a lot of time to think over the words and you can express it more clearly.
"The communication hidden below one's ID can avoid interpersonal clash. This not only has room for maneuver, and even gives each other more time and space to thought and deeds."
"People of different identities have the same rights and efficiency to speech. Various social concerns during real life may be eliminated immediately on internet."
However, Xiaopeng, a friend of Wu Yan, thought that Wu Yan is a "very boring otaku."
Xiaopeng and Wuyan meet each other in the group chatting. They two get familiar with each other because they are active speakers.
Xiaopeng thought that Wuyan is quite different from the one on internet. He is quite bored and does not take the initiative to express his views. His words are repeated like this, "Oh, yes, right", or "I will check it online".
Lingshui police has been involved in the investigation while Lingshui traffic sector will also intensify efforts to rectify illegal operation of vehicles.

Journalists from Nanhai website learned from the Lingshui Li Autonomous County Public Security Bureau that, the police have now accepted these two cases. The reasons for the two cases, who did it and whether they are related and so on still need further investigation.

Not walking too far, they saw a group of people shouting, so they approached for curiosity.
Seeing the "little boy has just disappeared and the little girl desperately fluttered in the water, just with her little brain left above the water and keeping sinking", Huang Yilin, who learned how to swim hurriedly jumped to rescue people.
After jumping into the water, the 165cm-tall Huang Yilin found that she cannot touch the bottom!
The calm-looking river had rapids in the bottom.
But she still desperately swam to the little girl.
Huang Yilin said the river was muddy and run fast. The only 5-meter distance almost wore her out.
She tried her best to push the little girl to the embankment. "The slope is particularly slippery, and I am afraid that I have no strength but to sink."
So Huang Yilin called to her mother for help. Hearing her daughter's call, Ms.Yin tried to rescue and was held up by other people.
On August 10, after the spread of the event of Huang Yilin's jumping into the river for rescue. Ms. Yin received the condolences and compliments of a lot of friends and relatives as well as the "concerns" of many relatives and friends.
"Now, in retrospect, it's really scared! To be honest, when my child does not hold on to the riverbank, my heart is broken soon."
Ms. Yin said with a lingering fear that, despite the danger, she will still support her daughter's choice and she is proud of her daughter even if she was placed in that scene again!
Because she was forced to learn swimming, she seldom went to swim after mastering the skill. "I did not expect this skill really to come in handy."
According to Chen Yiyang, her supervisor, Huang Yilin is the "The Straight A Student" well-known in her class and ready to help.

The court trial of Nanyang Wolong District People's Court of Henan province found that the defendant Li Huiwang sent fraud information through the pseudo-base station equipment in Tongbai county and Nanyang district between September 30, 2009 and October 4, 2009.

Siberian tigers are currently classified as endangered (EN) by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List of Endangered Species.
According to the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department, the data jointly monitored by the United States and Russia and other countries in 1998 showed that Jilin Province only had 4 to 6 manchurian tigers and 3 to 5 Northeast leopards.
According to Yu Changchun, the Director of Jilin Provincial Department of Forestry Protection, Jilin province has gradually enhanced its conservation on wild animals in recent years. The number of populations of manchurian tigers and Northeastern leopards is growing significantly
The latest monitoring data in 2015 showed that 27 wild manchurian tigers and 42 Northeastern leopards were monitored within Jilin province territory.
The cooperation between China and Russia is significant for the population restoration and reproduction of manchurian tigers and Northeastern leopards, which are flagship species for the wild animal protection in the Sino-Russia boundary area,.
According to Jilin Provincial Forestry Department, Jilin Provincial government has established long-term stable cooperation and exchange mechanism with Russian government.

Sun Fujian is a Party cadre, but he lost his ideal and belief by violently breaking the discipline of the Party after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. In addition, he is not astringent and breaks the rules. Such deed is vile and grave indeed.
After the occurrence of this case and a number of media reports, this has become the focus of the case, with extremely bad social impact.
After the case, Haikou City Public Security Bureau of Interpol detachment leaders attach great importance and immediately organize a detachment of elite troops to take the initiative to investigate.
The police immediately pursued and attacked the suspect on the internet and took a variety of measures to control. In addition, the police contacted their colleagues of other cities to investigate the whereabouts of Wang.
As the suspect is a stealing recidivism and repeatedly dealt with by the public security organs, he has strong anti-reconnaissance capabilities. In addition, due to his long-term drug abuse, the often drug addiction makes trial work quite difficult.
Greenland sharks are also known as small head sleeping sharks, widely distributed in Greenland and the North Atlantic waters around Iceland. It has the length of 4 to 5 meters in their adult age.
But their growth rate is extremely slow, sometimes only about 1 cm a year, suggesting that Greenland shark may have an extra-long life.
Traditional dating methods usually use calcified tissue of animals. Some fins can use fins, but this calcified tissue is very scarce in Greenland sharks.
A new study led by Julius Nelson of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, turned to the use of Greenland shark's ocular lens for radioactive carbon dating.
This method had previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it is the first time to be used to determine the age of sharks and other fish.
Their analysis showed that the life span of the largest shark is estimated at 392 years old, with the error of 120 years old.
That is to say, this shark is aged at least 272 years old. The maximum age may be 512 years old.
In addition, the female Greenland shark is alleged to be sexually matured at about 4 meters in length. That is, it can only reach adulthood at least until the age of 156.
The researchers thus wrote in the paper that the Greenland shark was known as the vertebrate with the longest life span on the Earth, surpassing the age of the previous longevity champion black right whale (211 years).
Over the past year, the exchange reform results are significant, with RMB exchange rate remaining basically stable, but also laying foundation for promoting the internationalization of the RMB.
From the point of market performance, over the past year, the two-way floating characteristics of RMB exchange rate is outstanding. The elasticity of exchange is expected to be strengthened and the exchange rate is expected to be generally stable.
Ever since the exchange reform, the fluctuation of RMB against the US dollar often appears, with ups and downs during the process.
Last year, the last remittance measure before "8.11" exchange reform was carried out in 2005. The appreciation of yuan against dollar was significant during the last 10 years.
Since the implementation of the new exchange reform, the previous appreciation state of RMB was changed. The central parity rate of RMB exchange rate in one year was about 8%.
This October 1, the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the yuan, which will become SDR weight currency.
This week, China's General Administration of Customs released statistics show that the first 7 months of this year, China's import and export value of 13.21 trillion yuan, down 3% over the same period last year.
In July, China's total import and export value fell by only 0.9% year on year. In particular, China's export value had a year-on-year rise of 2.9%.
Relevant experts believed that despite the signs of stabilization in July, we should not have high expectations.
In July, China's total import and export valued 2.09 trillion yuan, a year-on-year fall of 0.9%.
Among them, the export was valued 1.22 trillion yuan, up 2.9%; the import was valued 873 billion yuan, down 5.7%; trade surplus was valued 342.8 billion yuan, an increase of 34%.
Although the total value of imports and exports fell year on year, the export data enjoyed growth. This is the fifth consecutive month for export to achieve growth since March this year.

In late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will go to Kenya to attend the 6th African Development Conference, according to the Evening News Peak of Voice of China.
The African Development Conference was dominated by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo, Japan or Yokohama, so this meeting will be the first move to Africa.
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said the meeting held in Africa will help to attract attentions of African and European countries to Japan.
In line with the trip of Shinzo Abe, according to Kyodo news agency, the Japanese Liberal Democrats will send parliamentary groups to the countries concerned.
Japan's "application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council" began in the early 90s of the last century while the African-sponsored African Development Conference also began in 1993. This is not a coincidence.
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations and is therefore an important ticket bunker of the United Nation. How can Japan give up Africa if it wanted to join the United Nations Security Council?
It will also exchange views with national stakeholders on the extreme organization of "Islamic State" and terrorist activities.
"Western Group" will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea Bissau.
Fumio Kishida, the current Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan has also recently stated the intentions of the African Development Conference at the UN Security Council.
Abe has announced here that in order to stabilize the stability of sub-Saharan African countries, it will provide 100 billion yen (about RMB 6.1 billion) in five years.
Observers generally believe that there are two purposes behind Japan's generosity toward Africa: first, to increase Japan's presence in Africa; second, to win the support of African countries on the application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
"In terms of politics, Africa is relatively lagging behind, but there are many African countries. So Japan has always regarded it as the so-called 'big ticket field,'" said Yang Bojiang, an expert for Japanese issues.
Japan will not give up in the future and its work on Africa will not be terminated but gradually strengthened.
Economically, Japan enjoys a strong production capacity, but its domestic market is relatively limited. In particular, the domestic demand is relatively weak in the context of aging population.
However, from Junichiro Koizumi, who was Japan's prime minister 10 years ago, to the present Abe, Japan has repeatedly launched the "sprint" scheme. However, all schemes were abandoned eventually.
Yang Bojiang believed that the intension of Japan to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council is be clear at a glance. However, the road is bound to be full of obstacles.
To achieve its own goals, Japan should firstly do a good job with the surrounding countries. And Japan needs to have a correct attitude no matter in geopolitical competition or in the national dispute or understanding of a historical problem.

Gongs and drums of music, the traditional snacks, fancy decoration and stormy crowd scene.

In addition to the continuation of the existing "Climbing Competition", "parent basin for the heap" for the entire family is also added.
Bon culture history is introduced in the form of comic books. In addition, Bon theme 3D self-timer area, traditional snack area and traditional craft flow classroom are set up at the scene, attracting many friends and overseas travelers for visit.
A French couple lingered at the scene for almost 3 hours and experienced a lot in the mini flower card flow classroom.
"After knowing this special festival online, I decided to come and I felt quite fresh."
They said, although there are similar festivities commemorating the ancestors, the atmosphere is quite solemn. But here you can enjoy music, food and also can learn traditional craft.
She said, "It is quite pleasant to see sizable and organized ancestor worship ceremony in such a busy financial metropolis of Hong Kong".
"This not only embodies the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to understand these traditional craft and heritage."

As the key performance project of "Sino-Latin American Cultural Exchange Year", from August 9 to 23, China National Peking Opera Theater performed seven opera in the Mexican capital Mexico City and Córdoba, Juarez and other five cities.
The audience sometimes smiled and sometimes applauded for the changing and concluding of the "White Snake" episode and the actor's singing.
I watched the performance of Marissa Jimenez Kachie accompanying her daughter in the Peking opera performance 15 years ago.
"This is a fantastic performance. Its music, lighting and stage performances are impressive to me ... ... I think it is necessary to let her daughter understand the Chinese culture and Chinese opera art."
The enthusiasm of Mexican audience left a deep impression on the young actress of lady white.
"It never occurred to me that the Mexican audience were so enthusiastic. I had some worries about whether they could understand the story, but it was beyond my expectation to see them catch the story and the laughter today.
Qiu Xiaoqi, the Chinese ambassador to Mexico, said that the various cultural exchange activities of this year's "Sino-Latin American Cultural Exchange Year" promoted the two peoples to deepen mutual understanding and enhance their friendship.

Liu Cigui came to Sanya for the research of "Double Restoration and Dual City" and required to enhance the level of urban construction and management
In the morning of 12th day of the month, Liu Cigui presided over a symposium, listened to the report of the progress of the pilot project of "Double Restoration and Dual City" and the suggestions and comments of the relevant departments.
Liu Cigui provided fully affirmation for the stage results and good experiences and practice.
Liu Cigui stressed that Sanya should firmly grasp the historical development opportunities and take the pilot work of "Double Restoration and Dual City" as key content to give full play to the leading role of demonstration during the economic and social development in order to firmly grasp historical development opportunities.
We should lead to improve the internationalization of international tourism and enrich international elements and build international boutique from the details.
We should lead in the urban and rural integration and tourism, accelerate the construction of characteristic town and integrate tourism into each project and build each village and town of Sanya into tourist attractions.
We should lead in "the 100-day social service investment move" and promote a batch of key projects and park construction to ensure the settlement of high-quality project and implement the various requirements of the big move.
Zhang Qi, the Provincial Standing Committee and Sanya Municipal Party Committee Secretary, Wang Lu, vice governor and Lu Zhiyuan, secretary general of provincial government participated in the research seminars.
In the 14 years of her sports career, Deng Yaping won a total of 18 world championships, becoming the first Chinese to win four Olympic gold medals in China's Olympic history.
She ranked first in the table tennis for 8 years to maintain the world's first and is a female athlete to rank as the "the world's first" for the longest time in the history of table tennis.
On September 26, 2010, she served as Deputy Secretary-General of People's Daily, general manager of People's Search Network Co., Ltd. and the department-level cadre.
Recently, she will work together with Yu Minhong to build the first domestic sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform.
There was also a team of star coaches in the Chinese sports circle. They were gorgeous in the era of athletes and won countless glory for the country. After retirement, they passed what they learned to the new comers and cultivated a great number of champions.
As the first world champion in Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yubin chose to pick up the pointer after retirement.
From the women's team coach to the men's team coach, to the head coach, Huang Yubin created an "Olympic gold group", and led to win 9 gold, 1 silver and 4 copper at the Beijing Olympic Games.
Since then, Tian Liang has been experiencing advertising endorsement. He has even served as a "Cowherd", "Lei Feng" and other important roles in recent years.
Many NBA players have proved their strength. But whenever there is progress, there is decline.
Whether it is because of the increase in age or limited playing time, some players will have regressive performance each season.
Of course, some "retreat" may only be data shrink, but the strength of these players may not have been reduced.
Even if Wade is still one of the league's best linebacker, his performance in the Bulls is not so good as that of the Heat.
The backcourt range of he and Londo is limited. The three-point hit rate of headed star Butler is just 32.8%, making their next-season offence quite challenging.
After coming to Feng Cheng, the Red Star will definitely give the ball right to Butler and Rondo and he himself choose to play healthy in the regular season.
Okafor's situation is more embarrassing. As the first choice of 76 people last season, he had to compete for playing time and ball right with Simmons and Enby in the new season.
This competition may not come soon. Simmons also need to adapt to the NBA stadium, and Enbi must also be fully recovered from the injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafor can have a position in the long array of 76 people.
Last season, 32% of the score of Okafor comes from the low attack. Such rate is higher than Cousins, Wuchevich and Brook Lopez, while his use rate is also the top 40 in the league.
With Simmons already showing a good point-forward potention, Enbi also has a better stature more suitable for NBA games and Okafor's position is hard to be so solid.
Over the past two seasons, Thompson's use rate has stabilized in the top 20 of the league and this is the best two seasons for his career.
But the problem is, with the arrival of Durant, Thompson's appearance ratio will surely decline, which is bound to affect his play.
This effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots, Thompson's holding attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced, which in some ways will reduce the opponent's defense difficulty.
Durant's arrival will certainly negatively affect the score of Warriors players, but the one with the most negative effect is probably that of Thompson.
But this does not mean that the level of Thompson steps backward. This is more likely that he made sacrifice for the team as a whole.
Parker had a better performance than last season. This is not only because his basket efficiency came to the highest level, his chemical reaction with Aldrich also benefits the Spurs.
Duncan retired, Ginobili announced a second battles for a year and the combination of GDP eventually came to an end. As one of the youngest among three people, the oil tank of French sports car is not much left.
After getting the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular MVP than that of James, while Jordan was the only one who had more FMVP than that of James.
Oh, yes, James has just brought the first professional sports championship trophy in Cleveland in the past 52 years.
Coming to the 14th season of his career, James needs to better conserve his strength and get ready for the playoffs.
Therefore, in the regular season, James's capability is likely to further decline, he will give more weight to Owen to bear, but he will still easily become the league's top three players.
"I must carry forward what I learned in China to apply to Russia".
On the 12th day of the month of the local time, Huang Jing, chairman of the Moscow Overseas Chinese Association said excitedly while she saw the reporter of Chinanews.com.
Not long ago, she participated in the "overseas Chinese culture community Chinese talent (calligraphy, painting) training" hosted by Chinese State Council Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and sponsored by Jinan University.
While participating in the training course just now, she did not know where to start in painting and calligraphy. As a result, after the end of the course, she has been able to draw and write her own works.
After returning back to Moscow, I will use the knowledge and skills learned in China to Russia and make my own contribution for the cultural transmission and promotion of the Chinese culture.
At the same time, Na Yanwei, the Secretary-General of Russian-Chinese Culture Promotion Association who also participated in this training course had the same feeling.
She said that she made great progress with the help of teachers of the training classes and she felt the heavy responsibility of being the "overseas communicator of Chinese culture"
She said, after she came back to Russia, she would surely carry out the traditional Chinese culture among the Chinese and the Russians who love Chinese culture.
At 19:35 today, in one match of the 22nd round of Chinese Football Association Super League, Chongqing Lifan Football Club challenged Beijing Guoan Talent Football Club in the visiting field.
At the 29th minute, Wang Dong led to scoring one ball. At the 39th minute, with assistance by Fernando, the new support Kardec won the first score of the Chinese Football Association Super League. At the 81st minute, Guoan regained a score.
When the match went on for 10 minutes, Lifan made continued hit and gained a chance for corner. Fernando made small-angle volley and was fended off the base line by Guoan.
At the 15th minute, Zhang Xizhe flip through in straight line of the midfield. Ilmaz has been straight for the penalty area and the defensive Liu Yu grab the first leg of the ball and made a fight.
One minute later, Pu Cheng crossed on the left wing and Yu Dabao strafed the unkicked-out part of the mid-way in the penalty area. Lifang goalkeeper Deng Xiaofang confiscated the goal.
Fernando flipped pass the goal in the back-drawing on his right wing. Alan Kardec was put down by Lei Tenglong. The referee sentenced a spot kick and showed a yellow card to Lei Tenglong.
Guoan changed a person at the 37th minute. Zhang Xiaobin left the playing field and Zhang Chiming came on the stage and turned his weapon around to defense.
Alan Kardec get rid of the ball in front of the penalty area and Fernando pushed shot.

Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.
But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team.
It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
It has been some journey for GB.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost just one.
This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.
Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.
It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.
With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing, which was converted.
12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.
A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji.
On seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17-0 to the bad.
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.
The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.
It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.
Which is pretty much how it is.
GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.
Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.
The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle
There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height.
Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, it was touch and go.
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.
If they don't it goes everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It alters your outlook a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough.
That's how it starts off.
Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.
In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams, who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."
It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well.
It's been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.
Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much in the moment.
Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything amazing.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.
The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.
For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," she said.

Bulgaria Posts Inflation for 1st Time in 8 Months
Inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July, national statistics show.
This is the highest value in years (since June 2012) and the first one above zero since October of last year when a positive 0.2% was posted.
The annual average inflation, measured by CPI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, an increase was observed in the price of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); recreation and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%); furnishings, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month in alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any missteps quickly enter the public record.
Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."
And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.
Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."
She added that "it's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.
It shows that the filter isn't just yellowface, but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decisions like this," Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, "or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up."
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.
For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."
Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says
Officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday.
The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this much is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continued.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).
But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.
The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown With Britain
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.
"I have no clue," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.
The first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin.
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.
Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.
The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.
"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.
She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.
She is on a roll.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.
The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.
His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.
"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.
"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.
Strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.
In researching the book, which includes recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.
As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.
"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.
He was fabulously out of touch.
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."
Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.
The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.
"She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."
There was the cream-puff incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Mr. Coe went back for seconds, and thirds.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that the crude oil production in July continued to increase and Saudi Arabia's output hit a new high.
The report cannot prevent the market from doubting the credibility of OPEC. Oil recovery path is still bristled with thorns.
On Monday, OPEC Chairman and Qatar Energy Minister Sada said OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
The monthly report of OPEC on Wednesday showed that the output of the entire OPEC organization in July, including Gabon, increased by 46,000 barrels/day to 33.11 million barrels/day.
OPEC also said in a monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil, thus increasing the degree of excess supply to the market.
Affected by this news, coupled with the production output expectations of rising crude oil and the unexpected increase in crude oil inventories, aggravating the excessive market supply.
As of Wednesday's close, the light crude oil futures of New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 2.48% in September and the future price of crude oil in October in London Brent fell by 2.07%.
Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of the oil-producing countries is unlikely to tighten the supply. The data released by US Energy Information Administration also suppress the market sentiment.
Iran's official news agency Fars on Wednesday, quoting the speech of Zanganeh, Iranian oil minister, said that Iran's daily crude oil production was up to 3.85 million barrels, which has been the highest level since 2008.
At the release of the news of the meeting, the Russian energy minister Novak said that it was unnecessary to conduct a new round of frozen production negotiations under the current oil price.
It was April when the oil-producing countries had meeting. No agreement was reached among the OPEC member countries.
Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMIResearch, said the market and the media could react excessively to OPEC's meeting.
Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC changed the market sentiment by releasing signals that they would make an agreement.
This means like a smoke and a mirror that draws people's attention (deliberately giving a false impression).
Eugen Weinberg, director of commodity research at the German commercial bank, said the possibility of OPEC trying to stabilize the market through the September meeting was low.
This is likely to further undermine the market confidence in OPEC. After all, this organization already staged a "wolf is coming".
All localities should take medical institutions which have illegal medical advertising, complaints focusing on the past and have repeatedly been punished as a focus of inspection.
National Health Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will timely carry out supervision on the supervision and inspection work of some provinces.
According to media disclosure, the large influx of capital into the Internet medicine has resulted in the serious problem of current product homogeneity. Investment boom fade gradually and capital came into the wait-and-see period.
According to the data of Hong Kong Ai Li Pi Hospital Management Research Center, a large number of start-up Internet medical companies languished just within one year and about 20% of the start-up Internet medical companies has ceased to exist.
However, just as the majority of Internet medical companies struggle in the road of A round or B round of financing, several sub-areas leading enterprises can still get the capital touted.
It seems that the Internet medical business shall not "swarm", but to see the needs of the market, and be professional and profound.
Yuyue invested 12 million yuan, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, while Jiuzhoutong invested 18 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the country providing policy support in the medical information, electronic and integrated supply chain management system gradually enter the hospitals at all levels.
The cooperation between Yuyue and Jiuzhoutong is aimed at the needs of the market, helping the hospital to build advanced supply chain management system, and take this opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet medical companies which go in for grandiose projects, iBaby focuses on the Internet obstetrics vertical field and be professional on pregnant mothers and doctors.
Pregnant women can not only enjoy 24 hours of medical services free of charge and one-on-one inquiry with doctors, but also pay for medical counseling.
At the doctor's side, iBaby breaks the geographical restrictions by taking the form of organizing experts to give grassroots doctors an online lecture, peer exchange, case discussion and so on.
At present, three plates are set up for doctor's client side, respectively, for doctors to continue education, social exchange and communication.
The following services are provided, including online learning, case discussion and academic exchange; social platform for the exchange of doctors of the same hospital and department; legal assistance, business support and other services required by doctor-patient relationship or personal life.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali health "is willing to get down" to win big health data.
Internet companies and data companies are short of professionalism. No unity can be provided on the same entry.
The layout of Ali in the medical and health field is divided into three plates, namely, Ali Health, Lynx Pharmacy and Alipay future hospital.
Wang Lei admitted that it was more difficult for medical and health companies to start up than other industries, "This is not just how much money you have. In addition, it requires people to be concentrated on it and endure the loneliness.
Staying up late watching the Olympic Games will damage the heart easily
Brazil Olympic Games is in full swing. Even if the event is broadcast in the midnight in China, many people will stay up late to watch.
In this regard, the doctor reminded that staying up late has health risks and may lead to cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up for a long time, the hormone will have a lot of secretion and your body will continue to be in a state of intense excitement and cannot have normal recovery. This may easily cause vasoconstriction, blood pressure and thus cardiovascular disease.
Han Zhiyuan reminded people who have high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipids, smoking habits, family history and other cardiovascular risk factors may easily suffer from cardiovascular disease if staying up late.
If you stay up late, then your cardiovascular function will be affected, your gastrointestinal function, immune system, neuroendocrine system will also be affected, and even the risk of cancer will increase.
For old friends, Han Zhiyuan suggested them better not stay up late to watch games, particularly those with cardiovascular disease.
During the last "World Cup" football match, Han Zhiyuan received a 60-year-old patient. His onset of myocardial infarction may be related with staying up late to watch games.
According to Han Zhiyuan, his department had treated some 25-year-old myocardial infarction or stroke patients. This is largely due to long-term stay up of patients.
1. Do not stay up late every day. You can occasionally stay up all night watching the favorite sports and watch the rebroadcast for other sports next day.
2. You may drink more water, have more fruit during stay up as this can prevent blood clogging and enhance your body immunity.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union transported the missile into Cuba, which almost led to the US-Soviet nuclear war.
This event was seen as the pinnacle of the cold war, known as the "Cuban missile crisis."
But what is little known is that during the Cold War, a strong solar storm has almost led to a nuclear war of the United States against the Soviet Union. The incident has not been announced by the researchers until August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused strong interference to the radar and radio communications of the US military in the Arctic.
These radars were part of the ballistic missile early warning system of the US, used for monitoring Soviet missiles.
This paper was written by researchers at the University of Colorado, who interviewed US military personnel involved in the forecasting and analysis of solar activity and reviewed non-confidential documents.
The paper wrote that in the 1960s, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching nuclear war, the US Air Force has always had some fighters with nuclear warheads flying in the sky.
US military commanders did not know that the culprit of the interference was the solar storm rather than the Soviet Union, so they ordered the fighters to enter combat readiness state.
Fortunately, the US military force had started the study of solar activities and its electromagnetic interference to the Earth since the 1950s, it ultimately stopped this potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the US Air Force Air Meteorological Service and submitted a detailed report.
The direct consequence of this solar storm is that the US military has seen space weather as a combat concern and has built a stronger space weather forecast system.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly issued a new version of "US-Japan defense cooperation guidelines" in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role in the world.
This is the day the US Defense Secretary Carter, US Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Japan's Minister of Defense Gen Nakatani attended the press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time that China's civilian think tank has published the Japanese military assessment report and the fourth launch of the English version.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including the overall policy adjustment, military strength, defense budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, military system reform, military training, foreign military security cooperation and military security relations with China and so on.
The report said that the year 2015 is a phased last year of the Abe government to promote major policy adjustments in the security area.
Since then, Japan's initiatives in the field of security will be mainly in the legal system, strategy implementation, policy implementation and other operational level, rather than the substantial adjustments and changes of framework, mechanisms and policies.
The report emphasized that the Abe Cabinet tried to break through the above three points to achieve the promotion of Japan's "normal nationalization", and the going-out of militia to intervene in international security affairs, strengthen Japan-US alliance and prevent the rise of China and resist China.
Previously, the China Strategy and Culture Promotion Council released the Japanese military assessment report on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014 and June 30, 2015.
British "Financial Times" on August 12 released a group of pictures on mansion of US ambassador to China.
According to the article, in contrast, the appearance of the American ambassador's residence, from the appearance of view, can be used as safety house in the cold war spy novels of John le Carré.
The residence is gray, and strongly fortified by peripheral fence, the second interior wall, barbed wire entanglement and vehicle roadblocks.
Improvement of public sports facilities
Dark coal field warehouse is turned into a "green grass" football field while red brick spire plant is turned into a modern sports museum.
On the national fitness day, Nanluo Maying Sports Culture Park, outside the Hangzhou Wangjiang gate, unveiled its mysterious veil.
It was a coal field once and remained idle for more than 10 years after its closure. A large number of illegal construction and garbage were left behind.
After the renovation, it became a sports and cultural park, and will be officially opened in November to the public free of charge to provide sports venues. In addition, it would undoubtedly open up a new fertile soil for the whole people.
This reminds people of Hangzhou Chen Jinglun School. This is a "Whampoa Military Academy" in China's swimming world, in which several world champions were born.
Swimming champions will be produced continuously, producing a vivid interpretation of the relationship between competitive sports and national sports. The profound mass base provided a good condition for selecting professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of national sports. Athletic sports depend in a certain sense on national sports, and national sports depend on the conditions of the site.
According to reports, as of 2015, the area of China's per capita sports venues has been 150 times of that when the new China was established, but still far behind the sports power.
In June this year, the State Council issued a "National Fitness Program (2016 - 2020)" and took the development of mass sports as a key content.
In order to fill the short board, on the one hand, the relevant departments shall take full account of the layout of the stadium at urban planning.
On the other hand, the already built public sports venues, including schools and other units in the sports venues, should try to expand the scope of openness and try to improve efficiency as much as possible.
The Rio Olympic Games, which is in full swing, has stimulated people's enthusiasm for sports, but also aroused everyone's awareness of participation.
Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, a U.S. district judge has ruled.
In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
In a filing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city.
They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations," he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns.
"Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers.
Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.
The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.
How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center.
Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.
The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."
The hotel's clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."
The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
It is in itself a great shame.
The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.
That needs no explanation.
We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.
Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.
"Shame on you," another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue.
The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.
It adds that the code was now added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.
Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money.
Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.
The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.
They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.
He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.
Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."
We all as a team came together in the last three months.
We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London.
If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits.
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
That would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
The team event is always the best.
You get to win it with your mates.
It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.
Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.
He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.
After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again.
After the little baby came to this world, Mom and Dad shall be responsible for his life, not only for his health, but also for the development of his spirit, that is, education.
If such education failed, then no matter how successful your career is, you cannot make up for the shortcomings of life and family failure.
When a new baby is born, the new dad and mom need to spend time in taking care of and educating him, and be responsible for him.
And responsibility is not only reflected in the care of body, making them healthy, but also the education of spirit. That is, to make children learn how to behave, grow up and succeed.
Good family education means that parents often need to accompany their children, to take care of them patiently and teach them develop a civilized behavior and make them learn knowledge better and enhance intelligence.
Parents' words and deeds will affect the growth of their children because they will imitate their parents. And that is the so called, "like father, like son". Your son will be the same as you.
So we need to be a good example in front of children, regulate our words, cultivate our characters, which will indirectly help children shape their own excellent character, so that he will become more excellent.
Amy is a smart and pretty girl.
She is outgoing and can get along well with friends. In addition, she can adapts to the environment quite well.
But Amy has a little secret in her heart: she cannot concentrate long on what she wants to do and works on.
This secret is accompanied by Amy for a long time. Usually the problem is not serious.
Even though she learns and works in decentralized, modular, she can complete the task basically, and achieve good results.
However, when the task is heavy and pressing, Amy feels very painful and tortured.
The individual's resistance to self-exposure and his emotional experience is to prevent the individual's self-awareness and self-esteem from threatening.
And some behaviorist psychologists understand the impedance as an individual's disobedience to their behavioral corrections.
I tried to let Amy do an exercise, let her breathe through the way to calm down and feel the torment.
And once he left the trapped situation, she felt relaxed and regained freedom.

4 years after Uber joined the Taiwan market, it caused no small impact on the local traditional taxi industry.
According to the information of Taiwan "United Daily News" on August 12, more than 100 taxies bypassed Taiwan Executive Yuan for protest. This resulted in serious traffic paralysis in the surrounding area.
It has been four years since the arrival of Uber in Taiwan, but the authority just launched the meeting at the end of this month. Drivers cannot wait any more, said Zheng Lijia, the chairman of Taipei Driver Union.
However, the government eat their words and delayed again and again.

Original title: The Owner of A Jiangsu Farm Was Punished Because He Disposed of The 2,000 Chicken Without Permission Which Were Checked And Detained By The Court
After the verdict comes into effect, because Lee did not automatically fulfill the obligation to determine the verdict, Wang apply for enforcement to the Shuyang court.
On October 16, 2014, Shuyang court made a civil ruling, and ruled that all of the 2,000 farm laying hens shall only be seized and shall not be transferred and sold without permission.
After Lee received the detention ruling, without the permission of the Shuyang court, he privately sold partial egg laying hens.
Until March 8, 2015 when Shuyang County Public Security Bureau conducted a survey, there were only 142 layers on the farm.
On August 12, reporters was informed that the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and the Winter Paralympic Organizing Committee issued a notice that the Beijing Winter Olympic Organizing Committee inherited the emblem and signs of Beijing Olympic Winter Games for commercial purposes.
Without the permission of the Beijing Winter Olympic Organizing Committee, no one shall use the emblem and signs of Beijing Olympic Winter Games for commercial purposes.
The head of the Department of Industrial Coordination of the National Development and Reform Commission said that iron and steel overcapacity is now a global problem.
China's capacity utilization in recent years is higher than the global average, but also higher than that of the United States and Europe and other countries and regions.
China has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging.
The official pointed out that the CPC Central Committee and State Council should attach great importance to the global problem of iron and steel overcapacity.
All departments and regions should actively implement the deployment of the State Council, earnestly carry out the work, and reduce crude steel production capacity by 45 million tons this year.
From China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports. On the contrary, it also takes a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The person in charge stressed that the international trade of iron and steel products is essentially a market behavior and an independent choice from the requirement of importing countries and after considering the product cost and other factors.
The implementation of trade protection measures does not help to fundamentally solve the global steel industry development issues. On the contrary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade order.
When it comes to debt, the person in charge stressed that the resolution of the debt problem is to properly handle the important issues that need proper handling.
As the iron and steel enterprises are large-scale and involve a wide range of enterprises, the debt relationship is complex. It may lead to regional risks if disposed of improperly.
According to the person in charge, in recent years, with the economic downward pressure to increase, the total social demand gradually weakened, part of the industry capacity utilization decreased and enterprise production and management difficulties increased.
Some enterprises do not meet the changes in the market environment and the production and management is difficult to sustain or even on the brink of collapse. But restrained by some institutional factors, they become "zombie enterprises" due to many obstacles to the market.
The existence of these companies distorted market signal, reduced the elements resources use efficiency, increased the cost of social management, thereby hindering the establishment of market environment with fair competition.
The main reason for the loss is the same as the dilemma faced by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low utilization rate.
China mainly adopts the market mechanism, economic means and the rule of law. The government is mainly to do the work of disclosing the ins and outs to workers and social stability, to ensure fair and equitable market order.
The person in charge stressed that the next step is to do a good job to ensure overcapacity cutting and ensuring the objective of resolving 100 million tons-150 million tons of crude steel production capacity within five years.
In the afternoon of the 10th day of the month, the appearance of Chinese tourist police in the Red Square in Moscow immediately drew people's attention. Chinese tourists waved with surprise, and the local people and foreign tourists cannot help but to stop looking back.

Moscow travel police are divided into three groups for duty patrol in the Red Square, Nicolieski pedestrian street and Gu Mu Department Store. The Chinese tourist police also followed for study. The whole process lasted more than an hour.
Female police officer Liu Xinie is 20-plus years old, proficient in English and Spanish. She just joined the tourism police team last year.
He carefully observed every word and action of the Russian counterparts and communicated with her from time to time.
When he saw Spanish tourists come for consultation, the Moscow travel police explained to him with fluent Spanish, which impressed Wang Bing.
"Every Moscow travel policeman master foreign language, and some even can speak more than two languages, which impressed us a lot."
"Hainan, as an international tourist island, is gradually paying attention to attract international tourists. We hope to improve their ability to match the status of international tourism island."
On the current day before the study, the Chinese tourist police also went to the brigade station of Moscow city police to communicate with their Russian counterparts.
"I often deal with Chinese tourists and I am very happen to see them travel to Russia."
"Their usual questions are: where is xxx, for example, where is a monument, how to rent a taxi and how to return to the hotel."
Lei Sakov, the brigade captain of Moscow city police said that in recent years, Moscow's urban environment and tourism ambience have become better and better, attracting more and more foreign tourists.
In order to meet the needs of tourism development, it set up a tourist police team in July 2014, responsible for patrol in the major scenic spots, thus helping and diverting the tourists.
At present, all Moscow tourist policemen are proficient in English and some also master Spanish and German.
The police brigade divided them into nine groups according to their foreign language levels. They have two classes per week, learn self-defense moves, laws and regulations and foreign languages.
"At present, there are two tourist police beginning to learn Chinese and they can speak fluently. We have to continue to improve their Chinese level," Lysakov said.
Lysakov told reporters that the Moscow Tourism Police since its inception, have accumulated a certain amount of experience and hoped to inspire counterparts in Sanya.
He believes that the cooperation between the Russian and Chinese police departments will enhance the security sense of their citizens to each other's national tourism.
"The recruiting, police mode and equipment of Moscow tour police officers and their excellent interactions with visitors have brought us a lot of inspiration." Chen Xiaokun said.
Chinanews journalist found that there are at least nine provinces and cities issuing rules for the implementation of residence permit, including Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian and Beijing, etc.
For the conditions of applying for residence permit, the above regions generally said that the applicants need to live more than six months and meet one of these three requirements: having legitimate and stable employment, having legal and stable residence and continuous study.
Chinanews journalist noted that in the aspect of residence permit providing treatment, the "gold content" is different in various cities. Compared with the national provisions, some areas have provided more public services and conveniences.
These areas have increased the conveniences of children to attend college entrance examination in the local place while meeting the related requirement.
In addition, it is clearly proposed by Beijing and other places that they will gradually expand the scope of public services and convenience, and regularly release to the community.
For example, Fujian proposed to announce the public services and convenience of residence permit holders to the public at least every 3 years
"Residence Permit Provisional Regulations" provides that, for those in line with the residence permit conditions, the public security organs shall issue a residence permit within 15 days from the date of acceptance.
For the time limit, most of the region hold the same opinion with the national version. That is, to release the permit within 15 days.
Hebei clearly stipulates that for applicants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents, the residence police station shall issue a residence permit within 3 working days from the date of acceptance.
Jiangxi clearly stipulates that for applicants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents, the public security shall issue a residence permit within 5 working days from the date of acceptance.
In accordance with the "residence permit provisional regulations", the above cities stipulate clearly that the cost of certificate production shall be exempted in case of initial application of residence permit.
For example, Sichuan required the local police stations or commissioned community service agencies shall strictly enforce the approved fees and charges standard and resolutely prohibit over-range, over-standard fees or ride fees.
It was found that on July 27, 2016, Chen Yangxia, the former Ganzhou City Dingnan County Party Secretary came to the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection for reporting and serving as director of the CPC supervision room (deputy director-general, one year's probation period).
The red wine at the dinner was provided by Li Youcai while other costs were borne by Liu.
Jiangxi Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection informed that Chen Yangxia and Cheng Ziliang, who organized and accepted dining invitation in private clubs, violated the spirit of the central eight provisions and the Party's discipline.
Last season, Pogba was punished with two yellow cards. He will be banned automatically according to the rules.
Although he has transferred back to the Premiership, the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup) still passes his accumulative suspension to FA Cup.
In this way, on August 14, in the away games of fighting against Bournemouth, Pogba will watch a fight without helping any party. His first show after return to Manchester United will be extended to Southampton's home game on August 20.
As the No.12 new arrival of the first round in 2014, Salic will officially land on the NBA in the next season, and join the Philadelphia 76ers.
As a young European player, Salic is not known to many fans. But I believe he impressed people with his performance in this Olympic Games.
In a game with win by a narrow margin of Croatian over Spain, Salici successfully blocked Paul - Gasol in his last moment and tried to drag the game into the overtime basket attack.
Recently, Brett-Brown, the commander-in-chief of the 76-team gave Salic a high rating. He thought he saw the shadow of young Manu-Ginobili in Saric.
It is quite obvious that Saric already showed his gift and made 76 people full of expectations.
In Croatia's first two games of the Olympic Games, Salic received a total of 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Salic showed his capability of drawing space on the scene. He can have a shot outside the three-point line via the pick and roll with his colleagues.
Although the current 76-team is packed with many gifted young players, they are not equipped with the outside scoring capability as Salic.
From block shot to launching a long pass, fast break and complete assists, there are just a few insiders who can do it on the NBA game.
Since the beginning of this Olympic Games, Salic has obtained 13 points, eight backboards and five assists in three games, with a full performance.
James has signed two 1 + 1 contracts since he decided to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014.
Now, as this labor agreement is about to enter the last year, James will be in the forefront of labor negotiations as the vice chairman of NBA player union.
The substantial increase in union revenue is attributed to the new television protocol. The question is how the boss and players deal with the money. The outside world is worried that the NBA will fall in the next summer.
But for James, he will not have to worry that he will become a free agent next summer because he has renewed a 3-year contract with the Cavaliers.
No matter when the 2017-18 season kicks off, James is within the contract.
Since the stunning debut of iPhoneSE, the mobile phone market also ushered in a small screen machine boom.
Not long ago, Nubia also launched the first works of its Z11 series: nubiaZ11mini.
NubiaZ11mini follows its consistent photographed gene, and is equipped with a one-hand easier-to-hold 5.0-inch screen, portable and convenient post-fingerprint recognition, contributing to its superior experience.
A small screen camera phone Z11mini, which was just listed by Nubia, had a price fall of RMB 200, decreasing from the original RMB 1499 to RMB 1299.
In appearance, nubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen. The classic "little red circle" design is below on the front side.
The middle frame is metal material. Its bottom adopts symmetrical design and is equipped with Type-C data interface.
Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.
The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.
A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.
And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.
The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant.
AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," it said.
AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.
Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event."
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."
The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
And as a generator that wouldn't be good for us," he said.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year, with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.
Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.
Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.
It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.
"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.
For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
A woman lay down in the dark on the road "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
Was it possible to avoid impact?
That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement.
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.
We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and right across the country, we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of around $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they ever will.
At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
According to Zheng Jianjun, the Management Section Chief of Nanhu Park Water Area, the deepest point of the South Lake is more than 10 meters deep. People who do not understand the situation of water are probably confronted with danger.
"Although the Nanhu Park rescue team is very professional, we still hope that the majority of rowing tourists can wear life jackets and stay away from illegal activities on the lake to play safely" Zheng Jianjun said.
Wai Tau Tsuen boasts a unique marine environment, with two leisure travel resources including natural ecology and cultural ecology.
"However, several owners who bought the parking spaces in the community feared that this would affect the price of their parking spaces and doubted that others were selfish, so they had been plotting for bad things. This had shelved the parking space transformation. "
As for the question about when the sweet potatoes are introduced and by whom, there are still many different versions in the academic community.
In the current mainstream view, there are three major lines for the introduction of sweet potato.
Among the three lines of introducing sweet potato, the introduction by Chen Zhenlong from Philippine to Fuzhou is the one with the greatest impact and largest communication.
Beijing Municipal Social Management Office will soon carry out special inspections on the use of unified receipts of social group membership fees.
Inspection is divided into two categories, unit self-examination and spot inspection.
Relevant person in charge of the municipal association said, the scope of the inspection covers social groups who received unified receipts of social group fees in the social mass organization between 2013 and 2015.
"The success of the Olympic Games is defined by people who share stories in social media," said the Rio Olympic Organizing Committee while establishing the communication strategy of 2012 Olympic Games.
From the news reports of the Olympic Games, all media have made a lot of changes in the aspect of mode of transmission, product form, language style, news perspective and many other aspects.
It seems that the International Olympic Committee and the media practitioners around the world will have to meet this round of challenges.
On August 11, this is the last day for the open sale of Everbright Securities H shares. News went that the market response was not special for market of the previous two days. According to the plan, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18.
A domestic brokerage analyst said that the Orient Securities in Hong Kong did not enjoy a good foundation. Only its capital management business is its strength. It has many inherent problems compared with Bank of China International and CITIC Securities, etc.
Experts pointed out that with the return of the securities market to flatness, many brokers sagged this year in results. But the detailed situation of the listed companies is dependent on the detailed development of the corporate business and cannot be generalized.
After the introduction of the regulation of the new deal, Suzhou will become the first second-tier city to restart the purchase restriction.
In addition to Suzhou, other second-tier cities including Hefei and Nanjing will also introduce the property market regulation and control policies.
Prior to this, Hefei has been the first to issue restrictions on lending policy. For people who have two suites in Hefei and have one housing loan not paid, they will be denied with the mortgage services from bank.

Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.
A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.
They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.
"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.
"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.
After experiencing the “golden era” of a soaring box office in 2015, the film market retreated into a cooling-off period in 2016. Whether box office takings could surpass last year’s total of RMB44.069 billion is questionable.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed that in October, prices of new and second-hand residential properties cooled, up 0.6% and 1.1% month-on-month, respectively.

BBC claims that Beijing has become the most exciting city: making foreigners feel like “living in a new age”
Reference News Network reported on January 18 that the British media organization has noticed that Beijing is rapidly transforming into a glamorous modern city in spite of the fact that it is 3000 years old.
The Chinese capital is interconnected by amazingly high-speed Internet and has implemented cutting-edge technologies such as face recognition. It has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has an unmatched capacity of internationalization. It is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who are eager to explore the world.
According to a report on the BBC website on January 16, the German expatriate Clemens Sage said: 'If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere.' He quoted a song written by singer Frank Sinatra to praise New York City.
Sage, who served as Creative Director of Traveler Archives, said: "If Sinatra lives today, he is likely to sing a song for Beijing." He said that living in this city will make you feel like “living in a new age”, which means that you can always keep up with the trends.
Simon Norton, who originates from England had been living in Beijing in recent years, published an article on personal blog site 4Corners7Seas saying: “People generally have a feeling of being at the center of something grand. Although this feeling is hard to describe clearly, it is the reason why so many foreigners stay there for a long time. They want to see what it will become and hope to witness it. ”
According to reports, the city's high-quality, high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever before.
Andy Peñafuerte, who originates from Manila and is currently the deputy editor-in-chief of the website Beijing Children, said: "Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society. The Internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smart phones, making it easier for everyone to conduct various transactions."
According to reports, smart phones are just the beginning of Beijing's technical ambitions. Face recognition technology is being widely used across the city. Many mobile phone applications use this technology to facilitate bank transfers and payments, grant people access apartments and offices, and even use it to verify identity of the drivers providing car-hailing service.
Beijing recently announced plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan in the construction of an artificial intelligence technology park. When it is completed, more than 400 companies will settle there. They will focus on the development of artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food plays a central role in China’s many major traditional festivals. Foreigners are enthusiastic about these festivals. The Spring Festival is the most important festival in both social and economic sense, and it is also one of the most enjoyable festivals for foreigners.
Sage said: “It's a pleasure for me to help Chinese friends prepare for the New Year. It is equally important to clean the apartment and paste the red spring couplets with blessing words on the door. On New Year’s eve, all family members must gather together to have a good meal and stay until midnight, and finally to celebrate the New Year with fireworks. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and their family is indeed an opportunity for blending. ”
According to reports, a large number of foreigners are living in Beijing and the number is growing. However, the language barrier and the convenience of exchanges between the expatriates can easily become excuses for not fully integrating into the local culture.
Sage said: 'Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but they have little experience with their host country. If your initial attempt to interact with the Chinese is not successful, then it is easy for you to feel more comfortable with other foreigners.
In these so-called 'foreign bubbles' ('Laowai bubble' refers to circles in which foreigners only mixed in with foreigners, without touching local people and local culture -- translator's note), foreigners mingle with each other in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only make friends with foreigners.
The easiest way to overcome problem is to learn a little bit of Mandarin – something easier than one might think.
Sage said: “One or two hours of private lessons in Chinese every week or learning entry-level radio dramas should suit everyone’s busy schedule.”
Even learning a few classic phrases will help with shopping, ordering a meal in a restaurant, or chatting on a taxi.
According to reports, persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life, but the government has tried to curb pollution in recent years.
Residents emphasize that outdoor activities are very important in warm months when pollution is often light. It is important to consider those blue sky days as opportunities for rambling in ancient encryptors or exploring the popular Ritan Park.
Norton said: "Beijing is a Chinese city that one can find most things below the surface. You can find very good arts and music activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient hutong areas."
The report believed that the hindrance to growth in human capital as a result of aging has become increasingly apparent. This was particularly the case in the Northeast, where the annual average contribution of aging to human capital growth was -1.28%.
Pan Gongsheng said that the present of risk of cross-border capital flows can be controlled. The fundamental factors underpinning international balance of payments will still exist over the longer term.
China News Service Beijing December 17 wire (Reporter: Gao Kai) Heritage makes the world resplendent - The opening ceremony of the 2016 International Summit for the Authentication, Restoration and Protection of Ancient Chinese Calligraphy and Painting was held at Renmin University of China on December 17.
In April this year, the European Commission accused Google of coercing mobile phone manufacturers into installing software such as the Google search engine and Chrome web browser, or they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The European Commission believed that this harmed consumer interests and hindered competition.
EU regulators initially requested that Google make a response prior to July 27.
If found guilty of violating antitrust rules, Google could face a maximum fine of 10% of its global turnover, or approximately US$7.4 billion.
Google has not made immediate comment on this.
Google also faced EU investigations over giving prominent placement to its own shopping services in search results.
Zhang Yuning's stay-abroad is a real one. It can be said that his achievement of “jumping level” from the national youth to the national Olympics is by no means accidental, and his leap-forward growth is still surprising.
Understand through a picture: Bitcoin's legal status around the world
Abstract: A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation, the current round of digital currency tumble has also to do with the 'sworn enemy'—regulation.
From the visualized maps, the attitude of the eastern countries towards Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West. Most countries in the world are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies, indicating that the “risk of the black swan” is still looming large.
*This article is taken from Wallstreetcn (WeChat ID: wallstreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more exciting information, visit wallstreetcn.com or download the Wallstreetcn APP. *
As the authorities in major markets of Bitcoin -- such as China, South Korea and the European Union -- take decisive regulatory measures, the digital currency market dominated by Bitcoin has experienced major bloodshed this week. The price of Bitcoin has fallen below 10,000 dollar, recording the biggest one-day drop.
A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation, the current round of digital currency tumble has also to do with the 'sworn enemy'—regulation.
At this important juncture, HowMuch.net, a visualization big data website, produced a map showing the legitimacy of Bitcoin and regulation measure in place in countries around the world.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legal market for Bitcoin, and orange represents the neutral market. Although there is no place where Bitcoin is acknowledged a legal currency, there are no major restrictions on the use it. The pale pink represents the restricted market, i.e. the local government tries to the use of the digital currency pass by drawing a red line or taking regulatory measures. The deep pink represents countries where Bitcoin is declared as illegal. The gray represents countries that have not yet been rated.
(The above figure was drawn by the HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15th)
The article points out that from the distribution of non-green color patches in the graph, it can be seen that the oriental countries in the traditional sense are more conservative towards Bitcoin than the West.
Russia is currently the largest country that defines Bitcoin as illegal. China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin. India is one of the largest countries that have not commented on Bitcoin and have not made relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions that have highest level of tolerance to Bitcoin i.e. where green patches are concentrated.
The views of the countries in the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are clearly divided, so, the distribution of color patches in these areas is more mixed.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil are all legitimate Bitcoin markets. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bolivia have some restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin. Most Latin American countries have not made any comments about Bitcoin.
From the above data, it can be seen that of the 246 countries that have been rated, a total of 99 countries (or 40% of the total) haven't imposed any restrictions on the transactions and use of Bitcoin. They are represented by green and orange patches.
Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) have defined Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53) %) haven't given comments on digital currency (grey).
This shows that countries that account for the global majority (53%, more than half) are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies represented by Bitcoin. This means that the “black swan risk” is still very large for Bitcoin, because some of these countries may ultimately make legislation that restrict the use of digital currencies.
The article believes that global regulators have not fully understood the digital currency as a new type of currency. This may be the main reason why most countries have not chosen a stance.
Although Bitcoin’s popularity has grown exponentially since last year, it does not necessarily mean that all countries are interested in it. It's probably that some countries are concerned that the local currency may be undermined by digital currencies or that digital currencies are used by criminal organizations.
Wallstreetcn has published an article summarizing the news related to regulation measures against Bitcoin across the world since last week, including: China starts to crackdown on online platforms and mobile APPs of over-the-counter exchanges; South Korea is still considering to close the digital currency exchanges; the European Union holds the view that Bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of “losing everything”.
Wallstreetcn Editor's selection: Reading News | 2018: Global Central Banks Are Ushering Digital Currency? One article points out that 2018 is destined to be the first year of digital currency for central banks across the world, viewing from the perspectives of supervision, acceptance/criticism and adoption.
The act of questioning the legal status of Bitcoin by big countries such as Russia is actually meant to make way for the official issuance of digital currencies.
On January 8th, the Barcelona new aid Philippe Coutinho showed up for the first time in Camp Nou with his Barcelona shirt, the Xinhua News Agency reported in Madrid by reporter Xie Yuzhi.
Coutinho passed a physical examination of Barcelona early that morning and signed with Barcelona president Bartomeu a contract that will expire in the summer of 2023.
Then he appeared in the face of nearly 7,000 Camp Nou fans as a Barcelona player.
According to a Spanish media, Coutinho's transfer fee may amount to 160 million euros (1 euro≈ 1.77 Chinese yuan), being the highest paid player in the history of Barcelona and La Liga.
As Coutinho is still injured at the moment, he still need recuperate for nearly 20 days before ushering in his debut in the Barcelona shirt.
Is nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.
In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.
But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.
As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.
The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.
Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.
The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.
She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.
Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.
Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.
Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.

World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team
UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.
"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.
"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.
And the guy on the corner street, too.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.
"Eilidh is slightly modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.
Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.
As for my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.
So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."

Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
He chafed at the criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.
"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.
But it matters.
And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.
He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.
The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.
"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Any movement in the property market would have an impact on the sensibilities of the general public.
Purchase quota is a fixed threshold many cities would adopt when implementing real estate control measures.
In May 2017, Jinan issued regulations stating that undergraduates who make social security contributions consecutively for half a year will be entitled to be treated under the same residential property purchase policies as that of local residents with permanent residency.
In June, Wuhan issued policies that stipulate that university students may settle in the city within three years of graduation based on their graduation certificate and employment permit.
After the policy was enhanced, officials stated that “university students are entitled to purchase residential property at a 20% discount to market price”.
In July, Chengdu issue regulations stating that young talent with overseas university bachelor’s degree or higher academic qualifications may apply to settle in Chengdu based on their graduation certificate.
In addition, Kunshan, Lingang in Shanghai, as well as other cities or regions also issued relevant “talent introduction” policies, and lowered the threshold for buying residential property and settling locally for talents.
Zhang Hongwei believed that this was, in fact, large cities competing for population, particularly talent. Only by retaining population, particularly talent, can a city be competitive. This then, was the key significance of these real estate policies.
Some even believed that this implied that the time has come to abolish residential property “purchase quotas”.

Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.
Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.
He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf in.
The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."
Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.
I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.
I'm happy with how it's going so far."
Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free of charge, with car parking charged at £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Zou Shoumin, Director of the Bureau of Environmental Supervision of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, said on the 22nd in Beijing that on a nationwide basis, 57 cases were subject to consecutive daily fines. The newly amended “Environmental Protection Law”, implemented at the beginning of this year, has significantly enhanced environmental law enforcement efforts in China.
Presently, the environmental protection bureaus across China may use various means of punishment to investigate and deal with conduct in violation of environmental regulations such as impose consecutive daily fines, close down operations and/or distrain, limit or suspend production, and persons held under administrative detention. They will also work together with judicial organs to punish environmental crimes.
Zou Shoumin said that in August, a total of 335 cases were concerned with closing close down operations and/or distrain; 177 cases pertained to limiting or suspension of production; 189 cases were concerned with persons held under administrative detention; and 166 cases pertained to persons held under suspicion of environmental pollution crimes.
In particular, Henan imposed consecutive daily fines on seven cases. At present, China is moving from control at the end toward being involved throughout the entire process, intensifying efforts to treat environmental pollution on an all-round basis.
Although pressures from slower economic growth have emerged, China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection had already made its position clear; China should correctly and appropriately position environmental protection in economic growth, and increase “green determination”. The more economic growth decelerates, the more it should hold fast to environmental protection, and ensure that environmental protection plays a positive role in optimizing the economy.
There’s no peak, only higher. The share price of Kweichow Moutai has continued to set new highs unabated.
On January 9, A-share “champion” Kweichow Moutai set another new record high, closing at RMB782.52 for the day. Total market capitalization amounted to RMB983 billion, just a stone’s throw from the RMB1 trillion market capitalization mark.
The guidance price of RMB1,499 was RMB200 higher than the previous retail price of RMB1,299.
On December 28, Kweichow Moutai announced that upon study, it has decided to appropriately hike the price of Moutai liquor products in 2018; on average, the magnitude of the hike would be approximately 18%.
This price hike caused Kweichow Moutai shares to soar. A Beijing Morning Post reporter calculated and found that Kweichow Moutai’s share price had increased by RMB95, or more than 14%, over the eight trading days since the company announced its price hike.
Data showed that the aggregate output value of Guizhou Province for the first to the third quarters of 2017 amounted to RMB950 billion. Maotai’s market capitalization far outstripped Guizhou Province’s GDP for the first three quarters.
Driven by Moutai, listed baijiu companies began to introduce price hikes and control supply, enjoying the dividend brought about by consumption upgrading.
2017 year-to-date, the share prices of most listed baijiu companies have continued to soar. In particular, the share prices of Swellfun, Wuliangye Yibin, Shanxi Xinghuacun Fen Wine, and Kweichow Maotai have at least doubled

High-level foreign talent with Chinese green cards who found technology enterprises may enjoy “citizen treatment”.
The first of the “20 measures to further open up and actively utilize foreign investment” states that China would “support high-level foreign talent who hold permanent residence permits found technology related enterprises”.
Figures from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed that China’s GDP grew 6.9% year-on-year for the first three quarters of 2017, 0.2 percentage points higher than the same period last year. In particular, the growth rates for the first, second and third quarters were 6.9%, 6.9% and 6.8%, respectively. For nine consecutive quarters, GDP growth ranged between 6.7% and 6.9%, maintaining a medium to high rate of growth.

Russian media claimed Putin has a new locally produced vehicle: 15% cheaper than a Mercedes Benz
Reference News January 18 report Russian media claimed that Russia’s Minister of Trade and Industry, Denis Manturov, said that the unit price of the automobiles in President Putin’s “motorcade” is priced at RUB6-7 million or higher.
The budget target is to contain the price at 15% lower than a Mercedes-Benz S class.
Russia Lianta network reported on January 16 that from the end of February to the end of March, the key R&D unit for the President’s automobiles - Central Scientific Research Automobile and Automotive Engines Institute (NAMI) - will deliver 15 automobiles to the Federal Protective Service.
The report states that the “motorcade” project requires manufacturing three types of vehicles - limousine, three-carriage vehicle and a small passenger vehicle - for the nation’s leader using a the same module platform. The budget allocation for this project is RUB12.4 billion.
The report claimed that news of manufacturing the first locally produced limousine in Russia for the President emerged some five years ago. According to the plans of the R&D unit, the new automobile will be equipped with a 800hp engine and armor, and will weigh six tonnes.
It is understood that the engineering and technology team of Germany’s BWM is participating in the R&D of the engine unit.
Elsewhere, according to reports by TASS on January 16, Manturov told reporters that the “motorcade” series of automobiles will be sold externally from 2019. All configured models will be available.
This minister said, “From next year onward, all interested parties may place an order. There are no sale restrictions on any model, whether it is the bullet-proof or the luxury model.”
Russia’s Ministry of Trade and Industry plans to increase the annual production of the “motorcade” series of automobiles to more than 1 million after 2020.
Manturov said, “Manufacturing 18 units puts us at full capacity now. This year’s output is more than 70 units, with 200 units next year, and 300 or even more the year after.”

After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.
An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.
There is no public transport.
The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.
According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people struggle to compete.
"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.
The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.
As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.
"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."
The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.
The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.
Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.
One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.
"I have been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never reappear.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds the discontent.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.
What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically backed the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.
"What else could we do?"
Brands such as Suofeiya, Holike and Topstrong have leveraged the strength of capital to actively grow their business in the customized home furnishing industry. On February 10, 2017, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approved the IPO application of Guangzhou Shangpin Home Collection Co., Ltd., and issued a listing permit on the Small and Medium Enterprise Board of Shenzhen Stock Exchange. More than 20 days ago, Oppein Home Group received approval for its IPO.
Industry insiders believed that with the listings of Shangpin Home Collection and Oppein Home Group, the customized home furnishing sector, which was already soaring, will turn from production competition to competing for capital.
At the beginning of the new year, when Shangpin Home Collection’s IPO was first approved, news of the listing of this classic brand, which represented the customized home furnishing sector, attracted the attention of the entire home furnishing industry.
On the 9th (Beijing time), Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd launched its first set of components for autonomous driving and infotainment solutions it jointly developed with Harman International on Tuesday. This was a major move by the company to expand into the automotive electronics market.
Samsung Electronics acquired Harman International about a year ago.
At the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held in Las Vegas this week, Samsung unveiled its automotive camera equipped with collision warning, lane-departure warning, and adaptive cruise control, which was also developed jointly with Harman.
Samsung plans to begin shipping this camera system, which is built on automatic machine learning and augmented reality technology this year.
Samsung also exhibited a “digital cockpit”, which allows a car to adapt to the personalized characteristics of the driver even if he or she is not the car owner by accessing the user’s information from mobile devices and cloud.
The 20th round of CBA regular season will begin tonight, which also means the start of the second half of CBA league in 2016~2017 season.
Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.
It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.
The Williams team also suggested that Massa might return, even though he had already announced his retirement.
January 9 is just a month away from the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. As the Olympic torch relay moves north, warm-ups and intense preparations for the Games were carried out. South Korea was warming up for the Winter Olympics.
Public opinion in South Korea hope that this long-waited North-South Dialog would lead to an “Easter egg” (nice surprise) for the countdown to the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games.
The Winter Olympic torch arrived in South Korea on November 1 last year.
The fervor stirred up by the Olympic torch is directly reflected on the sale of admission tickets for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.
A little over two months ago, the proportion of tickets sold lingered at 32% for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, and a mere 4.3% for the Winter Paralympics. The sluggish ticket sales caused concern among the outside world about the popularity of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics at one point.
However, just as the Chairman of the PyeongChang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games, Lee Hee-Beom predicted, “As the Winter Olympic torch is carried and passed on across South Korea, interest in the Winter Olympics will rise. I believe that ticket sales will turn around very quickly”.
South Korean media reported that as of January 3, the proportion of tickets sold for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics has reached 64%, and that for the Paralympics has also exceeded 50%.
To encourage foreigners to come to watch the Games, South Korea’s Ministry of Justice has also announced on the 8th that foreigners who visit the country for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics may extend their stay for up to 120 days.
More than 1 in 5 US travellers carry prohibited items onto aircraft, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.
The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.
As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions
One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.
At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.
"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."

Since the second half of 2009, sales (volume) of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs have remained relatively buoyant. This Spring in particular, sales of Xiaoshan’s seedlings recorded a historic high. Sales volume grew significantly and prices jumped. Statistics revealed that for the first six months of the year, the sales revenue of seedlings in the Xiaoshan District increased by 48% year-on-year, and the magnitude of the growth rate was the biggest in nearly 20 years.
Shi Haiyong, Deputy Director of the Xiaoshan Forestry Bureau, said that the production of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs also grown rapidly along with the positive sales trend.
In the last two years, the planting acreage of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs have expanded by 30,000 mu, with total area at 180,000 mu. At the same time, expansion is being actively carried out outside the region. Xiaoshan’s farmers have been setting up flowering tree and shrub bases totaling 80,000 mu across the country, an increase of 30,000 mu from that in 2008.
While expanding planting acreage, the quality of the seedlings have also continued to improve; the existing value of the nurseries has been rising. More large specimen and high quality seedlings have been preserved, and sellers have been reluctant to sell some seedlings.
Shi Haiyong also said that confronted with the current buoyant peak production and sales period, producers should calmly face and objectively analyze the situation, and take into consideration that the demand for flowering trees and shrubs is long term and will continue to increase. At the same time, they should also be aware that market competition will intensify.
July 13 morning Beijing Time. US-based Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas accusing Apple of infringing on a battery technology patent it applied for in 2010.
The company had previously used the same patent to sue Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.
The lawsuit claimed that iPhone 6s and Apple equipment similar to it have violated US Patent No. 7,657,386, which is known as “Integrated battery service system”.
The plaintiff is seeking monetary damages or royalties on the infringing equipment upon announcement of the verdict.
According to the indictment, the plaintiff appears to believe that iPhone’s fast-charging technology jas violated the former’s patent.
iPhone’s fast-charging function charges the battery quickly until to 80% of its capacity, then switches to slower trickle charging.
Somaltus is actually a so-called “patent troll” because the company does not provide any apparent product or service, and it is hard to find any information on the company online.
However, it has successfully reached out-of-court settlement with auto makers such as Ford and Nissan with this patent.
The meeting believed that accelerating information development; promoting interconnection and integration, as well as efficient utilization of resources; and enhancing the level of digitization and intelligence in industry would have great significance for advancing “Made in China 2025”; entrepreneurship and innovation by the masses; developing new drivers; and raising the standard of living for the masses.

Trump pressured Mexico on border wall payment according to leaked phone call transcripts
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
On 27th January in a phone call to Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him "You cannot say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call all day."

The report analyzed the results of a survey of 1,045 foreign tourists who visited Seoul in December last year.
The report indicated that the per capita spending for shopping by foreign tourists amounted to KRW1.06 million.
In particular, the per capita spending for shopping by Chinese tourists, at KRW2.13 million, was the highest; this was 6.5 times that of Japanese tourists and 3.2 times that of American and European tourists.
With respect to the purpose for visiting Seoul, the answer from 62.2% of Chinese tourists was “shopping”; 94.4% of Chinese tourists purchased cosmetics.
96.3% of Chinese tourists shopped at urban duty-free shops, with per capita spending at KRW1.56 million.

Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.
"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.
"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.
But not one was ever prosecuted.
Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.
Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.
Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.
"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks put it more succinctly.
"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.
Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.
"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said n---a, get off my property!"
Rascona fires back.
There's a beat.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
He's alarmed, confused.
Did I go too hard?
"No," Greene said through chuckles.
"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"
"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.
"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"
And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.
Absolutely no one laughs.
The reenactment ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks on every other word.
A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.
They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted.
As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.
Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.
"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.
He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.
"The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment," he said.
"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.
Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
As regards implementing market-oriented reforms associated with natural gas, the importance of reform with respect to “pipeline and grid independence” is self-evident, but more resistance and controversy can be expected.
On the 7th, reporters learned from Kailuan (Group) that at 11:25 am on the 7th, an explosion occurred at the emulsifying workshop of Kailuan (Group) Chemical Co., Ltd. which is located at Guye District of Tangshan, Hebei Province; 13 operators were trapped at the site of the explosion.
To date, of the 13 people trapped, one has been rescued, and rushed to the hospital for immediate medical treatment, while emergency rescue operations are still ongoing for the other 12.
It is understood that the scene of the explosion has been sealed. The local public security, firefighting, medical and other departments are carrying out rescue operations at the scene at this time.
Eye witnesses said that there was a loud bang when the explosion occurred, and a mushroom cloud rose instantly.
According to the staff of Kailuan (Group) who were organizing the rescue effort at the scene, Tangshan Kailuan (Group) Chemical Co., Ltd., located at Northern Zhaoge Village, Guye District, Tangshan, Hebei Province, is a State approved designated enterprise that produces explosives for civilian use. It was established in 1958, and was formerly known as Kailuan Mining Bureau Factory 602.
(Reporter: Cui Wei) Since he made his debut 15 years ago, Jay Chou would release a new album every year, but surprisingly, he failed to do so last year.
His fans did not protest however; instead, they sent their blessings because the reason Jay Chou failed to release a new album was because he became a father.
After waiting for a year and a half, Jay Chou finally arrived in Beijing to present his first works since becoming a father. It was also the 14th album in his music career, “Jay Chou’s Bedtime Stories”.
US media: Scientists from the Air Force Engineering University of China looking into laser satellite to clean up space debris
Reference News January 18 report US media claims that Chinese scientists have put forward a daring and innovation proposal - to use large lasers to clean up the messy Earth orbit, and destroy old satellites as well as other space debris.
A January 15 report on US “Newsweek” website stated that researchers at the Air Force Engineering University of China have written a thesis on “Research on de-orbiting model of small scale space debris removal using space-based laser”. This thesis described how by using space-based platform lasers, space debris would be rendered smaller and less dangerous as a result of laser radiation.
The report claimed that for years, space debris has always been a matter of concern for international space agencies. NASA has considered many alternative plans to track, probe and remove human made debris.
The methods for cleaning up large space debris include using an enormous net to clean up and collect the debris, as well as using magnetic material to suck them out of the orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted a laser simulation study and arrived at the following conclusion. This will be an effective method for cleaning up the Earth’s orbit.
The abstract of the thesis claimed that “(the simulated study) has provided the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal by using space-based laser.”
A 2014 research conducted by US defense industry giant Lockheed Martin revealed that as far as orbiting satellites are concerned, approximately 200 deterrents exist daily.
The high-speed debris of orbiting satellites are regarded as serious threats to future space missions, and have been described by European Space Agency experts as a “series of fatal threats”. High-speed debris has continued to rise annually over the years.
According to a January 17 report on the US-based “Popular Mechanics” website, space is basically empty, but space around Earth has become increasingly crowded. Every satellite we send into space will ultimately become debris orbiting Earth. As time passes, these debris will accumulate.
As debris increase, the probability of a satellite that is still operating normally being hit by debris becomes higher, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of US dollars.
The report claimed that all space agencies have formulated plans to remove space debris in the future.
NASA is considering firing atmospheric gases to reduce the speed of the debris so that it would de-orbit. Europe is looking at launching a satellite with a large net to capture the debris and it back to earth. Japan’s idea is to use a power chain to capture the debris.
At this time, China has also put forward a method of solving the space debris problem, and that is, to use a large laser to shrink the floating space debris into smaller, less harmful pieces.
According to a thesis published in German magazine “Optics”, a group of researchers at the Air Force Engineering University of China claimed that installing such a laser on a satellite would be enough to effectively clean up space; at least, according to the simulated results, that is.
The report claimed that the only way to prove effectiveness is to carry out tests. Currently, there are no arrangements for such as mission, but sooner or later, someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space.
Once this is achieved, we can finally bid farewell to space debris problems for good.

Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business.
The job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394-million U.S.) in May in a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the year was unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.05 billion pounds.
A few days ago, the China Athletic Association issued a serious notice to severely beat the phenomenon of running for others, and prepared to punish violators with a lifelong ban.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.
On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."
The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.
But the efforts have triggered pushback by Democratics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
Best of luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.
"We're the main names.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ... ."
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.
But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.
They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.
"This is the fight to be made.
No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.
I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.
Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight."

The position stated by National Development and Reform Commission officials as regards achieving the emission reduction target of the 11th Five-Year Plan ahead of time gives the steel industry, which has been subjected to power supply and production quotas, strong expectations of resumption of production.
Although steel plants, as of now, have yet to receive clear notification from local governments announcing that work related to energy conservation and emission reduction has ended, the industry expects that by around December 15, 2010, steel plants nationwide that have been subjected to production quotas will resume production successively. Steel prices could start to come under pressure.
A spokesperson from a private steel enterprise in Hebei told our reporter that notice to end power supply and production quotas has yet to be received at this time, but in reality, pressure on all enterprises have eased significantly when compared to that in September and October.
Some local governments in Hebei Province have repeatedly issued documents related to power supply and production quotas, and have adopted mandatory power shutdown measures to limit production.
The reporter learned from local enterprises that the steel plants of most regions in Hebei have resumed production at this time, and pressure from production quotas have eased.
Mysteel.com analyst Zhang Tieshan estimated that end-user demand for construction steel will gradually weaken as winter has already arrived in Northern China.
Coupled with the energy conservation and emission reduction program winds down, most steel plants will generally resume production by around December 15. Products will gradually make their way to markets across the country before New Year’s Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will exert some pressure on soaring steel prices.

“American Crime Story” won the major awards for the limited series, movie or dramatic special category, while “Game of Thrones” won 12 major awards (including the technical category); in particular, it won three major awards, namely, Best Drama Series, Best Directing for a Drama Series, and Best Writing for a Drama Series.
To date, “Game of Thrones” has already received 38 Emmy Awards, becoming the TV series that has won the most Emmy Awards in history.
Regrettably, none of the actors in “Game of Thrones” won an award.
A few years ago, people who were allowed to set foot in the venture capital sector were limited to those who had founded companies and subsequently joined venture capital companies, or analysts who worked in venture capital companies who hoped to further their careers.
Entrepreneurs would be able to more easily raise funds from the numerous investors on the AngelList, and would therefore not have to rely on on agents to put them in contact with top venture capital companies.
CRI Online (Liu Pai): The Economic & Commercial Section of the Embassy of the Republic of Italy in China held a Sino-Italian Cooperation Program for Environmental Protection on the 18th. Participants from corporations and scientific research institutions of the two countries had an extensive exchange of views in respect of cooperation between the two countries as regards renewable resources under a new state of affairs, and reached a consensus.
It is understood that the participating Chinese representatives mainly comprised those from China Recycling Development Corporation Ltd and International Technology Transfer Network, while the Italian representatives included those from the Global Energy Environmental Exchange Organization, federation of businesses of the greater Bologna region, and other entities.
The Italian representatives said that Italy has a myriad of environmental protection technologies and solutions in the renewable resources sector, and proposed to carry out pilot programs with the Chinese in three areas, namely, industrial waste treatment, waste oil treatment, and waste incineration and disposal. It also looked forward to promoting its environmental protection partnership experience with China in other regions around the world.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.
Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.
They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.
To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."
When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.
One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.
The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."
West Virginia governor announces he's switching parties
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.
"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to run another play."
Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.

Tencent Financial News on January 18, the USD-to-RMB middle prices is registered at 6.4401, a depreciation of 66 basis points compared with the last trading day, ending the rise spanning five consecutive days.
In the overnight market, the US dollar experienced a V-shaped rebounded, ending at 90.8900 as of 07:30, Beijing time.
The Beige Book published by Federal Reserve shows that almost all 12 Fed regions reported mild to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018. The Federal Reserve remains optimistic about the outlook for this year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. unemployment rate remained at 4.1% in December, the lowest since 2000, and companies are expected to increase wages in the coming months.
Fed officials generally believe that tax reform is a factor supporting this modest strengthening of the economic outlook. The Fed predicts that the economy will increase by 2.5% in 2018 and the interest rate will be raised three times.
Some market observers have point out that the expected tightening of ECB’s monetary policy pushes up the exchange rate of the Euro in recent days. As a result, the US dollar index declines continuously, and the RMB exchange rate against the US dollar has seen a surge in prices. However, the European Central Bank is unlikely to adjust the policy stance soon. After the short-term fluctuation of the foreign exchange market, the exchange rates will eventually return to a level dictated by the fundamentals, and the continued smooth operation of the RMB exchange rate is a high probability event.
It is worth noting that, as the market expects a more stable renminbi, the attractiveness of renminbi assets to foreign investors will also gradually increase.
The People’s Bank of China has authorized the China Foreign Exchange Trade System to release the interbank foreign exchange market central parity rates of the RMB: USD1 to RMB6.4401, EUR1 to RMB7.8482, JPY100 to RMB5.7854, HKD1 to RMB0.82399, GBP1 to RMB8.9017, AUD1 to RMB5.1302, NZD1 to RMB4.6779, SGD 1 to RMB4.8546, CHF1 to RMB6.6731, CAD1 to RMB5.1747, RMB1 to MYR 0.61399, RMB1 to RUB8.8352, RMB1 to ZAR1.9128, RMB1 to KRW165.95, RMB1 to AED0.57030, RMB1 to SAR0.58233, RMB1 to HUF39.3106, RMB1 to PLN0.53093, RMB1 to DKK0.9487, RMB1 to SEK1.2501, RMB1 to NOK1.2240, RMB1 to TRY0.59303, RMB1 to MXN2.9071.

It was a fairly typical Taiwanese telecommunication network scam.
How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.
Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.
Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."
Smart interactive robot developer Rokid received new investment; Temasek is the lead investor
In recent years, start-ups in the AI sector have continued to be a hot favorite of capital.
AI Rokid recently completed a round of funding, led by Temasek. Other investors included Credit Suisse, CDIB (the investment arm of China Development Financial Holdings Co., Ltd.), and existing shareholder IDG Capital.
It is understood that the size of this round of funding was approximately US$100 million. Both Credit Suisse and CDIB were first time investors in China’s domestic AI industry.
Rokid is a developer of smart interactive robots, and is committed to robotics research. It products can control smart devices in the home, and has continuous autonomous learning and growth functions. It also features recognition, comprehension and feedback functions.
Proceeds from this round of funding will be used for R&D, talent recruitment, strategic push and industry chain investment layout.
Rokid previously raised US$8.3 million in August 2014 in the Angel Round from IDG, Linear Venture, Mfund and Vision Capital. In October 2014, the company again received at least US$10 million in Series A funding led by Walden International, with the Angel investors as participants. On November 1, 2016, Rokid completed Series B funding, led by Advantech Capital; other investors included IDG, Mfund, Vision Capital and Walden International.
At the time, Rokid claimed that after the Series B funding, the company’s valuation would reach US$450 million.
In May 2017, Rokid unveiled its consumer class smart voice robot “Rokid - Pebble”, integrating AI and the home, priced at RMB1,399.
This robot uses speech synthesis, natural language understanding, speech recognition technology and microphone array technology, with conversational, music broadcast and smart home features.
It has won two major CES awards - Tech For A Better World and Home Audio/Video Components And Accessories, as well as Germany’s iF Design Award, known as the Oscars of the design world.
At the 2018 CES which had just ended, Rokid unveiled another new product: the consumer class augmented reality AR glasses RokidGlass.
These glasses are used as independent head displays, and do not require connections to smartphones or external computers. It is expected to be commercialized in 2018.
Previously, the company had already released its first generation home robot, RokidAlien and second generation product, smart voice box RokidPebble.

“Tofu”, a 3D animated feature film designed for a general audience held its premiere in Wuhan on the 25th. Zou Yi, Director of “Tofu”, Meng Zhihui, Animation Director of “Tofu”, as well as Tom Disher, film soundtrack composer and Emmy Award winner were present to share their behind-the-scenes story of the film’s creation.
“Tofu” is based on a traditional allusion concerning Liu An, Prince of Huainan in the Han Dynasty - “Liu An made a mistake and invented tofu”. It is an account of “Dou Fu”, the leading character, a bean who miraculously took on human form, how he overcame numerous difficulties and persevered in his dream to become an immortal. This adorable animated film about becoming an immortal is closely connected with Hubei’s local culture.
Wudang Mountains, located in Shiyan, Hubei Province, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as the place of origin of Toaist culture and Wudang martial arts. It is known as “a unique scenic spot since ancient times, and the premier celestial mountain in the world”.
Director Zou Yi revealed that he and his creative team traveled to Wudang Mountains to conduct research for the film prior to its creation.
He said that the story of “Tofu” occurred during the reign of Emperor Wu of Western Han Dynasty, against the backdrop of Liu An, Prince of Huainan, making pills to attain immortality. The leading character “Dou Fu” was a bean that miraculously took on human form by accident while Liu An was making these pills.
In addition to Wudang Mountains, the place of origin of Toaist culture, Hubei Province is also closely connected with the chime - a traditional musical instrument with long history in China.

Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.
But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.
It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.
It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).
And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.
The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.
Reporters learned from recent interviews that the performance of the steel, rail transport, shipping vessel, machinery manufacture and other industries has fallen in general; some have even incurred losses.
Some experts believed that under the present circumstances, a new round of revitalization of the industries in Northeast China will not only concern the nation’s current economic recovery, it will also have an impact on the long-term growth and international competitiveness of China's manufacturing sector. Hence, there is an urgent call for adjustments and structural transformation to take place.
Traditional industries saw a general decline in performance, and even incurred losses. The raw material industry, and the heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing sector saw performance decline significantly, and even incurred losses. These were the first signs from the industries in Northeast China amid the current sluggish economy.
When the economy decelerated in the past, low-end and primary commodities were the most significantly affected. In the current economic fluctuation however, both high- and low-end industrial products of Northeast China’s traditional industries were affected.
A few years ago, Ansteel Group (Weibo) began by adjusting its product mix, and gave priority to developing high-end steel plates such as those for containers, railroad tracks, shipbuilding, and civilian home appliances. However, sales of these product categories fell significantly. In particular, the sales volume of steel plates for shipbuilding plunged 50% year-on-year.
Angang Steel Company (Hao Qingshun, Director of the Metallurgical Department of Liaoning Provincial Industry and Informatization Commission, said that metallurgy was the third largest pillar industry in Liaoning, with annual steel production capacity of 60 million tonnes, ranked third nationwide.
For the first five months of this year, crude steel production in Liaoning Province amounted to 21.54 million tonnes. Sales of products required by projects that were encouraged by national policy and where there was strong local government construction activity was better. Products in which market competition was more intense fell by a larger magnitude. This was another characteristic of Northeast China’s manufacturing sector.
In sharp contrast to being diligent and responsible on reaching adulthood, Daniel Wu was a very mischievous child, even rebellious.
The movie “Once Upon a Time”, soon to be released on August 4, held a press conference entitled “people from all corners of the world have come to meet you” to launch the movie in Beijing yesterday. On-screen “Bai Ye couple” Yang Yang (Ye) and Liu Yifei (Bai) were present at the conference.
Yang Yang, who underwent surgery on his right ear just a few days ago, made an appearance for the first time after his recuperation. He interpreted his character as someone who “does not wear his heart on his sleeve”, quietly giving his all to Bai Qian, and concealing all his feelings.
Yang Yang said that he had to rouse all his emotions to convey the character’s hidden sadness to the audience. “This was certainly a new challenge for me as an actor. While acting this character, I was so emotionally suppressed that I almost suffered internal injury”.
Liu Yifei, meanwhile, revealed that while acting her character in the movie, she cried so much that she collapsed at one point.
The Japanese Olympic Committee recently said that the Japanese delegation was targeted at 30 gold medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and making Japan into the Top Three.
In October last year, Chairman Yamashita Tasuhiro of the Athletes Commission of Japanese Olympic Committee expressed his expectation that the Japanese athletes can win 2.5 times more gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics than at the Rio Olympics.
At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Japanese delegation ranked 6th in the Gold List with 12 gold medals.
The representatives formed their own groupings, and walked to the venue holding umbrellas.
Traffic on the roads surrounding the venue remained normal. There were no balloons or slogans at the venue, nor a red carpet; displays of plants and fresh flowers were absent as well.
Yesterday, the second session of the fourth People’s Congress of Guang’an City convened without much ado.
On entering GuangAn International Convention and Exhibition Center, slogans were absent from the venue, and there were no tea cups; not even a bottle of mineral water was present.
Instead, there a simple banner, a meeting place, a simple recyclable paper document bag containing materials for the meeting and a recyclable paper cup for tea or water.
The meeting materials were less dense than that of the past. A few pieces of paper summarized the theme and the agenda of the meeting.
“Be thrifty for the people. Those whose duty are to be frugal must live frugally. A return to the current simple and down-to-earth meeting environment, we fully comprehend and welcome it.” GuangAn People’s Congress deputy Wang Cheng said that an efficient and practical meeting without formalism is what they want to see and in which they want to participate.
Experts pointed out that both inflationary and deflationary pressures have eased at this time. This was undoubtedly good news for the financial and economic structural transformation stage.
A total of 22 models of electric vehicles are sold at all major car dealers in California, but the selection in other states is a lot more limited. The second placed state only has 14 models while six states do not have any electric vehicles on sale.
February 10 news: Reporters learned yesterday from Changzhou Municipal Agricultural Committee that on basis of having successfully become a national forest city in 2016, Changzhou will thoroughly implement the “Master Plan for Establishing Changzhou National Forest City, Jiangsu Province (2014-2025)” this year so as to consolidate and upgrade the achievements from establishing a national forest city, and build a green, harmonious and high quality forest city that may be shared and enjoyed by all.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.
The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.
It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.
In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.
Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.
It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.
The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.
The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."
China Earthquake Networks Center officially determined that a magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck New Zealand on November 13 at 19:02 (42.53 degrees south latitude, 173.05 degrees east longitude), with the epicenter 10km deep. Powerful tremors were felt in the capital, Wellington.
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000
Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.
Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.
Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.
The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'

Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.
"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."
Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.
It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.
The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.
Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.
What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.
"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.
These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."
It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.

The Ministry of Land and Resources as well as other relevant departments must take the initiative to serve, consider the overall situation associated with the structural transformation and integrated reform experimental zone program, and actively strive for policy support from the State.
July 26 news: On July 22, reporters learned from Hongqiao District that the upgrading project of the city’s largest downtown riverside linear park has been completed, and the park will be opened to the public free of charge.
The entire landscaped zone leveraged the existing natural ecology as well as the strengths of historical and cultural resources, and re-planning as well as upgrading and transformation was carried out on both banks of the South Grand Canal. Five riverside scenic spots along the river were created, namely, “Emperor Yongle’s Ferry Crossing Heritage Park”, “Wellington Plaza”, “Xintiandi Folk Street”, “Tianjin West Railway Station Gallery” and “Shuixi Artistic Heritage Green Corridor”.
Plastic paved pathways of approximately 1,500 meters with distance markers have been built in the green open space on both sides of the river bank between Jinhua Bridge and Xinsantiao Stone Bridge.
In addition to the flowers, plants and trees planted on both sides of the pathway, a children’s playground has been constructed, embellished with various groups of small sculptures.
As you walk along, you will see benches, paved pathways, bridges, riverside decks, sand pits for children to play in, and other amenities. These help integrate the green landscape and water sights into one, offering residents another place for leisure, fitness and entertainment.
Yesterday, a list of 23 players to participate in the China Cup was released by Chinese national coach Lippi, and caused great controversy in the society.

A reason for poor electric vehicle sales is inadequate promotional effort for these products.

Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.
Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.
Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.
A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.
Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.
"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.
"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."
On Friday, that hope appeared gone.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.
Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.
Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.
This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.
That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.
No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How'd that work out?
Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.
Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Tourism charm town: How does charm mesmerize tourists
[Abstract] The potential of small towns in Zhejiang is gradually unleashed.
Today, these little towns have become key destinations for visitors to Zhejiang who come to admire the natural scenery, savor Zhejiang culture, and feel nostalgic about Zhejiang. They will also become key drivers to help the Province create “Picturesque Zhejiang”, China’s most beautiful tourist destination.
Reputed for Local Custom
"Village theatrical performance is staged as the moon rises, while the pleasant smell of delicious sausage spreads with breeze."
Walking through the Anchang Ancient Town in Shaoxing, you can see hoop buckets, bamboo knitting, ironmaking, shoes stitching, lace making, cotton spinning and other traditional handicraft techniques almost everywhere, which fully represent the intangible cultural heritage of the Anchang Ancient Town. Tourists all over the world are enchanted to experience the folk customs and feel the atmosphere of Shaoxing's historical and cultural experience.
It is reported that during the three-day New Year's holiday, more than 65,000 tourists visit Anchang Ancient Town.
In Zhejiang, a town with a unique style such as Anchang Ancient Town is scattered all over like stars. The glittering waves of Jiaxing Xitang is flowing with the warmth and gratefulness of the lower reaches of the Yangze River in the south; the white walls of Quzhou's Nianbadu Ancient Town convey to us the changes over time in the town; and the murals of fishermen in Shitang, Taizhou draw a picture of their life, both traditional and modern. These towns are the "palm treasure" of Zhejiang tourism and also the favorites of tourists from all regions.
In recent years, with the promotion of tourism construction throughout the whole region, the potential of Zhejiang’s small towns have been gradually awakened.
In 2016, the provincial government office issued the "The implementation of the creation of a tourist town in Zhejiang Province”, which proposed that the province would accept and name about 100 tourist towns with strong folk customs, beautiful ecological environment and rich tourism industries after 5 years or so.
Today, these little towns have become key destinations for visitors to Zhejiang who come to admire the natural scenery, savor Zhejiang culture, and feel nostalgic about Zhejiang. They will also become key drivers to help the Province create “Picturesque Zhejiang”, China’s most beautiful tourist destination.
The responsible people of the Provincial Tourism Bureau established that with the rise of these tourism style towns, we must now pay more attention to the construction of the personalized tourism industry and new tourism projects and formats emerging one after another. These have brought rich experiences to tourists and earned glowing reputations.
Emphasis on promotion
Recently, directed by the Zhejiang Provincial Tourism Bureau and Zhejiang Daily Press Group, the Tourism Full Media Center of the Zhejiang Daily Press Group hosted the “Towns × Future artists" sharing session and the 2017 promotion season of Zhejiang style tourism towns, "Poetic Zhejiang, Towns with folk customs”. The closing ceremony took place in the Zhejiang exhibition hall.
“A style town has artistic beauty and living warmth.
The style of the towns lies in the original sense, flavor and township, which represents the original purity.
Xie Hanfeng, a teacher at the School of Film and Television Animation Arts of China’s Academy of Art, the domestic A-list film and television advertising director, and Professor Xu Xianghong, the dean of the School of Art and Communication at China Jiliang University, talked about the cross-border stories of towns through Towns in the lens and Reconstruction of small village.
Many scenic tourist towns in Zhejiang have deep cultural resources. Dong Xinjian, a town deputy from Nanxun, Huzhou, appeared in the site in person and interpreted Nanxun as a traditional Chinese painting.
The style of towns in the south of the lower reaches of the Yangze River have been popular with painters since ancient times. Nowadays, the Nanxun Ancient Town is developing in-depth cooperation with art academies such as the China Academy of Art.
Tourism style towns must be equipped with elements of style, tourism, service and the environment.
Among these, tourism service facilities and the environment are very important.
If the tourists are handed in an umbrella on a rainy day, they can better experience the town’s style.
In the era of sharing, the Tourism Full Media Center of the Zhejiang Daily Press Group teamed up with the hottest shared umbrella company to customize a number of shared umbrellas in “Poetic Zhejiang” style, hoping to promote the concept of “Sharing and Green”, spread the awareness of civilized tourism and public morality among tourists and residents, and create a shared, beautiful tourist environment.
This has become a bright spot in the 2017 promotional season of Zhejiang’s tourism towns, "Poetic Zhejiang, Towns with folk customs”.
Expecting wonders
Up to now, Zhejiang Province has released the list of the first 21 provincial-level tourism towns that will ultimately culminate in a grand total of 115 provincial tourism towns.
As the prior area for the development of rural tourism during the “13th Five-Year Plan” period, the style towns will eventually be built into tourist attractions with a grade of 3A or higher, becoming a new model for tourism product diversity, tourism benefits and industrial integration.
What makes tourism style towns attractive is their authenticity and originality.
The beauty of the tourism style towns not only stems from the misty bridges and rivers, but also from a long history of cultural tradition; the revitalization of the country is due to cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the world, the tulips of the Netherlands’ Lisse Town, the salt of Austria’s Hallstatt Town, and the pumpkins of Pumpkin Town in France, have been attracting a large number of tourists from all over the world each year. This has allowed the realization that tourism could help the economic growth of smalls towns as well.
For the style towns, the point “Emphasis on characteristics and retention of nostalgia” has given the towns a distinct personality and soul, further providing cultural permeation, carrying local cultural traditions, and highlighting native civilizations.
Tourism style towns, with culture and nostalgia as the link and humanities and scenery as the carrier, connect tourists all over the world while inherit and innovate the traditional customs and cultures in the co-construction and sharing process.
Essentially speaking, the tourism style town is a complex open-style tourism area, and it should be a shared living space for local residents, exotic tourists and even sojourners.
As the main battlefield for tourism growth in the future, tourism style towns will change the rural ecological landscape, economic and social development patterns, and the flow direction of industrial factors. Additionally, they will play an important role in eliminating the urban-rural infrastructure gap, hastening rural cultural recovery.
In the wake of accelerating revitalization of the countryside, Zhejiang tourist towns will receive a more abundant and wonderful story.
Figures indicate that 70% of China’s travel demand is concentrated within a 3km radius. On this basis, the short-distance travel market will become a bike sharing paradise sooner or later.
A report in “The Nikkei” claimed that inflationary pressure will increase because of the expansionary fiscal policies of the next Trump administration. The pace of interest rate hikes will also accelerate in 2017.
The annual International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), held between January 9 (January 10, Beijing time) and 12, opened in Las Vegas, USA.
According to the list of exhibitors published by the official CES website, the 51st CES attracted 4,577 corporate participants from around the world.
Compared to the massive 13,000 TV dramas broadcast by satellite TV each year, these “terminated dramas” are but a drop in the ocean.
Travellers negotiate trench, return to 'Millionaire's row'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.
Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.
Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.
The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.'
She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'
One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'

Xinhua News Agency/Chen Yehua/CRI Online: The Fifth Session of the 12th National People's Congress held its closing ceremony at the Great Hall of the People at 9am on March 15.
Prior to the closing ceremony, Ma Junsheng, Director-General of the State Post Bureau, expressed during an interview at the “ministers’ passage” that the State will strengthen supervision over prominent issues that currently exist in the express delivery industry such as late delivery and loss of or damaged parcels, and guide and enhance self-discipline in the industry.
Ma Junsheng said that efforts to resolve four major prominent issues in the express delivery industry will be enhanced this year. The development of the express delivery industry in China has entered the express lane.
In 2012, express delivery volume in China stood at 5.6 billion items, and at least 10,000 express delivery three-wheelers were deployed. A single standard, a unique logo and a unified insurance were implemented, which facilitated delivery and ensured safety.

Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.
Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Lian Ping, Chief Economist of the Bank of Communications, said that as value added of industry for each of the first three quarters of 2017 was stronger toward the end of the quarter, the growth rate of value added of industry in December could accelerate to 6.6%.
Cumulative growth rate of fixed asset investment in December is forecast to be at 7.2%, unchanged from the previous month, but lower than that a year ago.
Industrial production, while weaker than that in October, will remain generally unchanged from that in November.
Investment in China’s manufacturing sector was low in December, but infrastructure investment improved slightly. As such, fixed asset investment for the month will remain the same as that in November.

Beijing’s new measure to “shift and relocate institutions of higher learning”: 10,000 BUCT teachers and students move into new campus at Changping
The opening ceremony of Beijing University of Chemical Technology’s (BUCT) new campus was held at the Changping District of Beijing on the 2nd, and school officially commenced at the 1,800 mu green campus.
Reporters learned from the ceremony that for the purposes of enhancing the capital’s core functions, and treating “large urban center diseases”, on the back of cooperative development among Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province as well as the shifting and relocation of non-capital related functions, Beijing has accelerated the program to shift and relocate institutions of higher learning situated in central districts to suburban districts in recent years. The teachers and students of some institutions of higher learning are relocating in batches to new campuses in Shunyi, Daxing, Fangshang and other suburban districts.
BUCT’s new campus is located in Nankou Town, Changping, and sits on a land area of 1,800 mu, some 40 km from the city. It is a key project of Beijing’s shifting and relocation of non-capital functions.
The new campus was constructed in three phases. Phase I is now entirely completely, and Phase II is expected to commence by the end of the year. On completion, the learning and living requirements of close to 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students as well as faculty staff are expected to be met.
At this time, a review of this year’s film market will show that fans of the original book of a film adaptation and those of the actors taking part in film have become key components of the expected audience of the film.
At 17:10 today, the 119 command center at Shaoyang received an emergency call. Tetrahydrofuran stored at Hongzhi Chemical Plant at Longxutang, Shuangxi District, caught fire.
Shaoyang fire station immediately dispatched five detachments and 20 fire trucks with heavy chemical protective clothing, chemical cleaning vehicles and other equipment to the scene.
Preliminary investigation revealed that the cause of the fire was the small tanks in which tetrahydrofuran was stored. There was thick smoke at the scene.
At the time of filing this report, firefighters were in the processing of carrying out emergency rescue. The City’s health, safety administration, environmental protection, public security, traffic and other departments arrived at the scene successively. No fatalities or injured persons were found.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to better her own.
She has not accepted responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Zhang Yimou is destined to controversial film artist. From when he began filming his first movie, “Red Sorghum”, he has always been a trendsetter in Chinese films, but he has also received a lot of criticism.
On the 2nd, reporters learned from Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club that the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth Team came in fourth at the National Youth Basketball League Finals held in Beijing.
Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth Team is comprised of 11 local basketball players, and its head coach is Tsering Samdup, the assistant coach of the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Men’s Team.

The players’ self-confidence and grasp of the game have increased significantly. Their exchanges with other teams were also more comprehensive, and exchanges both on and off the court have also increased and were more relaxed.
After the competition ended, captain Jiang Cuo said that he hoped to gain experience from taking part in the competition, and do his best for Tibetan basketball.
It is understood that during the competition, the players had to overcome factors such as low altitude sickness, displaying the image of Tibet.
The fact that track and field involves the most gold medals in the Olympics makes those athletes confident a lot, the famous players have been disadvantaged in the competition.
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the moves as recalls.
European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.
The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.
Taking a couple of years, or even a few years, to make a film from planning to release is nothing unusual.
“Big Fish & Begonia”, an animated feature film 12 years in the making, recently announced that it would be released on July 8th.
Liang Xuan, the author of “Big Fish & Begonia”, dropped out of his studies at the Department of Thermal Engineering at Tsinghua University when he was 21, and founded B&T together with best friend Zhang Chun. In 2008, Ce Yuan Ventures provided US$1 million in risk investment, kick-starting the maiden animated film, “Big Fish & Begonia”.
The film was already a recipient of multiple local and overseas awards at the creative sample stage. It has been included in the Centre Pompidou’s collection and acclaimed as “an outstanding artwork”.
As it took six years from creation to production, the film was known as a “super deceiver” by millions of fans who were looking forward to its release.
“Big Fish & Begonia” is a Chinese fantasy. The announcement of the trailers for the scheduled release has once again led to new expectations among all viewers.
Liang Xuan said, “I’ve only done this one thing in the last 12 years. Now it has turned from a dream into reality. I’m both nervous and excited”.
Zhang Chun said, “I kept thinking of using one-fiftieth of other people’s budget to come up with an image effect that was completely identical to these other people’s. I drove our entire team up the wall.”
Dongguan, the “Factory of the World” which once made its fortune on industrial processing and large numbers of general workers, is looking to high-level talent to help the city reposition itself.
The Dongguan government recently held a high-level talent week event. Reporters from China Business Network noticed a number of reputable local enterprises participating in the talent fair.
On the bright advertising board against a tangerine colored wall, they listed their respective exorbitant price tags.
Therefore, China Television Drama Production Industry Association will work together with the television drama production industry nationwide to sign a self-discipline convention.
Provence lavender under threat from climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."
And a lot is at stake.
As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.
Compared to the sci-fi elements in the movie, the two lead actors said that it was the movie’s plot that attracted them.
On the afternoon of September 5, West China City Daily reporters consecutively interviewed numerous renowned personalities in the cross talk circle, as well as two cross talk artistes. What was surprising was that they were unanimously silent most of the time.
One is a Silver Bear Best Actor, the other, an up-and-coming young actor; “Guilty of Mind” is the first partnership between Liao Fan and Li Yifeng.
A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.
It's important to change their routines, they are told.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.
Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.
His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.
Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.
"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two errors contributed to the killing.
First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.
Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.
He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.
"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.
Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.
"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting one's instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape constantly shifts.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.
For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.
There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.
Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.
Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a wrenching decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.
And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.
Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.
From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.
Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"
Size of China’s self drive tourism market may exceed RMB1 trillion by 2020
[Abstract] Against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading and widespread popularity of free-and-easy travel, self drive tourism has received support from national policies, and is welcomed by an increasing number of consumers.
At the same time however, the self drive travel market, the size of which is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion, is confronted with twin challenges.
Against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading and widespread popularity of free-and-easy travel, self drive tourism has received support from national policies, and is welcomed by an increasing number of consumers.
At the same time however, the self drive travel market, the size of which is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion, is confronted with twin challenges. On the one hand, the development of the self drive travel industry is out of step with market demand. Self drive travel organizers such as self drive clubs and travel agents are confronted with meager profits. On the other hand, self drive travel ae confronted with infrastructure and services that are still in their infant stages.
Accounting for 60% of total tourists in domestic tourism, with market size expected to exceed RMB1 trillion
In 2016, domestic tourism numbered some 4.44 billion persons, with self drive travel accounting for approximately 60% of total tourists in domestic tourism. By 2020, the size of the self drive travel market is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion.
Statistics concerning the number of persons engaged in self drive travel published by China Tourism Automobile And Cruise Association showed that the number of persons engaged in self drive travel has continued to grow over the last five years. The share of such tourists as a proportion to domestic tourists has stabilized at above 50%.
At the same time, all regions as well as the State have shown greater concern and support for self drive tourism, this new emerging sector. From 2016 to 2017, a slew of policies and regulations relevant to vehicles for self drive travel, and motorhome and camping tourism have been promulgated.
In July 2017, eight government agencies including the China National Tourism Administration and the State General Administration of Sports jointly issued the “Plans for the Development of Automobile Campsites for Self Drive Sports”. In the same month, in the “Action Plan for Advancing Quality Enhancement and Upgrading in Rural Travel Development (2017)“ jointly printed and circulated by 14 government agencies including the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance, self drive travel was mentioned as a priority.
The introduction of policy measures has provided opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self drive travel.
Self drive travel clubs make meager profits; complete industry chain is key
Although there is enormous potential in the self drive travel market, and active guidance from national policy measures, the self drive travel industry is still at its infancy stage.
According to the “2016-2017 Annual Report on the Development of China’s Self Drive Travel Industry”, domestic self drive travel clubs, automobile clubs and automobile enthusiasts clubs number in the thousands, tourists who arrange their own travel itinerary account for a larger proportion. The proportion of tourists who join automobile enthusiasts clubs, self drive travel clubs and other such entities only account for about 15%.
Meanwhile, there are only a handful of online tour companies and traditional travel agencies that develop proprietary products for self drive travel. Many online travel platforms only sell self drive travel products provided by some suppliers. Some self drive travel clubs are also key suppliers.
In terms of organizing self drive travel activities, this encompass various aspects including “board, lodging, transport, travel, shopping, entertainment”. Fragmentation is high, and upstream supply chain heavy. There is also significant randomness in tourist spending.
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing XTX Auto Club, believes that self drive travel clubs are similar to travel agencies in essence. The primary earnings model at the initial stage are mainly based on offline activities. The core areas are self drive travel route products and guide services.
However, there is significant product homogeneity in route products within the self drive sector, and the standard of guide services is mixed. Self drive travel clubs are again confronted with the need to restructure.
It is quite apparent that self drive travel is not an independent industry in and of itself. Rather, it is an inter-regional and -industry ecosystem based on movement characteristics of self drive travel. The creation of a complete industry chain is key.
Experts have pointed out that in addition to basic tourist consumption, experience is a more important consumption element.
Hence, with regards to the development of the self drive travel industry, the experience feature should be enhanced. A “self drive travel +” theme as well as self drive travel product IP should be developed.
Scenic routes are not merely roads, and automobile campsites should not merely meet board and lodging requirements
Confronted with the rise in self drive travel, the development of self drive travel infrastructure is similarly still fairly rudimentary.
Li Guanjie pointed out that scenic travel routes are not merely a road. Rather, traffic and tourism elements should be integrated into it. However, building roads and tourism are the responsibility of two separate department. The increase in tourism element by transport departments are still stuck at the level of building rest rooms, information centers, publicity bulletin boards and other such facilities. Their degree of bonding with the tourism is low.
These could draw lessons from the building experience of the renowned self drive route of “US Route 66”,
The design of scenic routes is no longer the most direct and fastest route from the place of origin to the destination but adhering to the design concept of “experience the joy of driving” so as to provide self drive travelers the best enjoyment of beautiful scenery along the route. Scenic routes are able to connect spots and facets of the travel landscape. These would help retain the historical value and cultural value of the eco-tourism resources along the route. Meanwhile, various thematic activities may also be held to enhance tourist participation and recreation experience, creating economic benefit for the local tourism industry.
In addition to scenic routes, campsites are also important supporting facilities for self drive travel.
However, a Beijing News reporter understands from self drive travelers that few consumers would choose to stay at campsites.
They believe that many campsites are infrastructure and can only meet board and lodging requirements. Considered low class with dull product features, they are unable to meet the multi-faceted demands of self drive travel.
An industry insider who wished to remain anonymous said that a few years ago, enterprises operate campsite mostly for the purpose of acquiring land. After they acquire the land, follow-up development of complementary infrastructure and services have not caught up. These operators are loss-making, and do not have later-stage capital injection. Hence, providing corresponding complementary products proved very difficult.
Consumer groups
Data published by the China Tourism Automobile And Cruise Association in 2017 showed that in terms of age, self drive travelers are concentrated in the 21-40 age group, mostly in the 31-40 cohort. This group has a certain level of income, and are relatively demanding in terms of customized travel. Many are family oriented customers.
A survey in lodging revealed that self drive travelers prefer non-standard lodging.
In terms of self drive travel categories, driving in neighboring areas is the predominant category, accounting for 84. 32%.
Self drive travel overseas is a dream for many, but the proportion is still relatively small.
Meanwhile, with higher consumption demand, tourists who enjoyed self drive “tour of sights” have begun to change their opinion. Instead of “alighting to take photos, and boarding to sleep” during the self drive travel process, they are now more concerned with the travel experience and process.
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'
The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'
The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.
After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.
It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.
'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.
'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.
Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.
Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.
I can count the scales on its sole.'
Reporters understand that adding alginate, humic acid and amino acid nutrient carriers of natural or plant sources into the production process of urea would change modify and enhance the benefit of traditional urea. The alginate urea, zinc fulvate urea and aminoglutanic acid urea nitrogen utilization rate was 5 to 10 percentage points higher than general urea.
In a positive environment, an increase in crop yield potential will be significant; in particular, large value-added urea pallets are quality raw materials for bulk blending fertilizer.
The total number of security personnel is double that of the 2012 London Olympics.
In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will start the largest ever security linkage plan.
Earlier, Brazil government has said that a total of 85,000 troops and polices, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 polices, will fight together for the security of the Olympics.
Most troops will be responsible for safeguarding the Olympic venues, while the new 3,000 troops will be responsible for the security of international airports, subway stations and streets.
The polices will patrol around other areas of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio and provided security services for the Olympics.
In addition to the four competition areas, they will also patrol airports and main roads connecting airports to the Olympic venues.
Appraisal mechanisms in the services sector are nothing new. The key to having these appraisal mechanisms play an effective role is to have more effective supervision, rather than being a mere formality.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.
Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."
"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
In that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.
It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."
"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.
"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.
Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.
There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.
They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.
Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It all just came."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.
Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."
Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.
"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Online translation services were actually already available on the Internet a decade ago, and in fact, a very long time ago, there was a prevalent view that “machines will replace human translation”.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.
By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.
From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.
That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.
There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.
When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.
"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."
The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.
It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.
"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.
"I get goosebumps still talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.
That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.
Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
As far as computers are concerned, whether Chinese checkers or chess, defeating humans was already a clinch decades ago.

Forget purchasing agents! These 8000-plus products enjoy zero tariff
At the regular press conference of the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) held on January 11th, spokesperson Gao Feng said that to date, China has 15 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) in force, involving 23 countries and regions, encompassing more than 8000 imported products at zero tariff.
Meanwhile, you no longer have to spend a lot of money to have purchasing agents buy the products you want such as imported cosmetics, salmon from Iceland, red wine from Chile, tropical fruits from ASEAN ....
Currently, China has signed 16 FTAs, involving 24 countries and regions, of which 15 have come into effect, encompassing more than 8000 imported products at zero tariff.
Take agricultural produce for example. The implementation of the FTAs has meant that consumers can now sample affordable agricultural produce from different places of production throughout the year.
For instance, import tariffs have been cut to zero for the following products: tropical fruits from ASEAN such as durians, lychees, and pitaya from 15-30% previously;
salmon from Iceland, from 10- 12%; and
red wine from Georgia and Chile, from 14-30%.
Specialty agricultural products such as beef and milk powder from New Zealand have also seen a relatively large reduction in tariffs.
Industrial products have benefited as well. For example, import tariffs for some cosmetics from Switzerland have been reduced to zero, while
that for some watches have fallen to 50%, and will fall further to zero in a few years’ time;
products from South Korea such as refrigerators, rice cookers, massage devices, and cosmetic apparatus will now be subject to a lower import tariff of 40%, and fall further to zero in a few years’ time;
and consumer electronics and other relevant products have also seen a relatively large reduction in tariffs.
Products at zero tariff under the FTAs also include intermediates and raw materials required for the domestic production of end-user consumer goods, which will, to a certain extent, also upgrade the mix of domestically produced consumer goods.
MOFCOM spokesperson Gao Feng said that approximately one-third of China’s total imported products enjoy tariff concessions under the FTAs, of which the majority are end-user consumer goods, thus providing tangible benefits to consumers.
Further reductions in import tariffs of consumer goods
On December 1, 2017, China further lowered the import tariffs of some consumer goods. The reductions covered 187 eight-digit HS codes comprising food, health supplements, pharmaceuticals, chemical products for daily use, clothing, footwear and headgear, home appliances, culture and recreation, miscellaneous and sundry goods, as well as other consumer goods.
The average tariff rate of these consumer goods more than halved, plunging from 17.3% to 7.7%!
With effect from January 1, 2018, partial adjustments were also made to other import and export tariffs.
The import tariffs of lipstick, eye shadow, perfume and some other cosmetics fell from 10% to 5%.
This decline in tariff rates means that consumers do not have to have a purchasing agent or travel overseas to buy the foreign products they like.

Foreign press: Year-end return policies at US malls vary widely; be cautious when returning gifts
China News Service, December 29
US-based “World Journal” reported that there was a wave of gift returns just after Christmas.
A report by American Broadcasting Company (ABC) revealed that approximately half of the goods sold last Christmas were exchanged or returned.
Elsewhere, readers had repeatedly reported having been cheated while shopping online. Shoppers should be on their guard when shopping at unofficial websites.
In general, large shopping companies have official and reasonable return procedures, but if you have shopped for gifts at certain small stores or online, you must be careful.
A Madame Hou of Rowland Heights bought a jacket from an online store specializing in print jackets for more than $60 (USD, the same hereinafter) on December 1, local time, but has yet to receive her purchase.
She sent an email to customer service but did not receive any reply from the store.
Elsewhere, a netizen revealed that when on tour in the US last year, he bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller, but received a box of plasticine on delivery instead.
After he realized he was deceived, he applied for a refund from the website. Fortunately, he was able to receive a full refund.
Nonetheless, some customers felt that website refund services are not perfect.
Mr Wang, an ethnic Chinese resident of Northern California, purchased goods at a certain website on urgent delivery services twice at a cost of $4 each but both times, the goods failed to arrive promptly.
He applied for a refund subsequently but did not get a reply.
Large department stores or shopping malls have better return policies.
Most of Macy’s merchandise may be returned for a full refund within 180 days,
but the merchandise has to be in its “original” state, and the customer has to produce proof of purchase such as the receipt or the bank purchase record.
Without proof of purchase, the customer may also receive the store’s credit which may be used to purchase other merchandise.
Target has a 90-day return deadline for general merchandise. For electronic products, the deadline is normally 15 days,
but it is extended to 30 days for electronic and entertainment related products purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017;
note that the 30-day return deadline begins on December 25, i.e., merchandise purchased must be returned by January 25, 2018.
The ultimate shopping experience with the advent of a new era in commercial district shopping development
More than 10 years ago, China was, on the whole, still a sellers’ market. Selection was limited, and so was demand.
A decade hence, the market has long developed into a buyers’ rather than that of a sellers’ market. Shoppers have now become a lot more demanding as well, and are no longer satisfied simply with a “cash on delivery of goods” shopping behavior.
Therefore, how to offer shoppers the ultimate shopping experience has become the next competitive point for real estate developers.
Of the many factors that affect a shopper’s shopping experience, the impact of shopping centers in business districts is the most important.
Let’s take a look at how urban builders focus on the shopping experience.
No two leaves are alike, nor can one find two completely identical shopping malls. A famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics.
Take Turkey’s world-renowned Kanyon Shopping Center. Its unique undulating architectural design was inspired by the Grand Canyon, hence its homophonous name Kanyon. You feel like you’re in the Grand Canyon when walking along the 200-meter footpath in the midsection of Kanyon.
In addition to the canyon-like design, there is a large unique inward concave oval-shaped performance venue in the middle of shopping center where specialty performances are often held.
Its open platform design offers visitors at every floor a view of the activities held in the “canyon”, and the scene changes as you take each step.
In China, the Nanjing Forest Mall Commercial Street, known as the country’s first forest style pedestrian consumption venue, is a perfect integration of shopping and ecology as well as fairy tales.
With a 7,000 sqm green plaza, and a 3,000 sqm rooftop water feature, the project is made up of nine individual buildings, linked by a sky bridge. The sunken garden design for the entire project, plane trees as its architectural surface, and the rooftop water feature create the feeling of being in a forest.
On entering the Forest Mall, you’d feel like you have accidentally fallen down the rabbit hole in Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland. The tall tree trunks surround the buildings, and the lawn and stream are beautifully juxtaposed, drawing the masses into a forest full of life and vitality.
Then there is Chonqing. The Lijia Waterfront Business District built by Longhu Properties has plans to attract a diverse range of businesses, and expects to bring in more than 50 world class flagship stores, with more than 100 world class brands and over 500 renowned foreign and domestic brands so as to create a commercial center with a distinctive theme that brings the services sector together.
In addition, the Lijia Waterfront Business District will also integrate ecology into architecture. Based on a transit-oriented development (TOD) concept, it integrates shopping, household services and amenities, dining, entertainment, education and sports, providing shoppers the ultimate shopping experience while affording them the luxury of enjoying Chongqing’s unique “waterfront culture”, a perfect blend of shopping, and water entertainment and recreation.
From the above examples, it is noted that, at present, a number of real estate developers have noticed the discovery of this new urban business phenomenon. Insiders indicate that this consumption model which is centered on the consumer experience and which explores the means to combine shopping and experience will become the mainstream of urban development in the future.
Today’s business districts are no longer merely the distribution centers of goods. Rather, they are more integrated venues that bring together the arts and culture as well as creative themes; they also carry the responsibility of the masses toward urban living.
Therefore, in addition to meeting the one-stop material needs of dining and entertainment of consumers, maximizing the transmission of multi-tiered cultural and artistic spiritual needs, as well as bringing the livable qualities of residential needs into play will inevitably become the high point of future business district development.
In Chongqing, Guoxing Property’s Beianjiangshan is located north of the Yangtze River, close to Guanyin Bridge, where the who’s who of world business and international giants agglomerate, and first class brands congregate, affording a seamless connection with international fashion.
Here, prosperity abounds, and the best in the world agglomerate.
Dongyuanjinyue, which is in the immediate vicinity of Nanping Business District, has a better shopping environment. At its sole disposal is Western China’s, and indeed, the nation’s leading four-story three-dimensional transportation system, enhancing shopping comfort.
Elsewhere, the landscaped gardens and shops along the two pedestrian streets at Huigong Road and Wanda Plaza have been upgraded, with approximately 300 trees planted, and 40,000 sqm of floor space revamped, lifting the image of Nanping Business District.
Meanwhile, Longhu’s Waterfront City, in the immediate vicinity of Chongqing’s first low-density waterfront business district - Lijia Waterfront Business District - is surrounded by nine parks. The commercial street district is low density with good access. These qualities have made shoppers more willing to stay, stop and slowing savor the joy of shopping when shopping, rather than being jostled by crowds of shoppers into rushing forward. Here, “shopping at a leisurely pace” is truly achieved.
Competition will only intensify going forward. In a market of rampant homogenization, how to achieve success, and attain a reputation as a “shopping mecca” in the hearts of future shoppers deserve serious consideration among all real estate developers.
A differentiation strategy alone is far from sufficient. Only developers that truly place shoppers in their hearts, empathize with shoppers, and offer shoppers an ultimate yet simple shopping experience will be able to stand tall in a market when assailed by intense competition.
To be sure, I believe that, at the end of the day, Chongqing’s residents are the happiest lot to have such excellent shopping experience and business districts. A decade ago, no one would have imagined today’s prosperity.
Shopping carnival: Consumerism revelry masks true environmental cost
RMB168.2 billion. That was the amount of money Tmall users spent over a 24-hour period on November 11, 2017 at the “Tmall 11.11 Global Shopping Festival”.
Specifically, in the span of three minutes right after the “Double 11” commenced, Tmall’s transaction volume surpassed RMB10 billion, and exceeded RMB20 billion in six minutes and five seconds; within nine hours, it broke through the RMB100 billion mark.
That day, shoppers all over the world made a total of 1.48 billion payments by way of Alipay, an increase of 41% year-on-year.
Such spending resulted in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether the Tmall shopping platform or the Alipay payment platform, however, both belonged to Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group.
Ten years ago, no one would have imagined that the “Singles’ Day” subculture which was a self-deprecating celebration created by singles on November 11 would be co-opted by e-commerce merchants, and turned into a phenomenal “Singles’ Day” shopping carnival today.
Alibaba used the “Great Singles’ Day Sale” marketing gimmick: Not dating? Singles, come shop online - for the first time on November 11, 2009.
The outcome was a surprise. That day, transactions at Taobao Mall (the predecessor of “Tmall”) surpassed RMB52 million, 10 times that of the normal daily transaction value at the time.
From then on, “Double 11” has become a shopping festival created by Alibaba, and has grown and expanded from a domestic buyer-seller amusement to an inflow of global merchants. Nine years hence, and the more than RMB100 billion worth of transactions of Tmall’s “Double 11” is now more than 3200 times that of the first year, far outstripping that of “Black Friday”.
Numerous e-commerce merchants have followed Tmall’s “Double 11” sales promotion, with “JD.com” the strongest competitor.
“JD.com” has its own shopping festival “6.18” but its impact is less than that of “Double 11”. From November 1 to 11 this year, “JD.com”’s accumulated sales amounted to RMB127.1 billion.
The “Double 12” discount extravaganza and the Christmas-New Year shopping period come right after “Double 11”.
Following the New Year, pre-Spring Festival’s Lunar New Year shopping as well as Valentine's Day shopping await the Chinese consumer. Retail consumption knows no holiday.
Massive instantaneous consumption has led to environmental problems, which has attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
A Xinhua Daily Telegraph report revealed that based on the industry’s general standard conservative estimate of 0.2 kg per packaging cartons, at least 300,000 tonnes of trash were generated during this year’s “Singles’ Day” period.
Liu Hua, Director of the Pollution Prevention Program at Greenpeace East Asia told chinadialogue that the volume of orders at this year’s “Singles’ Day” from Tmall alone would generate 160,000 tonnes of packaging trash.
In 2016, the State Post Bureau published a report stating that approximately 780 million items were delivered by express couriers during the 2015 “Singles’ Day” period (November 11-16), with more than 3 billion woven bags, 9.922 billion packaging cartons, and 16.985 billion meters of adhesive tape used. The length of adhesive tape used could go round the equator 425 times.
This year, the State Post Bureau estimates that the “Singles’ Day” express business volume could surpass 1.5 billion items.
Wang Shi, manager of a waste incineration plant in Beijing told Xinhua News Agency that more than 2,000 tonnes of trash enter the plant each day after “Singles’ Day”, exceeding the treatment capacity of the incineration plant.
Express delivery companies have also become aware that the environmental pollution resulting from the express delivery sector should not be ignored.
Some e-commerce logistics enterprises, including Suning, have introduced plastic express delivery boxes that may be recycled and reused ahead of “Singles’ Day”, as well as recyclable packaging such as shopping bags and trash bags that may be used repeatedly. However, acceptance among consumers who could not be bothered was low.
Jack Ma, on Weibo, has also called on the logistics industry to support “green packaging” and “green logistics”.
This Weibo received more than 68,000 “likes”.
What sort of mobile payment do Germans want?
Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment war waged in Germany is nothing new.
All WeChat Pay and Alipay did was to move the battleground to Europe. Neither the competitors nor the battleground has changed - the Chinese; is this really globalization?
Where there’s Alipay, there’s WeChat Pay.
According to the agreement with Germany’s electronic payment services provider Wirecard, WeChat Pay officially entered Germany in November this year. The Chinese company has also gradually expanded its presence among merchants in Europe.
This time round, the reunion of the two “fellow countrymen” in a foreign country took place in Europe.
All along, Alipay and WeChat Pay have been riding high on the road to globalization.
In a study on China’s mobile Internet payment’s globalization methods, iResearch Consulting’s “2017 China's Third-Party Mobile Payment Report” arrived at two methods: The first method would be by way of strategic investment, outward transfer of experience, taking an equity stake, and supporting the overseas local mobile payment enterprise;
the second method would be by way of promoting mobile payment services to overseas merchants through Chinese tourists’ overseas spending behavior, thereby changing overseas local entities’ recognition and acceptance of China’s mobile payments.
Indeed, win over the Chinese, and you win the world.
China’s rapid economic growth coupled with its large population base have meant that spending by Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure,
but this also means that the mobile payment war waged in Germany is nothing new.
All WeChat Pay and Alipay did was to move the battleground to Europe. Neither the competitors nor the battleground has changed - it’s still the Chinese; is this really globalization?
A more groundbreaking inquiry would be whether China’s mobile payment can expand its territory in Europe.
Germany is an example.
Magical “new retail”
Chen Xinlei, Yang Kaihan: When Amazon made it to the world’s top 10 list of retailers, it announced that it would venture into the bookstores and grocery stores; this is worth pondering, both in terms of opportunity and motive.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle. This was followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened its bookstore and New York, and planned to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced that its checkout-free grocery store Amazon Go would begin trial operations. No waiting in line or checkout is necessary. All customers have to do is scan their QR code on the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take the products they want and leave. The shopping amount would be charged to the customers’ Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, its sudden but frequent forays into physical stores in the last few years have been very unexpected.
This is because way back in 2007, CEO Jeff Bezos, in his “Letter to Shareholders”, highlighted that Amazon would not arbitrarily start a new business (such as a physical store) unless the four conditions set out below are met simultaneously:
1. We must convince ourselves that the new opportunity can generate the returns on capital our investors expected when they invested in Amazon;
2. we must convince ourselves that the new business can grow to a scale where it can be significant in the context of our overall company;
3. we must believe that the opportunity is currently underserved; and
4. we have the capabilities needed to bring strong customer-facing differentiation to the marketplace.
Bookstores and grocery stores are the two most precarious physical retail sub-sectors, and were the first to be knocked out after the rise of Amazon.
When Amazon made it to the world’s top 10 list of retailers, it announced that it would venture into these two physical markets; this is worth pondering, both in terms of opportunity and motive.
Did Amazon do something in contrary to the guarantee it made in its letter to shareholders?
Similar words were echoed at the other end of the world. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at The Computing Conference 2016 held in Yunqi, Hangzhou, Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma said in his keynote address that,
“From next year onward, Alibaba will no longer talk about ‘e-commerce’.
The era of pure e-commerce firms will soon come to an end. E-commerce will no longer exist in the next 10 to 20 years, replaced instead by ‘new retail’.
Only by combining online and offline operations will new retail come into being.”
In an instant, it was as if the words “new retail” took on magical properties, and became the new catchphrase of industry insiders.
So what is “new retail” exactly?
If it merely referred to online-offline integration, then the concept is nothing new.
In 2016, eMarketer, after tracking 180 of the largest e-commerce firms, estimated that total sales of e-commerce firms amounted to approximately US$200 billion, of which the largest 25 accounted for more than US$159 billion;
and of these 25, 18 were traditional retailers that had only begun online operations in the preceding five years (such as Macy’s, Nordstrom, Target and Gap).
Indeed, Alibaba Group's RMB28.3 billion acquisition of an equity stake in Suning Commerce Group was still fresh in the minds of the public.
From a global perspective, both retailers and e-commerce firms are transforming from a single channel to a multi-channel retail system that encompasses physical stores, e-commerce, mobile terminals and social media.
Could Jack Ma’s “new retail” be more of a conclusion rather than a forecast for the future?
If not, then what is the difference between the multi-channel concept and “new retail”?
Perhaps, the crux of the matter is not whether online and offline entities would integrate, but how.
A review of the retail sector in the last 20 years has revealed that the rise of e-commerce was similar to the emergence of discount retailers many years ago; both were focused on price and convenience.
On the basis of these two trigger points, e-commerce firms moved highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, online from offline.
As online retail habits formed, and customer experience continued to rise, e-commerce firms further extended their scope to other product categories, and began to increase efficiency.
In Aliababa CEO Daniel Zhang’s words, “Use the thinking behind and technology of the Internet to thoroughly reform and upgrade the approximately 30 trillion retailers in society at this time, so that the increasingly demanding retail requirements of Chinese consumers may be effectively met. This will make the entire goods production, circulation and services process more efficient with the extensive application of the Internet and big data.”
Thus, the path of e-commerce firms is asset-light on the surface, but asset-heavy in reality.
“Light” refers to fixed assets, headcount, management processes and other burdens that are less than that of traditional retailers; “heavy” refers to areas such as logistics and storage that require enormous investment.
Changes in logistical methods ensured the efficiency of e-commerce firms.
The Chinese Central Government’s official web portal reported that Premier Li Keqiang presided over the State Council executive meeting held on April 28, which was of the opinion that expanding domestic consumption was a key measure for stable growth and structural transformation.
The meeting determined that relevant departments should promptly put forward specific plans on the basis of scientific evaluation.
The import tariffs of some foreign goods for daily use for which domestic consumers have enormous demand will be lowered on a trial basis with effect from June this year, and tariff reductions will be extended to more goods over time.
Together with the tax reform, consumption tax policies for general consumer goods such as clothing and cosmetics will be optimized, with overall adjustments made to the scope of taxation, tax rates, and the different parts of the taxation process.
More port of entry duty-free shops will be set up and restored, and the variety of duty-free goods will be expanded appropriately, with the value of duty-free shopping increased by a certain amount so that domestic consumers would find it convenient to purchase foreign products in China.
Shopping and customs clearance, as well as tax refund for foreign tourists would expedited, and the requirement for voluntary tax declaration of imported goods shall be strictly implemented according to the law.
Policies that support the inspection and quarantine of cross-border e-commerce imports shall be formulated, and unreasonable fees pertaining to imports shall be put in order.
The program to promote the brands of Chinese products shall be accelerated, the development of physical stores supported, and online-offline interaction achieved.
Market order shall be normalized, and strong measures shall be taken to crack down on counterfeit and shoddy products so that the survival of the fittest will be advanced.
Consumers will be able to shop without having to go far, with comfort and ease of mind, and convenience.
BlackBerry mobile phones have never been known to wow the crowd with their hardware, but pressure from competition has meant that it has to offer a presentable model. Hence, the Passport was launched last September.
SONY would often launch various black technology products. For instance, this flagship-class 4K ultra short throw projector it launched at the beginning of the year was one such example.
Naturally, such a high-end, classy, top-grade product comes with a hefty price tag as well. At JPY5 million, equivalent to approximately RMB250,000, it would be enough to buy a car.
Big screen luxury TVs have always been the hallmark of technological competence of manufacturers. The multiple award winning LG 77-inch curved OLED 4K Smart TV is a classic example of this type of products.
This is not merely a simple fixed angle curved screen TV, but a complex device that allows the user to adjust the curvature according to the user’s position!
Based on its 9mm ultra thin display screen, LG has made the curvature of the entire screen difficult to detect with the naked eye, thus achieving maximum variation for a maximum 4000R curvature.
Simply press the remote control, and the best angle of the 77-inch screen will move as the user wishes, making it suitable for any viewing scene.
Leica’s position in the field of cameras is well known. This Leica T mirrorless camera, launched last year, uses the brand new T mount as the lens mount for the Leica mirrorless camera.
In addition to the T mount 23mm fixed and 18-56 zoom lenses launched at the same time, the M-Adapter T allows users of the Leica M series of lenses to attach and use the camera as well.
Triumph has accurately grasped the crux of these issues, and developed the new Magic Wire bra.

On January 18, Alibaba held an e-commerce poverty eradication summit in Chongqing, and announced that it would explore a new “Internet + Poverty eradication” model to help spur measures targeted at eradicating poverty and revitalize the rural economy.
This follows Alibaba’s rural strategy, launch of the Rural Taobao program, online rural revitalization and poverty relief platform, as well as the founding of the Alibaba Poverty Relief Fund, and is a step-up commitment by Alibaba toward combating poverty.
Combating and eradicating poverty is presently one of China’s key national strategies.
Complete eradication of poverty is unprecedented in the history of China.
“Poverty relief via e-commerce is a new round of innovative measures aimed at poverty relief and development. It is an important means to achieve measures targeted at poverty relief and eradication.
The Central government very concerned with this issue and has indicated that the Internet can play a part in helping to combat poverty, advance measures targeted at poverty relief and eradication, as well as allow agricultural products to be sold outside the countryside via the Internet.”
As such, Alibaba had proposed a rural strategy as far back as 2014, which together with big data cloud computing and globalization are its three major core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Alibaba launched the Rural Taobao program, recruiting “village partners” to help lift villagers out of poverty and move toward affluence by way of e-commerce.
In 2017, Alibaba worked together with the Ministry of Commerce to create a rural revitalization and poverty relief channel that is now connected to a total of 13 provinces and 120 national level poverty-stricken counties.
The Alibaba platform has incubated 2118 Taobao Villages,
of which close to 400 have emerged in poverty-stricken counties of various provinces, and 33 in 13 poverty-stricken provinces.
In 2017, at Alibaba’s China retail platform, nationwide sales of Taobao Villages amounted to RMB120 billion.
Daniel Zhang said that confronted with the national strategy to combat poverty, Alibaba has been thinking about how it could effectively use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovative competencies within the Alibaba economy to help develop a new path for poverty eradication.
Rural Taobao, in particular, is a major platform to help eradicate poverty via e-commerce, and has opened up a new online direct supply and sales link to help eradicate poverty.
At planting phase, Rural Taobao and Ant Financial Services have jointly offered means to acquire agricultural resources and tools as well as obtain micro-loans.
In 2017, of the 832 national-level poverty-stricken counties, 795 were served by Ant Financial Services, which provided convenient payments, credit and other relevant services.
Cainiao helped with warehousing and logistics, while Tmall was responsible for selling. Alibaba Cloud’s big data provided feedback and guidance on agricultural production, further raising the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of the agricultural produce.
The growth in poverty eradication via e-commerce not only requires products, sales channels and industry planning, it also requires talent.
By way of the e-commerce courses conducted by Taobao University, Alibaba teaches farmers standardized, quality and large-scale methods of cultivation, achieving a combination of “Poverty relief + Knowledge support” so that poverty eradication among farmers is sustainable.
These courses have already reached approximately 92% of national-level poverty-stricken counties.
The “philanthropic mentality, commercial means” poverty eradication thinking can also ensure that Alibaba will “genuinely perform poverty relief” when carrying out poverty relief activities.
Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma once said that eradicating poverty should be divided into three phases - poverty relief, poverty eradication and becoming affluent.
Poverty relief is to give someone a fish; poverty eradication is to teach someone to fish; and becoming affluent is to build a “fish pond” for farmers so that farmers can breed fish.
Poverty relief through industry development led by e-commerce is building that fish pond.
In terms of poverty relief through industry development, Alibaba has partnered Luochuan County in Shaanxi Province to create a Luochuan apple poverty relief through industry development model, which has been replicated and promoted nationwide as a model by relevant departments.
Alibaba’s poverty relief via e-commerce initiatives have also won the recognition of decision makers.
E-commerce firms, represented by Alibaba, have been given the message that farmers would see an increase in production and income with the help of online and offline channels.
Some village partners and Ant Financial staff have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their poverty relief via e-commerce experience.
Currently, the China office of The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has already partnered Rural Taobao in implementing a poverty relief through industry development program in Anhui and other areas.
Sina Finance news. The “3rd New Economy Think Tank Summit” jointly organized by Ali Research Institute and the China Visionary Think Tank Forum was held on January 16. Zhang Li, deputy director of the e-commerce research department at the Ministry of Commerce Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation attended and addressed the Summit.
She believed that our globalization had in fact ignored the most fundamental issues, i.e., those related to the essence and form of globalization, as well as issues associated with phases of globalization.
As a result, many believed that globalization has stagnated. Moreover, in the new phase, many developed and developing countries hold different attitudes toward globalization and its pattern.
The second concept is concerned with issues related to the intermediate phase of globalization. What constrains the intermediate phase of globalization?
The reason why globalization is constrained by the economic environment and fundamentals is precisely because changing economic fundamentals have led to constraints on globalization.
Zhang Li believed that adjustments to the global economy have generally come to an end at the end of 2017. A new growth phase, will begin in 2018, and growth will be driven by producer goods.
JD’s first fresh food supermarket 7FRESH officially opened for business recently, and plans to set up more than 1,000 stores nationwide in three to five years.
Together with Alibaba’s Hema Supermarket, Yonghui Superstores’ Super Species, Suning’s SUFRESH, Meituan’s Zhangyu Store, and others, “new retail outlets” have begun to emerge in clusters, and have even “challenged” each other on price in this innovative model.
The fresh food supermarket war has escalated, and have become a phenomenal topic in the new retail sector. Just what is new in new retail?
“We will rapidly expand nationwide in 2018, and will open a large number of stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival,”
Hema Supermarket CEO Hou Yi revealed the company’s new approach for 2018 at the 2nd New Retail Summit on the 10th.
“With effect from 2018, Hema will not merely be a fresh produce e-commerce firm; rather, we will be a general household goods and grocery e-commerce firm that meets consumers’ requirement for prompt delivery service.
The core model calls for conduction and experience in offline stores, while genuine sales are done online.”
Unlike traditional hypermarkets and supermarkets, Hema Supermarket is, in the eyes of many consumers, a popular Internet store that is fun and has good food. Some intermediaries have even come up with the concept of “He district housing” (housing within a 3km radius of a Hema Supermarket).
Both online e-commerce platforms and offline retail stores have their respective strengths and weaknesses, and consumers are present at various channels. Therefore, both parties are attempting the multi-channel model.
Industry insiders believe that against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading, more “Hema type” stores will be opened in 2018.
Meanwhile, Hema has continued to widen its product scope, expanding from fresh foods initially into other consumer goods. This suggests that more innovation in the retail market will be forthcoming in the new year.
“For instance, the integrated online-offline business model has attracted consumer eyeballs. Fresh foods supermarkets that have opened across the country have been popular among and welcomed by the masses.”
“Nonetheless, these relationships are useless regardless of how much you talk about them or how cool they are. At the end of the day, it’s all about whether or not you have given consumers a good experience. Only after I have had an experience would I be willing to foot the bill.”
As far as RT-Mart’s feiniu.com CEO Yuan Bin is concerned, under the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed; and shopping requirements have changed as well.
Originally, there was a clear demarcation between online and offline; offline wanted to defeat online, and online wanted to counter-attack offline. Now, on the other hand, it’s become a partnership, because consumers no longer see a difference between online and offline.
Capital, competing for a slice of the pie, has made the retail market, represented by fresh food supermarkets, a powder keg.
Analysis shows that at present, new retail competition in Tier 1 cities is still a long way from a red ocean situation, and there is still plenty of Tier 2 cities yet to be explored. Enormous opportunities and potential exist in the market.
New retail plans proposed by different types of industries will lead new retail development into a state of diversified growth.
CCTV-2 and the National Academy of Economic Strategy, CASS have compiled a stack of dry goods, i.e., this weighty annual report on the development of the e-commerce industry in China.
What sort of report card did China’s e-commerce industry receive this year?
What are the growth trends of the global e-commerce industry?
Let us reveal the results one by one.
Total sales volume set a new record while growth returned to the acceleration track
China’s online retail sales have been sky rocketing since 2006. This may be attributed to the fact that online shopping was still a very novel idea at the time. Shopping without leaving home; cool!
Since 2013 however, the online retail sales growth rate has decelerated from more than 50% to less than 40% for the first time in 2015; in 2016, the growth rate was 26.2%.
The situation changed this year, however. Online retail sales accelerated again. For the first nine months of this year, growth rate rebounded to 34.2%,
significantly higher than the growth rates seen in 2015 and 2016.
Perhaps shoppers took a detour but eventually realized that retail therapy does wonders for one’s mind and body.
In particular, online retail sales of physical goods amounted to approximately RMB5.08 trillion, while online retail sales of services amounted to nearly RMB1.49 trillion.
This comprised 13.6% of total retail sales of consumer goods, up nearly 3 percentage points year-on-year.
Wake up, students. It’s time to highlight the key points. Online retail sales of services was definitely a major contributor!
Elsewhere, per capita online shopping of French netizens who are obsessed with online shopping amounted to US$1,925. Goods they purchased online are primarily clothing, worthy of being called a nation of fashion lovers.
Who says those who love online shopping most must be young?
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.
Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
So she called in outsiders for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.
"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.
Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.
"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.
"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.
Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.
Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.
But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?' "
Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.
And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."

The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices makes for a long day for the Bruins
It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.
Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.
For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.
Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.
"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.
The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.
"We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.
I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."
UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.
If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we got.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place."
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) revealed that in the second quarter of this year, residential property prices in Australia nationwide rose by an average of 1.5% to 2%, and were 3.5% higher on an annual basis, the lowest annual growth rate since March 2013.
Just when real estate agents were looking forward to selling more real estate during the holiday season, growth rate of residential property prices was the lowest since 2013.
IT Home reported this morning that Wall Street Journal claimed that AT&T has canceled plans to sell Huawei’s new flagship smart phone in the US.
Huawei’s original plan was to announce this partnership at the CES this week, but AT&T canceled the partnership at the last minute.
In a January 9 response to a Bloomberg reporter as regards this turn of events (January 9 US local time), Huawei said that it would release its new product and specific listing information to the US market.
Huawei indicated that in the past five years, it has already launched high-end products worldwide and in the US market, proving its strength and competence.
According to the earlier IT Home report, Huawei will unveil the “best smartphone you’ve never heard of” in the afternoon of January 9 at the CES held in Las Vegas. The battery life of this model could support two days of continuous use.
Industry insiders generally believe that the flagship mobile phone Huawei will soon unveil is the Huawei Mate 10 Pro equipped with Android Oreo.
Yangcheng Evening News reporter Wang Li. The film “I Am Not Madame Bovary” starring Fan Bingbing, as well as Guo Tao, Da Peng, Zhang Jiayi and others, will be released nationwide on September 30.
Yesterday, the film held a workshop with the theme “Sorrow in Comedies” in Beijing. Feng Xiaogang, Ning Hao and Da Peng attended the event.
Alternating circular and square image composition; the director was simply willful What was special about “I Am Not Madame Bovary” was the alternating circular and square image compositions. In particular, the circular frames shot with a hooded lens were fresh and interesting.
Feng Xiaogang explained, “ This theme was very similar to Director Zhang Yimou’s “The Story of Qiu Ju”, so it’s very easy for many to lump the two together. So I started to think how I should shoot the film using a method no one has used before. Actually, it wasn’t really a very special idea. I just thought it’d be fun to do something a little different.”
Feng Xiaogang said he regarded the work as his maiden work, and learned how to shoot circular frames from the camera people. He even spent a few million to allow the camera people to shoot a 10-minute pilot.
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook is to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact checkers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September.
On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.
She added that Facebook would keep testing its "related article" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news.
Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story
In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent, now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."
Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.
To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too.
Ah, I love archives!"
For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.
Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."
Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.
Just let it go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.
"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."
With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences.
He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney holds a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"

All large energy companies are “extremely wealthy”. So which energy company in the world makes the most money?
Yesterday, PFC Energy published its 2011 list of the Top 50 largest listed energy companies. US oil and gas producer ExxonMobil retained its top position with a market valuation of US$406.3 billion, closely followed by PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell.
PetroChina topped the PFC rankings twice in 2007 and 2009, while ExxonMobil ranked first place position for the other years.
Three companies from Mainland China made the 2011 Top 50 list. In addition 2nd place PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC were ranked 9th and 15th, respectively.
According to PFC’s statistics, ... Nonetheless, although current oil prices are far higher than that four years ago, PFC Energy’s CEO said that the lower combined market valuation was attributable to a number of factors, including lower North American natural gas prices, and less buoyant global stock markets.
Xinhua News Agency reported that heavily polluted weather will descend on Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and surrounding regions from the 16th and worsen by the 19th. The AQI of three cities in Hebei, namely Shijiazhuang, Xinji and Handan, will be dramatically high.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
There is going to be new US immigration plan to modify Green Card rules, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the president.
The draft law is due to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do this by changing the way the US issues Green Cards to citizens from other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, have financial resources to support themselves and show skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
The inaugural China Fireworks and Firecracker Safety and Environmental Protection Expo will be held in Liuyang on May 29.
The two-day event will be focused on the theme “Technology, Safety, Environmental Protection”. Then, the most advanced fireworks and firecracker machinery, the safest and most environmental friendly fireworks and firecracker raw and auxiliary materials as well as new products in China’s fireworks and firecracker industry will gather at Liuyang.
A large number of experts and entrepreneurs will be invited to this Expo to carry out academic exchanges in the fireworks and firecracker industry, and to share the latest technological achievements on fireworks and firecracker safety and environmental protection.
In particular, the exhibition for mechanized equipment for the production of fireworks and firecrackers as well as safe and eco-friendly products will be held at Dayao Town. Key exhibits include technologically sophisticated mechanical equipment that uses explosive substances to produce fireworks and firecrackers that have been appraised by relevant technology and passed safety verification; low sensitivity, low blast and other safe pyrotechnic compositions; as well as sulfur-free, light smoke and other safe and eco-friendly personal fireworks and firecrackers.
Meanwhile, safe and eco-friendly fireworks and firecracker products used for fireworks displays collectively sponsored by 16 Liuyang fireworks enterprises will be carried out in two phases - product selection and product fireworks display. Excellent new products that passed the early stage of the competition will be used for the fireworks displays at the Liuyang Fireworks Viewing Platform and the Gold Beach Display Site on May 29.
When 2017, which was just around the corner, was mentioned, Zhao Lei said, “After the tour ends next year, I want to go away and be alone to take stock for a while, and write more new works.”
For the purposes of optimizing the environment of scenic areas, and building a beautify Nanyue, the “636” voluntary service team of the Nanyue District Tobacco Monopoly Administration (Branch Company) carried out a “hiking to protect our forests and love our hometown” environmental protection event.
The event received the support of all the cadres and staff of the district Tobacco Administration, and also attracted retired cadres as well as the staff’s families, who came to participate in the environmental protection activities. Three generations of people from the elderly to children worked together, hiked up the mountain to protect the forests, and cleaned up rubbish, contributing their own effort to building a “beautiful Nanyue”.
This voluntary service event was aimed at protecting the scenic resources of Nanyue, and propagating the voluntary service concept of “care for others, care for society, and care for nature”. It also served to teach and pass on to the next generation the virtue of voluntary service.
It is understood that since the “636” voluntary service team was founded in early April this year, the 16 members have carried out a series of voluntary service activities including visiting needy retail customers, helping tobacco farmers care for tobacco leaves, and making donations to the Ya’an earthquake victims, and have become a team of committed voluntary service activists that convey positive energy from their hearts.

The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.
Yep.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.
"People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.
But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness.
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality," the True Companion website enthuses.
So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.
She also has moods during the day just like real people!
She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real, human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the rapey connotations of making a move on Frigid (read: resistant) Farrah, are the most concerning.
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.
However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.
Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture.
But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.
And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.
There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.
Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, pointedly, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.
They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out.
They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.
They are pleasant slaves, in other words.
Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.
“The Great Wall” tells the story of a Chinese elite troop in ancient times that battled valiantly against the monster Taotie on the world renowned Great Wall of China.
The last episode of “Hurry Up, Brother” Season 4 has been recorded. Deng Chao, leader of the “Running Man Team” was interviewed via WeChat by the reporters of Shenyang Evening News and syd.com on May 30. From “Super Scholar” in “Running Man” to “Funny Villain” in “Devil and Angel” to “Decadent Guy” Chen Mo, the impression Deng Chao gives to the audience is that of a “flexible transformer”, constantly changing.
Deng Chao said, “I won’t do the same thing over and over again in my acting career. I want to renew myself constantly.”
Trump's great feat?
Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.
Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.
Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it carries significant risks.
The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.
When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal.
There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump "normalises" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable.
I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.
The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting.
So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.
In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while, wearily, I gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars.
Oscar Pistorius taken from jail to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has left jail for a hospital visit.
Last year he was taken to the hospital for treatment to cuts on his wrists, which prison authorities said he sustained after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter verdict.

Two Bulgarians Were Detained For Illegal Camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Foreign Affairs Ministry announced, quoted by bTV.

On May 18, the Ministry of Finance issued the “Administrative Measures for Special Rewards and Subsidies for the Structural Adjustments of Industrial Enterprises”, and will arrange special rewards and subsidies amounting to a total of RMB100 billion to help advance reduction of overcapacity in the coal and steel industries.
Recently, many local governments including that of Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang have proposed reform opinions on reducing overcapacity.
In particular, many provinces have even proposed to actively lobby the Central Government for fiscal support to reduce overcapacity in their respective provinces.
One proof is that the overcapacity reduction target for coal announced by a mere eight provinces already account for 90% of the coal overcapacity reduction plan nationwide.
At an interview with reporters, Lin Boqiang, Dean of China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at Xiamen University, believed that merely relying on the Central government’s RMB100 billion to “reduce overcapacity” in the steel and coal industries is far from sufficient. More funds should come from local governments and enterprises. How should that be done?
In the detailed implementation rules for reducing surplus coal capacity issued recently by Shanxi Province, it was proposed that Shanxi Coking Coal Group should be restructured and transformed into a state-owned capital investment company, its assets and businesses should be reorganized and consolidated, and a new business model constructed.
The actual funding gap could be 3 times that of the subsidy. Earlier, Yin Weimin, Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, said that initial calculations showed that a total of 1.3 million employees in the coal industry and 500,000 in the steel industry were required to be resettled as a result of “reducing overcapacity”.

Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.
Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.
Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'
He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.
Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.
However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.
"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.
"I will be happier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me."
The global spree of frigates building If China does not build this type of warships, will it fall behind?
With the recent announcement of the construction of new types of frigates by major naval powers in the world, it seems that frigates have become the focus of attention of the major naval powers overnight. First, Japan has decided to purchase two new frigates in the 2018 annual defense budget, finally making a substantial breakthrough for its DEX frigates program. Later, Lockheed Martin of USA recently published the latest arrangement for the United States FFG frigates program. How about China's plan for building new type of frigates?
With the launching of the latest model of 054A frigate at the end of 2017, the number of 054A frigate has reached 29, approaching the sum of the 053H series frigates. Since the first 054A was launched in 2006, the history of building 054A has extended to 12 years. Building such a large number of high-performance general purpose frigates is very rare in the history. Apart from China, the only comparable accomplishment was made by the United States in the 1970s and 1980s when it built a host of 'Perry' class frigates.
And the reason why it is necessary to build so many 054A frigates is simple, that is, it is affordable, easy to operate, and doing so can make up for the deficiency of Chinese Navel that has beset the Naval for many years.
The 054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese Navy for many years thanks to its high cost performance and good combat effectiveness. With a displacement of 4,000 tons, the warship is equipped with a 76-mm main gun, and shared launching system for 32 HQ-16 and Fish-8 anti-submarine missiles, 8 YJ-83 anti-ship missiles and 1 Z-9 helicopter. Although it was first built in 2006 and was designed even earlier, its combat effectiveness is not too bad even by today's standard. It can be ranked as medium- to high level frigate among all the frigates in the world.
However, it is a warship designed at the beginning of the 21st century after all. Armaments aside, its propulsion system and electronic radar system lag significantly behind the current mainstream frigates in the world. Considering that similar frigates in Europe have been equipped with full electric propulsion, small multi-function phased array radars and large helicopter decks, it is time to develop new models.
Then how should China develop its new frigates? This has a direct bearing on its future orientation and the strategic direction of Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will inevitably aim at becoming the blue water navy, roaming in the vastness of the oceans. It should be able to deploy rapidly in areas that are closely related to China’s vital interests and demonstrate the presence of force. If necessary, it will use powerful combat capabilities to ensure that China’s vital interests in the region are not compromised. So, it seems that the new models of frigates will surely be huge ships that can roam the blue water.
Let's look at the positioning of the new frigates in the future rank and file of Chinese Navy. The future Chinese Navy should be similar to the US Navy. In addition to the necessary offshore defense ships, the other main ships will form an aircraft carrier battle group or amphibious attack group as the situation requires.
The new frigates in the future aircraft carrier battle group should play the primary role in anti-submarine and short-range air defense operations. In the amphibious attack group, they should provide protection to ships. According to these requirements, the new frigates must have strong anti-submarine capability and good mid-range air defense capability.
Based on the above positioning, we can boldly imagine the rough appearance of the new frigates in the future.
First, the displacement will be increased significantly compared to the current 054A model. It is estimated that the displacement of the new frigate will reach about 5000-6000 tons. The ship will be equipped with a comprehensive electric propulsion system that combines a QC280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines, improving the maximum speed to around 30 knots and significantly increase the cruise range. As for the weaponry, the 76mm main gun and 1130 near-range anti-aircraft gun will be retained, but a HQ-10 launch system will be added. A shared vertical launching system for 32-48 unit HQ-16 modified missile and Fish-8 missiles will be furnished at the back of the main gun. A large 8-16-unit vertical launching system should be furnished at the middle-to-rear section of the hull for the launch of YJ-18 and new cruise missiles. Hangars and parking platforms will also be expanded for the parking and storage of two 10-ton helicopters. As for the electronic radar systems, the high grade model will be equipped with a small four-sided fixed phase-control array radar developed based on 346A. the low grade model will be furnished with multi-function rotating phased array radar similar to the ones on European frigates.
Thus, the overall level of the new frigates will edge into the world's top bracket, even comparable to the FFG frigates of the USA.
Of course, these are only the author's conjecture on domestically produced new frigates. Only when the new frigates are launched into the water can we know the truth. Let's anticipate the day.

In recent years, our city has encouraged enterprises to actively participate in the construction of national or industry standards as well as regional group standards. An award of RMB300,000 will be given to enterprises that are principals or that participate in formulating standards for the Made in Zhejiang team, and RMB500,000 awarded to enterprises that have passed the Made in Zhejiang brand certification. This is the most generous award given out in the Province, and has incentivized enterprises to benchmark themselves against the standards.
Recently, at the production workshop of Wonly Group, Gao Jian, head of the Group’s companies, and its staff were working together to pack and send a burglar-proof door to Shaoxing Quality Inspection Center as a sample for the Made in Zhejiang team’s benchmarking and standard achievement work.
Just a couple of days ago, Wonly had passed the on-site inspection of the “Made in Zhejiang” certification expert team.
Gao Jian said that the professional team made up of industry technical experts and the quality certification organization commended the Group’s performance in terms of quality excellence, proprietary innovation and other core aspects, and unanimously believed that the Group had achieved the standards in all respects. If Wonly’s product were to pass the subsequent inspection, it will become one of the first enterprises to have achieved and passed these standards.
Wonly Group is but an epitome of standards driving industry toward structural transformation.
Buyang Group and Qunsheng Group are also enterprises in the city that are carrying out the Made in Zhejiang team’s benchmarking and and standard achievement work.
Since our City formulated the Made in Zhejiang standards for the burglar-proof doors industry last year, Xinyue, Simto and other enterprises have also actively applied to undergo benchmarking.
In recent years, a flood of capital has flowed into the film and TV market, and the profile and remuneration of actors have risen rapidly. Producer He Jing once revealed that two actors of a certain hit drama which was being filmed were earning salaries of close to RMB100 million. In the end, they only acted for two days; their doubles took care of the rest of the film.
In the present situation where actors taking on roles in several dramas simultaneously is popular, lead actors and actresses would be at different sets at the same time. This has meant that they would not be able to appear at the same set at the same time. As such, film crews have been forced to use doubles to ensure the film schedule.

China's household debt ratio is close to the United States. Is being unable to repay loan more frightening than being unable to afford a home?
Recently, everyone has been talking about the recent changes in real estate policies. Is it true that real estate policies have been loosened? Is the diversification of land supply going to bring down the housing prices?
However, just when we were worried about real estate prices, macroeconomic controls and the future trend of the real estate market, the People's Daily published an important commentary once again. Last time we discussed how People’s Daily had set the tone for the regulation of real estate market through a commentary. This time, the commentary of People's Daily deals with a topic that is more serious than the affordability of housing: can you repay the loan even if you can afford the down payment of a mortgage?
Today, let's discuss the question more serious than buying a house: repay the loan.
I. China's growing housing debt crisis
The People's Daily Overseas Edition published a commentary titled “Awards and Loans: The Joy and Worries of Struggling Young People” on January 17th. The article cited some data from an report on the progress of nationwide financial deleveraging in the 3rth quarter jointly published by the National Laboratory of Finance and Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center in November 2017. According to the report, the leverage ratio of the residents' sector continues to climb, rising from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, an increase of 1.3%, which amounts to an increase of 3.8% in the first three quarters of 2017.
The residents sector accounts for an increasing share of the total debt in the real economy, and the leverage ratio has risen rapidly.
Relevant studies have shown that Chinese households' debts in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, which account for about two-thirds of residents' debts, which is about twice that of business loans.
Among the consumer loans, medium- and long-term loans dominated by housing loans accounted for about 80%, but short-term consumer loans grow faster than medium- and long-term loans.
Moreover, the household debt ratio figure obtained in the study is only reflects the total amount of credit that the household sector obtains from financial institutions. In fact, many Chinese households borrow money from private sources including relatives and friends, creating a large amount invisible loans.
Seeing such data, one cannot help but be stupefied. According to the statistical data of Suning Financial Research Institute, the leverage ratio of Chinese households was only 3% in 1996 and 18% in 2008. But this figure doubled in just six years since the trend of rapid growth of leverage ratio set in, reaching 36.4%. By the third quarter of 2017, the leverage ratio of households has reached 48.6%.
Let's make another comparison. In May last year, HSBC issued an investigation report involving 10,000 respondents in 9 countries.
The investigation was targeted at young people in the millennial generation (born between 1980 and 2000) in nine countries.
The report pointed out that China's young people who were born in 1980s and 1990s have a home ownership rate of 70%, far ahead of Mexico at the second place (46%), and twice the US level (35%).
These figures reveals that compared to the problem of being unable to afford homes, the biggest risk of 'Grey Rhinoceros' for Chinese residents at present is likely to be being unable to repay debt.
2. Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have analyzed previously, although we have been saying that China’s housing prices are relatively high, China’s housing ownership rate is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world. So the urgent question facing a lot of friends is whether you can replay the loan rather than the question of whether you can afford a home.
A quick review of the real estate market in the world leads to the conclusion that China’s real estate market hasn't experience major crisis except for the localized crisis in Hainan Province as we mentioned before. This is because commercialization of property is a relatively recent phenomenon in China. However, it's alarming to note that the real estate crisis in the United States triggered a global financial tsunami in 2008, just a decade ago.
The blame for the real estate crisis in the United States falls on two financial institutions: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
In the so called 'golden age' of the United States, real estate companies sold their houses with very low down payments to the low-income people in order to expand sales. When the US economy was prosperous, the real estate market was also thriving. However, it did not last long. The stagnation of growth in the U.S. economy caused the income of home buyers to fall, which in turn caused the consumption expenditures of a large number of households began to decline.
Most U.S. families had both financial assets and real estate assets. At that time, almost all household assets of the low-income families were real estates, while the majority assets of the top 20% high-income families were financial assets. As a result, poorer people in the United States have higher debt ratio.
A grave reality is that these people bought their houses when the economy was prosperous, so the money to pay the mortgage is also calculated based on their better income. When the income declined, the pressure on the mortgage increased as a result of floating nature of some subprime mortgage plans. Thus, the real estate problems of these American families gradually evolved into a real estate crises.
Some people cannot afford to pay their mortgages because their incomes were too low. The banks began to take over the houses from the home buyers who had defaulted on the loan, and then sold them at very low prices, resulting in a step-by-step price fall in the area. This vicious cycle caused a further decline in housing prices. When the housing prices had fallen to a certain extent, more and more home buyers found that their house values became lower than their loans. Thus, more and more people stopped repaying their home mortgages, resulting in a large number of bad debts.
In this way, a huge vicious circle formed:
“Economy downturn – incomes fall – some people can’t repay mortgages – banks sell defaulted houses at low prices – house prices fall – more people stop paying home mortgages – banks sell houses again – prices fall again ..."
The problem did not stop there. As house prices continue to fall, a new situation emerged: The money the bank got after auctioning the defaulted house was less than the loan the home buyer owed the bank, the home buyer still need to repay the loan. So stopping repayment does not necessarily mean that you are cleaned of the debt. For example, if you paid a down payment of $600,000 and borrowed $2.4 million to buy a house worth $3 million at the time. When the house price falls to $2 million, you stop to repay the loan and give the house to the bank. After the bank auctions the house, you will not only lost your down payment of $600,000, but also owed $400,000 debts to the bank. You still have to repay the debt.
Thus, with the effect of such vicious cycle one after another, the U.S. economy gradually collapsed and eventually triggered the U.S. financial crisis in 2008.
Therefore, the fact that China’s household debt ratio has reached a high level of 46.8% is a problem that requires great vigilance. Although this figure is still lower than that of developed countries at present, the signs of the problem have already begun to emerge. The central government started to stress the issue of deleveraging repeatedly in the last year, which is a very prescient judgment. If the household debt ratio is allowed to continue to climb, it will inevitably lead to a huge crisis. Therefore, we must strictly guard against the hidden financial risks.
It's no wonder that the central government has set the tone for the real estate market: Houses are for living, not for speculation. The government are taking multiple measures to resolve potential risks, including increasing land and housing supply and encouraging house renting.
For our individual families, we must abandon the mindset of speculating on real estate and make purchase according to our own financial capacities. In this way, we can prevent our families from falling under huge financial burden. A reasonable assessment of one's own income and debt levels is essential for healthy growth of family wealth.

Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to a medical standard.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted for cats and dogs, and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also alter locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, for a cost of £300 each lock.
The married father of one now has technology fitted to both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.

White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.
The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.
"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.
A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."
It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."
Brilliant Metaphors of Xi Jinping about Comprehensively Strengthening Party Discipline
During the second plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech on January 11, emphasizing that “we should keep marching ahead on the road of adhering to the principle of comprehensively strengthening party discipline and creating a new situation for comprehensively strengthening party discipline”.
With respect to comprehensively strengthening party discipline, General Secretary Xi Jinping has given many vivid and impressive metaphors, so let’s review them together!
We should fight against “tigers” (high-ranking corrupt officials) immediately after we find evidence, and we should also deal with those “flies” (low-ranking corrupt officials) at the same time. We should spread the principle of comprehensively strengthening party discipline to grass-roots party organizations and make every effort to deal with those corruption problems in daily life of the general public.
-- On January 11, 2018, Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech during the second plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China
Officials responsible for discipline inspection and supervision at all levels should be loyal and determined, responsible, discipline and law-abiding, honest and upright in order to ensure that the power granted by the Party and the people will not be abused, and the sharp sword used for praising virtue and punishing vice will never be covered by dust.

-- During December 25 and 26, 2017, Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech at the meeting of democratic life held by Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC
Our comrades from the Political Bureau should learn about history and be reasonable and must not confuse public and private interests, call white black, blur the boundary between righteousness and benefits or handle issues based on nepotism. You should erect a “wind vane” by taking the lead in adhering to honesty and self-discipline and help establish a work style for the party characterized by honesty and integrity.

-- From the speech delivered by Xi Jinping at the National Organization Working Conference on June 28, 2013
A blacksmith must have necessary skills in order to do his job in a great way.

-- On October 18, 2017, Xi Jinping pointed out the following during the 19th CPC National Congress
Leading cadres at all levels should take the lead in implementing the Codes and Rules, hold the “steering wheel” in exercising power and fasten the “safety belt” for ensuring integrity. In addition, they should also make efforts to eliminate vice and exalt virtue, strengthen resistance against corruption and eliminate evil factors, perform their duties in creating an honest and upright political ecology and make their contributions during the process.
-- On March 8, 2017, Xi Jinping emphasized the following during review of the Sichuan Delegation at the 5th session of the 12th National People's Congress

Afghan democracy depends on political role for women, U.N. says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the U.N. Assistance Mission said hundreds of women are running in provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly-registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible when women fully participate and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections take place April 5.
The Taliban has issued threats against an election process that coincides with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role.

This made Aunt Gao and her family, residents of the Machinery Office dormitory at Minzhu Road in Nanning, very happy.
Neighbors also said that flowers blooming on the money tree is a rare sight. Residents of the housing estate felt that this was very auspicious, and came to take a look out of interest after learning about the matter.
The scientific name for the money tree is “Malabar Chestnut”, a tropical plant native to Mexico. It performs best in warm and damp conditions, and its flowers will only bloom under appropriate conditions such as sunlight, water and nutriments.
Even in the wild where tropical conditions are appropriate, flowers blooming on money trees are rare. It was once said that the “chance of flowers blooming is one in a thousand”.
Yesterday morning, reporters visited the Nanning Machinery Office dormitory at Minzhu Road. Led by Aunt Gao, the reporters saw the money tree.
Planted amid the flower bed of the housing estate, the money tree was about five meters tall, and the branch circumference, at its thickest, measured approximately 30 cm. Its leaves were emerald green and luxuriant.
The flowers bloomed at tips of higher branches, and the flowers that were in full bloom were more than 10 cm wide. The delicate pale yellow filaments were evenly spread out, and the green buds, when burst, curled backwards on both sides. The fine and dense stamens resembled silver threads with gold stars at their tips.
Aunt Gao told the reporters that the money tree has been planted for eight years. When it was first planted, it was about one meter tall; it is now more than five meters tall.
It was originally a potted plant when her son first bought it from the flower and bird market, and was subsequently planted in the flower bed. She did not have to take particular care of it, but would occasionally earth it up.

Shichang Xingbao reported that between 2005 and 2011, the GDP of Anhui Province rose from joint “bottom” to second at one stroke.
However, the Province’s economic growth continued to experience difficulties such as low investment efficiency, and a lack of core competitiveness in its industrial economy. To this end, the latest issue of the “Economic Blue Paper” of the Province’s Economic Information Center advised raising the quality and benefit of economic growth.
We have made a comparison of some of the representative indices of the Province’s economy between 2005 and 2011 with that of the nation and Central China.
In 2011, in terms of industrial economic benefit, high energy consumption industries such as industrial energy and raw materials, which comprised a relatively large proportion of the Province, had to endure “twin pressures” - they were significantly affected by market volatility as well as overcapacity. At the same time, home appliances, automotive and other leading industries lacked innovation, resulting in slim profits.
Meanwhile, enormous investment did not bring about the corresponding economic benefit, which was a key factor leading to poor quality and benefit in economic growth.
As regards this, experts advised that effective measures should be adopted to incentivize enterprises to innovate. The technical outcomes of Institutions of higher learning and technological research institutes should also be promptly “transferred” to enterprises.
As for low industrial economic benefit, experts said that industry merger and reorganization should be actively advanced, industry structure optimized, and the industry chain extended.

GMB concern over investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.
It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
China News Service Tibet, May 11 wire (Chen Taobin) Nyima Tsering, Deputy Director of the Tibet Autonomous Region Sports Bureau said at the Everest North Base Camp on the 10th that the cleaning up of domestic waste on the northern slope of Mount Everest will move from a public interest action in the past toward a normalized action led by the Chinese government and in which the international community will participate.
On May 10, environmental protection volunteers loaded rubbish that have been sorted onto trucks.
China News Service/He Penglei: In the last 10 years or so, environmental protection issues at Mount Everest have become increasingly prominent as the number of Mount Everest explorers and tourists increased significantly.
In the Spring of 1997, the Tibet Autonomous Region Mountaineering Association initiated the first clean-up on the Northern slope of Mount Everest, cleaning up oxygen tanks and other domestic waste left over from the 1960s and 1970s. This video was also specially broadcast at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto that year, drawing world attention.
According to Nyima Tsering, after 1997, public interest groups arrived successively to help clean up the Northern slope of Mount Everest, but most of the participants were non-professionals.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.
Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.
By staff reporter Wang Yichen: The International Conference on Renewable Energy Development and Technology jointly organized by State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) and the International Electrotechnical Commission was held in Frankfurt, Germany recently.
At present, accelerating the development of renewable energy, and advancing transformation toward clean and low-carbon energy have become a global trend.
However, large-scale development and use of renewable energy continued to be assailed by system security, long-distance delivery, technology economic and other issues and challenges that need to be confronted and resolved.
SGCC Chairman Shu Yinbiao revealed that the company was in the process of planning to expand the size of the synchronous power grid so as to strengthen the existing regional power grid interconnection. By 2020, inter-regional power transmission capacity will increase to about 300 million kW.
Our staff reporter learned at the beginning of August that in the first half of the year, it was understood that operations of certain wind turbines being suspended in wind farms was a fairly common phenomenon in the “three northern” wind power regions.
Yancheng’s renewable energy such as wind power and PV, accounts for 70% of Jiangsu’s total. Renewable energy developed along the coast is produced and consumed locally, and has displayed enormous advantages and potential in Yancheng.
January 3 news: Reporters learned from the Guangzhou Flower Market Office yesterday that the Spring Festival flower market will begin receiving bids for the 2008 Spring Festival flower market soon.
Huadu District held tenders for the tangerine and flower booths on the 29th and 30th last month, respectively.
Guangzhou Yuexiu Archives Bureau is organizing and collecting hundreds of historic old photos of Spring Festival flower markets (photographed some 50 to 60 years ago), and will publicly exhibit them at the Yuexiu Culture Artistic Center on January 8, 2008. When the flower markets are being constructed at the end of January, the exhibition of these old photos will be moved to Grandbuy Department Store at Beijing Road.
Elsewhere, the Cultural Bureau of Yuexiu District will also hold a flower market forum, and will invite old Guangzhou leaders, folklore experts, celebrities, old residents of Beijing Road and others to come together to talk about the history and future development of Beijing Road and West Lake Road flower markets.
The flower market forum will contact Internet media to carry out online broadcast, and will conduct live interaction with residents.
In addition, online flower markets will be made accessible. By using the information networks of housing estates, brief introductions and messages about the flower markets will be sent to residents who intend to visit and shop at the Beijing Road business district and West Lake Road flower market. Residents may browse the “online flower markets” on their mobile phones.

“Made in Sichuan” renewable energy vehicles rose against the tide. Weakening fiscal subsidies, inadequate charging facilities, and ternary lithium batteries suspended from use in renewable energy passenger vehicles; in the face of prevailing upward pressures in the domestic renewable energy automobile market
In the Phase I exhibition of the 16th Western China International Fair (hereinafter referred to as “WCIF”), which was held between November 3 and 6, six cities and prefectures including Chengdu, Nanchong and Ya’an, exhibited their development achievements in the advanced manufacturing sector. Renewable energy vehicles shone in particular, with the launch of various new vehicles, attracting widespread attention in the industry.
At present, the domestic renewable energy automobile market is temporarily under pressure because of weakening fiscal subsidies, inadequate charging facilities, and ternary lithium batteries being suspended from use in renewable energy passenger vehicles.
However, “Made in Sichuan” renewable energy vehicles rose against the tide, and have made major forays into the passenger and commercial vehicle sub-markets. Why so confident?
Staff reporter Zhao Zeyu. Current situation: Focus on developing “top students” “Made In Sichuan” renewable energy vehicles have dominated the news lately.

Xinhua News Agency London January 9 wire (Reporter Wang Zijiang) On the 9th, UK Sport announced Great Britain’s target for next month’s Winter Olympics to be held in PyeongChang, South Korea: Win at least five medals. This would Team GB’s “best ever” target in the history of the Winter Olympics.
UK Sport is responsible for allocating funds to the various Olympic events, and for setting the medal targets for each event.
It is predicted that events UK athletes have hopes of winning a medal are snowboarding, curling, skeleton and short track speed skating.
In the last Winter Olympic cycle, UK Sport has allocated a total of GBP32 million (approximately RMB280 million) to fund training for the Winter Olympic Game events, doubled that of the funding for the Sochi Winter Olympic cycle.
Most of the funding was sourced from the National Lottery, with the balance funded by the government.
The UK has pinned its hopes for the gold medal on two people - short track speed skater Elise Christie, a triple gold medalist at last year’s world championships, and Lizzy Yarnold, the previous skeleton Olympic champion.
At the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014, Team GB won one gold, one silver and two bronzes, the best tally since the inaugural Winter Olympics in 1924.
Welsh AMs worried about 'looking like muppets'
There is consternation among some AMs at a suggestion their title should change to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are worried it could invite ridicule.
One Labour AM said his group was concerned "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh twp means daft and pwp means poo.
A Plaid AM said the group as a whole was "not happy" and has suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open minded" about the name change, but noted it was a short verbal hop from MWP to Muppet.
In this context The Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what Assembly Members are called will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which found broad support for calling the assembly a Welsh Parliament.
On the matter of the AMs' title, the Commission favoured Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in a public consultation.
AMs are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians go to polls in referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up in a bid to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will disregard the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The Bells of St. Martin's Fall Silent as Churches in Harlem Struggle
"Historically, the old people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there's neither."
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People socialize in a different way" nowadays, he said.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people go on a regular basis."
As for churches, he worries that the money from selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect it to, "and sooner or later they'll be right back where they started."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining sanctuaries.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will hasten the day that these churches close altogether because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been worshiping nearby took title to the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild, they commissioned the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has played out at St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the parish's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would seek to pass along the costs" to the vestry, even though the vestry had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent in.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the diocese's part.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was diving for lobster in California on the opening day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then paddled over with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just excitement of catching a lobster, but then he "realized that he was yelling, 'I got bit!
I got bit!'
His whole clavicle was ripped open," Hammel said he noticed once he got to the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added the victim sustained traumatic injuries to his upper torso area.
Officials shut down beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans push into UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is taking on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty aisles staffed with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial push into the UK's £2.8bn beauty market, which is continuing to grow while fashion and homeware sales fall back, the larger beauty aisles will be tested out in 11 stores around the country and taken to more stores next year if it proves a success.
The investment in beauty comes as supermarkets hunt for ways to use up shelf space once sued for TVs, microwaves and homeware.
Sainsbury's said it would be doubling the size of its beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop will be testing out concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week while a second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said the outlets will look increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has bolstered grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist's stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago.
It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every need and the alluring environment and convenient locations mean we're now a compelling beauty destination which challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left 'furious' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The pair's business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning presenter, 37, took to Instagram to announce she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons" Den star Peter Jones fuming by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own new bumper contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when TV's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
As Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly, Jones jetted out of Britain to head for one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far the top of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be her long-term future that would see her through the next couple of decades.
Her decision to pull out left everyone involved absolutely stunned.
Nobody could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow HQ which are ready to be sold."
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is among Britain's most bankable stars, could cost the firm millions due to hefty investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and the potential for further delays to its launch.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother-of-three Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples holiday together and Jones has a 40 per cent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We wouldn't comment on his business affairs."
Tough talk 'and then we fell in love'
He joked about criticism he would get from the news media for making a comment some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his mock "news anchor" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly Saturday that the North doesn't see a "corresponding response" from the U.S. to North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping up pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - ending rocket tests, helping free hostages and getting the remains of American servicemen returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing at the crowd directly in front of him.
Indonesia Tsunami and Quake Devastate an Island, Killing Hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for instance, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Even though more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had been dislocated, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've been very clear that they're not requesting international assistance, so it's a bit challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the national disaster agency spokesman, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Given the earth shaking that Indonesia constantly endures, the country remains woefully underprepared for nature's wrath.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though a warning had been in effect, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At the best of times, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's tattered infrastructure a centerpiece of his election campaign, and he has lavished money on roads and railways.
But funding shortfalls have plagued Mr. Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands dislocated from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battled on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other crude weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge dips deep equalizer vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while about 30 yards out from the Chelsea goal with his team trailing 1-0.
He tapped the ball to his left before scooping a shot toward the far post.
The attempt sailed high above the box as it drifted toward the right top corner of the net.
The ball eventually dropped over a leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to get on the ball and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and took one touch and didn't think about it too much and just took the shot on."
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after getting a score in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker heeled a pass back to Mateo Kovacic on that play, before spinning off near midfield and sprinting into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic did a quick give-and-go at midfield.
He then fired a beautiful through ball, leading Hazard into the box.
Hazard outran the defense and finished into the far post netting with a left footed shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool battles Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has climbed to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings brought down in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake which struck Friday and triggered waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was strewn with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55am with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man being arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages but I would appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also appeal to anyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have captured anything on dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information which is vital to our investigation.'
A police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was found is local to Birkenhead and she was found inside a property.
This afternoon friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police have said they are in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back into his flat but is being told by police no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what happened.
Residents are now being told it will be hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
She keeps repeating 'it's so awful'.
At 2pm two police vans were inside the cordon with another van just outside.
A number of officers were stood inside the cordon monitoring the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting log 247 of 30th September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit by 'rewriting history' row
Its banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as "folly" and "attempting to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure who many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a wholly accurate representation is the subject of continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Killer Pig Mauls Chinese Farmer to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a sty at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a hoggery on May 30, 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The following morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to a neighbouring pig sty open.
He said that in the sty was a large male pig with blood on its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550 pound hog had mauled the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mangled," the cousin, referred to by his surname "Wu," said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Though rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years previously, a 650 pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
"They're just being playful.
They're nippers, very inquisitive ... they aren't out to hurt you.
You just have to pay them the right amount of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remnants to bring widespread heavy rain to southwest US
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rains across northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 Hurricane, as of 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is beginning to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move east toward the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm it will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash flooding, debris flows and possibility landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in spots, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Flash flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely ill advised to venture out into the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain could cause canyons to become raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring locally gusty winds and blowing dust.
The approaching trough will bring some locally heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Rainfall totals of over half an inch are possible, which could cause minor debris flows and slick roadways.
This would be the region's first rainfall of their wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread into the Four Corners on Tuesday and last through Wednesday.
October can see some intense temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a great example of dramatic temperature differences through the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is nearly a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, lingering summer warmth will try to build and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm start to October with widespread 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long term climate forecast is indicating high chances for above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's gripping testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political standoff continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute twist: an agreement engineered by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh groped her drunkenly and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in impassioned testimony, said he's 100 percent certain that it didn't happen.
It's likely that more than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched it.
The company was counting average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures weren't immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices.
To put that in perspective, that's an audience size similar to that for a playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts have strongly backed Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would be voting in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught be CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being shouted at by protesters as he tried to ride an elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with eyes downcast for several minutes as he was berated, televised live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "you have power when so many women are powerless.""
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks were all covering live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the nominee for the next week, which minority Democrats have been urging.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, because it was evident Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to the one with her on the newspaper's front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack of her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "entirely preposterous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and booked into prison on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to fatally shooting Wayde.
His bond has been set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head into the neck.
The department is crediting the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and area citizens in assisting in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for its "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about at all times," Wade said.
Volcano spews ash on Mexico City
Ash spewing from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater and it registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center was monitoring multiple rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash coating car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano that sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police pelted them with eggs and hurled powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that would usually be thronged with tourists.
Scuffles also broke out later in the day with police using their batons to contain the fighting.
Over several hours pro-independence groups chanting "No forgetting, no forgiveness" faced off with unionist protesters shouting, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests, local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters chose overwhelmingly to become independent, though turnout was low with those against secession largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote going ahead at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration went ahead but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we lived through one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy at being able to vote but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite managing a vital if narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to retain momentum this year with many of their best known leaders either in self imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic recording the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial jail since late last year, announced he would run in European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house rammed by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga strike gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Promoted Livingston stunned Rangers to consign Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference as Gary Holt's side moved level with Hibernian in second.
Gerrard's side remain without an away win in the Premiership this season and face leaders Hearts, who they trail by eight points, next Sunday.
Before then, Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston miss chances against blunt visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their directness causing Rangers all manner of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his effort across the face of goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his effort wide after sliding in to meet Craig Halkett's header across goal.
The hosts were content to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could trouble the visitors at set pieces.
And that was the manner in which the crucial goal came.
Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston worked an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining to set up Menga, who took a touch and scored from the centre of the box.
By that stage, Rangers had dominated possession but had found the home defence impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely untroubled,
That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos did force a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow flicked wide from another Livingston set play.
Crosses continually came into the Livingston box and were continually cleared, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were waved away.
'Phenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and personnel has scarcely changed since their return to the top flight, but great credit has to go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, marshalling a superbly-organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
Rangers were short of inspiration, though.
As good as they have been at times under Gerrard, they fell well short of those standards.
Their final ball was lacking - only once did they cut the home side open - and it is something of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in mid-table.
Erdogan get mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at repairing relations beteen the NATO allies.
They've fallen out over issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but plenty of supporters turned out nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The dueling protests reflect the divisiveness of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and reviled as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road crash: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision involving a car in London.
The crash happened near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics attended, but the man died at the scene.
The crash comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his next-of-kin.
Road closures and bus diversions are in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers hurt in disorder
Six prison officers have been injured in a disturbance at a high security men's jail, the Prison Office has said.
Disorder broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involves eight inmates and is contained to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June it was reported that the prison's governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flash Flooding (Drought Areas May Benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy tracks across the Desert Southwest, delivering flash flooding risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct path over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals up to 4 inches possible.
For those out of flash flood risk, Rosa's rain may be a blessing since the region is drought-stricken.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this rainfall will likely be beneficial since the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to landfall across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore powering down.
Thus, it's expected to make landfall in Mexico at tropical storm strength in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rainfall across portions of Mexico could be heavy, posing a significant flooding risk.
"Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then track north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then track up through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main hazard expected from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce life-threatening flash flooding and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four attempted murder arrests
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officers have appealed for anyone who may have any mobile phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered, the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegation.
The President said on Saturday that the "American people saw the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with a sterling record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President obliquely referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian quake, tsunami, with toll seen rising
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away as giant waves crashed onto beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying anything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before striking the shoreline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in statement the energy released by Friday's massive quake was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War Two.
The geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and the damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications "were totally crippled with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," it said.
The agency on Saturday was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water crashes onto the shore, carrying away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending in cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still badly need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia Tsunami Toll Soars Above 800.
It Is Very Bad.
While World Vision's staff from Donggala have made it safely to Palu city, where employees are sheltering in tarpaulin shelters set up in the courtyard of their office, they passed scenes of devastation on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw lots of houses that were destroyed," he said.
It is very bad.
Even as aid groups began the grim motions of starting the gears of disaster relief, some complained that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staffing from overseas can only start flowing if the site of a calamity is declared a national disaster zone.
That has not happened yet.
"It's still a province level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can open for international assistance but there's no status yet."
As the second night fell on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing were holding out hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that leaven the bleak story lines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was plucked from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been pinned under rubble for two days with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which wrapped up earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse circulated among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who were taking part in the beach festival.
His messages, though, only resulted in one gray check mark, rather than a pair of blue checks.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The car's driver had been emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
While he was occupied, another man "ran up from behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money meant for delivery.
Witnesses spotted multiple suspects fleeing the scene, according to the release, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show who cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
As well as being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye - just being a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers to change their name.
Sean Combs has been variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has also made do with or without a hyphen and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never ever use the military to repress the Mexican people."
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration at the plaza on Oct. 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities draws youth to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, even as the U.S. overall lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it's aiming to be No.1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so much farther behind U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard in order to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that is taking away the academic leaders; it's the corporates," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said immigration policy changes could also help the U.S. bolster its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should automatically be offered to PhD's in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations dole out money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is meant to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen action in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which had blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entrance into NATO and the EU.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not be voting in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubts on whether turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to pursue admission into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so they can be live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the vote's outcome to make it decisive.
The name change would requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, turnout stood at only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters cast their ballot.
"I came out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their ballot for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that would open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and pulling up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the service door" Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we do have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the huge majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He said that a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful turnout needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first serious blow to policy of the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through entire Brighton defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling dispatched of the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass at midfield at the start of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, before slashing into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one defender before outrunning several more at the edge of the Brighton box.
He then pushed a pass to his left, finding Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We spoke about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal in that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League scuffle.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in Brighton territory on that play.
He sent a beautiful through ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling toward the far post.
The Sky Blues forward tapped the ball into the net just before sliding out of bounds.
City battles Hoffenheim in Champions League group play at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler vs. Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there wasn't much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched at least a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock up their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to toe the rubber knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team would be playing at probably the highest level of any point I would face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be making his 34th start, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and would be pitching on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
The President obliquely referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"All of what we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by using any means necessary, you see the meanness, the nastiness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And you see that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and nasty and untruthful."
He referenced Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein by name, which received loud boos from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I wait one - that was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant of those who speak their minds
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censure me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I'm the latest in a line of Labour MPs to be told we are not welcome - all for speaking our minds.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely stood up to antisemitism.
In my case, the censure motion criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the Friday night GC meetings have been exactly that.
Sadly today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics has long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.
It has become increasingly apparent that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared a similar political outlook began expecting me to do a U-turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed with - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there follows a tirade of abuse on social media calling for deselection, denouncing the politics of the centre, telling me I should not be in the Labour party.
And that is not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues as the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normalised.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is we are no longer that broad church and with every "no-confidence" motion or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower.
I have had lots of advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so vocal and then I would "be all right."
But that is not what I came into politics to do.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literally falling down, I've sought to champion better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I would say is that when the country is ploughing towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But really the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of deselection threats or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I believe are the best interests of you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr go top
Two late tries may have skewed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully-entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They now top the table, the only unbeaten side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defence, as much as their better chance-taking, which carried the home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"We've been tested over our games this far, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Credit to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to make numbers tell and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted try.
Climo stretched the Ayr lead with a penalty, before, right on half-time, he scored then converted a solo try to make it 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the leeway to five points.
There was then a lengthy hold-up for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was stretchered off, and from the restart, Ayr surged further ahead through a Stafford McDowall try, converted by Climo.
Ayr acting captain Blair Macpherson was then yellow-carded, and again, Melrose made the extra man pay with an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a spell of fierce pressure.
The home side came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was yellow-carded for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down at the back of the advancing Ayr maul.
Climo converted, as he did again almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry away for the home side's fifth try.
Still Game star looks set for new career in restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran looks set to move into the hospitality industry after it was discovered he's been named as the director of a licensed restaurants company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final one in the show's run, and it appears Kiernan is planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official record listings, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was looking to get involved in Glasgow's "thriving restaurant trade."
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to Pacific
Sailors patrol a rigging-clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly an ocean-blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are daubed with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty."
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still vivid - as is the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.
Those hopes are perhaps at their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and is of course expecting with a positive view the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hopeful that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of fitful talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has plenty riding on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's favour - and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ICJ's ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates the case "wasn't complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from furthering Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have set it back.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales's belligerent rhetoric has sapped any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually speedy.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless it can trust US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow through on promises made during a summit in Singapore between the rivals' leaders.
His comments come as US. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "pipe dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first making significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest line in massive headwear on it's way to a High Street near you
If you want to upsize your hat collection or completely block out the sun then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled an array of wacky oversized head gear for their SS19 collection on the runway which dazzled the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-popping creations down the catwalk.
The stand out piece by Valentino was an over-the-top beige hat adorned with a feather-like wide brim that swamped the models heads.
Other over-sized accessories included bejeweled watermelons, a wizard hat and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks- and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn up lips and resembled more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled scuba diving gear complete with snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue the huge fashion statement- you are in luck.
Style watchers predict that the enormous bonnets could be making their way to high streets near you.
The out-sized hats come hot on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide brim that's been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that was splashed across social media sent another big creation down the catwalk - a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model toting it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringing and topped with a white leather handle, was the stand out piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I'm expecting to see large hats and beach bags arrive on the high street for next summer - as the designer has made such a huge impact it would be hard to ignore the demand for the oversized accessories.'
John Edward: Languages skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavours.
With upwards of 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a bespoke school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages continue as a popular and desired subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language that goes to his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when wanting to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are topping the league tables with the highest pass rates within independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a Higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent studying Spanish also achieved an A.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future.
Languages now, as a subject choice, are being held in the same regard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a languages skills shortage.
Therefore more and more, language skills are becoming imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they've learned a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future having a life-long skill such as this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 per cent.
This is why putting the investment into language teaching now is important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, particularly those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, whereas others will teach languages that are deemed to be most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills required to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It can't be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vitally important to the country's future, so this must be mirrored in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron to make Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is nearly over for fans looking to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But just how many minutes he'll play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers" official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers" six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a flurry of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallies in the next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote on hold for his pick to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to build support for upcoming mid-term elections since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast on Nov.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which became tense over sexual misconduct allegations with an anticipated Senate confirmation vote on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary aim of this flurry of rallies is helping Republicans facing touch November elections gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said these five rallies in the next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show stomach for fight to keep hopes alive heading into Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes might just have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept but one that players truly believe in, and never more so than at competitions like these.
So where would they say the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we are carrying that as a little bit of momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he strolled off for the day.
Europe have the advantage, of course, four points ahead with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in their sails though and they have plenty to be encouraged by, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boast three points from four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those guttural screams of celebration got louder as his round went on, sinking a crucial putt to take match four all-square when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His putt that won them the match on 15 was met with a similar scream, the sort that tells you he believes that the American team is not out of this.
"You've really just got to dig deep and worry about your own match," Spieth said.
It is all each of these players has left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's odd but adorable couple are four from four and can do no wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this boisterous crowd cements that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
Talk of European glory remains premature, though.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short work of Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never got close to climbing out of.
On Sunday, though, there is nobody to help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between pairings, the advice they give, the advice they don't and the way that a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe have played better as a team thus far and take a significant lead into the final day but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the stomach for the fight that some, especially Stateside, had been doubting.
Europe take 10-6 lead into Ryder Cup final day
Europe will take a healthy advantage into the final day of the Ryder Cup after emerging from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their tally so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, bidding to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misfiring American side in the morning fourballs, taking the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but they could not eat into the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then gelled superbly to beat a deflated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not have it al their own way though on a pleasant, breezy day south west of Paris.
Three-times major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They earned a gritty 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes having lost the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit going into the singles, although as holders Furyk's side need only draw to retain the trophy.
After being second-best for two days, however, a Sunday counter-attack looks as though it will be beyond them.
North Korea says 'no way' will disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust in the United States and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missiles tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri reprised familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first ever summit between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "denuclearization-first" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even objecting to the "declaration of the end of war,"" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the U.S., the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, heaped praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the fully, final, verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to denounce him for making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding measures."
He said Kim had told him the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take course in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has got all its undergraduates getting more sleep in a bid to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-fuelled 'all-nighters.'
An academic found students at the world's number one university are often clueless when it comes to the very basics about how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
'At the end of it one girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I only being told this now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
The hour long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is impacted by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behaviour instantly.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' Prof Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in 'pulling an all-nighter' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring you have enough sleep, of a good quality, should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, it to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as for when to wake, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can throw your circadian rhythm out of kilter, leading to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal downs Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another bout of away-day blues as Dolly Menga's strike consigned Steven Gerrard's disjointed side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted just Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points adrift of runaway Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked like levelling.
While Rangers now drop down to sixth spot, Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be further trouble in store for Rangers after linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the away end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side which swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 which took a point off Hearts last week and he would have been delighted with the way his well-drilled outfit suffocated their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored just two minutes in when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder tugged his big chance wide.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only stab wide at the back post.
Rangers did grab control but there looked to be more hope than belief about their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have had a penalty on the quarter-hour mark as he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's appeals.
Rangers managed just two first-half shots on target but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame Ovie Ejaria strike.
While Livi's 34th-minute opener may have been against the run of play, no one can deny they deserved it for their graft alone.
Again Rangers failed to deal with a deep Jacobs set-piece.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher slotted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break as he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the switch almost provided an immediate impact as the winger slotted in Morelos but the impressive Kelly raced from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to suck the visitors into playing exactly the type of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood up well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty as he tangled with Jacobs but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and COUNTING ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
A mainstay of science ever since, the Geiger Counter became a pop culture mainstay as well, as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado," starring those seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given off by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say, it sure is popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days short of his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.

One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise rogue cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West Embarked on a Pro-Trump Diatribe, Wearing a MAGA Hat, After his SNL Appearance.
It Didn't Go Well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a rambling performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town in which he was wearing a Make America Great cap, he went on a rant against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white person and they say: "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism I would've moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a skit starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's rant was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock was trying to mock West with the posting.
Also, West had complained to the audience that he had got a hard time backstage about his head wear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'don't go out there with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on: "You wanna see the sunken place?" saying that he would "put my superman cape on, because this means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments drew boos at least twice from the audience and SNL cast members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The entire studio fell dead silent."
West had been brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West got backing from head of conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE MOB."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by purchasing his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe is embracing and spewing ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the being formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change their name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge over Belfast restaurant stabbing
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington hits out at toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has hit out at the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such roles on screen mean young boys often feel like they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something's gone wrong' and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he feels 'quite strongly' about addressing the issue.
'I feel personally, quite strongly, at the moment - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?,' he said.
'What have we been teaching men when they're growing up, in terms of the problem we see now?'
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued: 'What's innate and what's taught?
What is taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes young boys feel they have to be this certain side of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that?
Because clearly something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he wouldn't be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he is 'done with battlefields and horses'.
From November Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on in,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% surge in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens who are living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year-on-year, however, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the issue.
Maxine Waters denies staffer leaked GOP senators' data, blasts 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators onto the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat asserted that the claims were being pedaled by "ultra-right wing" pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel's hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters" office and released the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests she doesn't have the temperment to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must be calm and serene."
Fleischer was appearing to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"Big if true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally liable for all of their actions that are destructible and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - underpowered Rowan Atkinson spy spoof
It's traditional now to look for Brexit significances in any new film with a British slant and that does seem applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and spluttered back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obviously rubbish we are be the nation's new export opportunity?
At any rate, the pop-eyed, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has had his licence to cock things up renewed for the second time - that name of his signalling more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemagoing territories.
He is of course the daft secret agent who despite his bizarre pretensions to smoothie glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a dollop of that chap contributing a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
He's also originally based on the traveller and international man of mystery Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos in his wake.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest JE outing.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in a medieval suit of armour and the rotor blades briefly clanging against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humour feels pretty underpowered and weirdly superfluous, especially as the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humour feels as if it is pitched at kids rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's wacky misadventures aren't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in the persona of Bean.
The perennially topical premise now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and embattled figure, already suffering a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but there's nothing much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that as every single active spy has been compromised, she will have to bring someone out of retirement.
And that means bumbling Johnny English himself, now employed as a schoolmaster in some posh establishment, but giving off-the-record lessons in how to be an undercover operative: some nice gags here, as English offers a School of Rock-type academy of spying.
English is whisked back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-suffering sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, hitched to a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of getting things terribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer woes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farcical high-jinks: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flash French restaurant; they create mayhem smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as he attempts to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are certainly pulled out for that last sequence, but as amiable and boisterous as it is, there's quite a bit of kids' TV about the whole thing.
Pretty moderate stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films I couldn't help thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies it is devising a plan for Britons to work a four day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan which will see Britons working a four day week - but getting paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same pay.
Sources said the idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
Shifting to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party pledging a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
The aspiration is currently not being endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole, however.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day working week is not party policy and it is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to claw back power from 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' at utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean current shareholders in water companies may not get back their entire stake as a Labour government could make 'deductions' on the grounds of perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand 10 per cent of private-sector firms' equity to employees, who stand to pocket annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could sway any Republican senators into pulling their support.
In an interview airing Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republicans Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could unearth anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said going into the hearing, I said, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that allegation came out, said, 'Did you do it?'
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, appears set in stone.
"My mind's made up about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everybody she names couldn't verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has it Done Anything to Decrease Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event which has a hugely impressive line-up of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which stated in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feeling like they are making a true difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing for a host of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equating to more than $37 billion that is set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or fundraised.
The group estimates the secured funds have so far made a direct impact on nearly 649 million people across the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the U.K. improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: "It'll be a long and hard path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the acts performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy for "blockade" to hamper Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy hitting the markets, including in the Middle East, US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as cited by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's engagement in Syria - notably, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is they want to broker energy just like they do in eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he has reportedly said.
And, according to to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to make sure the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to blockade, to make sure that their energy does not go to market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group which styles itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, leveraging and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
For that effect, the Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's "captive."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has drawn backlash from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Take "Hard Look" At Running For President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "hard look" at running for president following the midterm elections.
During a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she'd consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take a hard look at running for president."
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall, saying he was "taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I am worried down to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported such a run.
The poll showed more support for a run by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential run and 48 percent against it.
Other high profile Democratic names discussed in regard to a potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on Sept.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through coming back, I can relate to other families who feel ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a bit different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military, has given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence assault on a female, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum-seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions suit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang member sons," abused her but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The states' attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a bar violates that principle," the friend-of-the court brief said.
Attorneys further argued in the brief that the policy denying immigrants entry hurts the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby boy at an evacuation centre in the gutted city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking through waterlogged belongings, trying to salvage anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to continuing strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted feeling the violent earthquake shake the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's biggest selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them level rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In disseminating its propaganda, China's government is availing itself of America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's troubling economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Alienating Women Voters Ahead of Midterms With Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts Warn
As many top Republicans stand-by and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, analyst have warned they will see a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record already showing they wanted to go forward with a vote.
Those things can't be walked back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to placate angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the hallway of the Senate as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to be off the chart," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying it's already been high; that's true.
But it could be higher, particularly among swing women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who while they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.
"This has become a muddled mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's just not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be somewhat split over who to believe in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more siding with the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while just 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought forward by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they attended a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The Inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to Start a New Internet to Take on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds off of Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historical moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about the personal online data store is that it is completely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, process and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models are completely upended overnight.
"We are not asking their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross cleric celebrated
The only Church of England cleric to win a Victoria Cross during World War One as a combatant has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years on.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years on from his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the firing line and with the "greatest gallantry" led the line forward before rushing a field-gun single-handed and knocked out three of the detachment.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I know that I could never live up to but something which is humbling."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "feeling very honoured to play a part in the parade" and added "the valour of a genuine hero is being demonstrated by the support that is going to be given by a lot of people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this, you have stayed up all night to watch the a packed Bellator 206 only to be denied watching the main event.
The bill from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main card and was being shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as "some sort of sick joke."
"It's government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not suitable so they had to switch to children's programming, " said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said that they are going to work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about the replay, I think that we can probably work it out," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to work this out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when it switched over there were a lot of texts going back and forth and they all were not friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a governmental issue.
I can promise you the next time it's not going to happen.
We'll keep it down to five fights instead of six - like we normally do - and we tried to overdeliver for the fans and we just went over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he did not realise until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a number of months off because of illness.
Appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling different, have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to be able to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "caught me by surprise."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year but he said the age gap had never been an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics aged 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June, to a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his dad did not accept he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had their tickets yet for London 2012 - as he wanted to be on the front row.
"I couldn't say to him 'you're not going to be around to be on the front row dad'," he said.
"I was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he'd actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally acknowledged he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I had dreamt of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which had resonated with him in the build up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out-of-form Mickelson benched on Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to turn his form around to avoid it being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he so often has been for the United States, the five-times major winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game on the range in the hope of rectifying what ails him.
Never the straightest of drivers even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal fit for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough routinely punishes errant shots.
And if the course on its own is not daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down starting the 12 singles matches, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role that he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's got a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't envision him playing two matches.
I envisioned more, but that's the way it worked out and that's the way we thought we had to go.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furyk said his presence brought some intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, likes to poke fun at people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun having a go at him, as well, this week, which was fun to see.
He provides a lot more than just play."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizeable lead heading into the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans but only just got over the finishing line with their noses in front by the narrowest of margins, winning 14½-13½.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only just," said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everybody on that team that this is not over.
You go full bore tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over till you've got the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've said all along, I focus on the 12 players that are in our side, but we are so well aware of what's standing across on the other side - the greatest players in the world."
Delighted how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow's a different beast.
Tomorrow is the individual performances that come forward, and that is a different thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going good, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested to the full of your capacity as a golfer.
That's the message that you need to get across to players, is get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself, as well."
In contrast to Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both ends of those big last-day turnarounds, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up a loser as Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in reply to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had rallied his players heading into the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get off to that fast start like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.
When that momentum gets going one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches.
We set up our line-up accordingly and put the guys out in the fashion that we felt like, you know, we're trying to make some magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been handed the task of trying to lead the fightback and faces Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," said Bjorn of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship postponed yet again
German Navy's newest frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace ageing Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least the next year due to faulty systems and snowballing cost, local media reported.
Commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels the Navy ordered back in 2007 will come as replacement to the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood they will feature a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the cutting-edge warships - said to allow Germany to project power overseas - will already become outdated by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.
Also, it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Aside from faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also becoming an issue.
It is said to have reached staggering €3.1billion ($3.6bn) - up from initial €2.2 billion.
Problems gripping the newest frigates become especially of importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged the Navy is actually "running out of deployment-capable ships."
The official said the issue has snowballed over time, because old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of the of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
National Trust eavesdrops on secret life of bats
New research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from building and development work that affects roosts and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, roost inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We've got the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within properties as it is possible unwitting destruction of a single maternity roost could kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their roosts.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to pitch in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their populations are faring."
Ronaldo dismisses rape claims as lawyers set to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as "fake news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, named as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is alleged to have then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, slammed the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no , no.
What they said today, fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner says into the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it is part of the job.
I am a happy man and all good," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to papers filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy" let down by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the pair had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified of retaliation" and was worried about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to overturn the settlement as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing carmakers
The UK "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience once these jobs go they never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "pushed back another week" as the fight over supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby endanger Mueller's independence, has fuelled Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate judiciary committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for that hasn't been set, it could be this week, I could see that pushing back another week given all of the other things that are going on with the supreme court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some reporters would contest that assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of briefings was not due to a distaste for TV reporters "grandstanding," although she said: "I won't disagree with the fact that they grandstand."
She then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president does more Q&A sessions than any president has prior to him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."
Briefings will still happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks and that's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly takes questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week the president perhaps demonstrated why, making a freewheeling and at times bizarre appearance before gathered reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland over Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish for them to stay on post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal have continued, heading towards expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK Government has also been stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very unsettling time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Undergoes Emergency Surgery After Suffering Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just kind of collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "no details on type/extent of injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles Saturday before exiting the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK with the extra cash used to help the homeless under new Tory plans
The move will neutralise the success of Corbyn's drive to attract young voters
The stamp duty rise will be levied on those who are not paying tax in the UK
The Treasury expects it raise up to £120 million a year- to help the homeless
Foreign buyers are set to be charged a higher stamp duty rate when they buy property in the UK - with the extra cash used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract young voters with pledges to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp duty rise will be levied on individuals and firms not paying tax in the UK, with the extra money boosting the Government's drive to combat rough sleeping.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the present stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-lets - could be as much as three per cent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of new-build London properties are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder.
Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people own their first home.
He accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high by snapping up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing disgrace."
Mr Corbyn has announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy homes as hard-working British residents.
For too many people the dream of home ownership has become all too distant, and the indignity of rough sleeping remains all too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become the Scotland manager at some stage.
The Scot, 42, is relishing the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who currently sit third place in League One, three points off the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and it is always something that has drawn me back.
That opportunity would only come, though, if I am successful in club management."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no trepidation in following such established names at such a big club, having previously rejected overtures from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be gauged by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It is not an easy task to get it there, but I would probably only view myself as being successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his management career, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from the brink of relegation to Championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled, of taking charge of Alloa.
"I genuinely did believe management was the right fit for me, more so than playing.
It sounds bizarre because I did okay, made a reasonable living out of it, and enjoyed some reasonable highs.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I still go through that in terms of the stresses and pressure of the job but management just feels right.
I always wanted to manage and now I am doing it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my entire adult life."

Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday, survey finds
The summer heatwave has boosted takings for Britain's struggling pubs but heaped more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in July - but takings in restaurants were down 4.8 per cent, figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs were up 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in June just got worse in July.
Drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with like-for-likes up more than restaurants were down.
Food-led pubs also suffered in the sun, although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Across managed pubs and bars drink sales were up 6.6 per cent for the month, with food down three per cent."
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, albeit a sales drop of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we've experienced in August will provide some much-needed respite."
Total sales growth across pub and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow down in brand roll-outs.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, survey reveals
Survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed growth in "fake Insta" pages
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty per cent of pupils said they have a "main" account to show parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed a rapid growth in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty per cent of pupils said they operate a sanitised "main" account to show parents, while also having private ones.
One mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old's daughter's secret site found a teenager urging others to "rape me."
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half of those admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing so many teenagers are tempted into creating online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from her wide-ranging experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has massive respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland would benefit hugely by bringing her on to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am keen to act as a voice for athletes and I am hoping I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his total of four Olympic golds and is now a regular BBC pundit, was left unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I suffered a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover or to what degree.
Its been grueling work but made a full recovery, re-learned how to walk and today doing agility drills!
Thanks for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pump advert comparing mothers to cows divides opinion online
A breast pump company has divided opinion online with an advert that compares nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the "world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired advert to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to expressing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn of cows to a track that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see no tail" and "In case you hadn't noticed these are not udders, they're my boobs."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding them babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies."
However, the advert, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it makes light of the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision using cows to advertise this product.
Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except their babies are stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.

Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Such an out of touch advert."
Others defended the advert, with one woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious."
"I think this is a genus idea.
I would've had one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advert is a little mad but I took it for what it was.
This is a genius product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advert aimed at mums who pump (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advert praising or judging the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the group of women reveal they've all been dancing with the discreet pumps tucked in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breast-pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between expressing women and dairy cows we wanted to put breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in an entertaining and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
"Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens.
So we are continuing to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
Seeking to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported.
The longer that children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked, because of its size.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish 'occupying forces' to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" of both terror groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-wracked country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were fine for them to return, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to press ahead with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal averted a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem however stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee comprised of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections.
Moualem laid out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be restricted "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
By that logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are probably hoping, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
In what would no doubt be "The most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"
As of now, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a fire that people are being drawn to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, show runner of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would be voting for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh,"" Ms. Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story lines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Tuning out is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself on hour six of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-leather bomber jacket ("a garment thick with hubris," The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's lurid descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he is feeding you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump show's rotating cast and daily plot twists (picking a fight with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode or you're left behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't peel himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back in the day and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,"" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was sort of a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money floods into tightest midterm election House races
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of cash, thanks to a realignment of a congressional districts that landed two incumbents in a race for the same seat.
This recently redrawn suburban Pittsburg district pits Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in Republicans' favor.
The race in the new 17th has touched off a campaign finance slugfest between the major party finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow win in a widely watched in March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given Democrats a slight edge.
U.S. Weighed Penalizing El Salvador Over Support for China, Then Backed Off
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pushback from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to call back the American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement early this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for narcotics controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to go forward, effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now slated to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a signal of the import the administration places on the gathering, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next shoe to drop could be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there now is very substantial evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly also turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.
Should Congress change hands, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go again before the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
That is a lot of ifs, and I do not mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how prolonged the struggle may be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d"état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that ensued.
The course of history pivots around such inflection points, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or delayed.
Americans face several of these inflection points now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water ever since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his being unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times's account is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not full or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be in for a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me off to light Sabbath candles on that table bearing the swastika.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna clash
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to greater things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.
Maybe we could have nicked it in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better side.
Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points but that will be tough game because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push on and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself but there's a feelgood factor about the place now.
The squad's good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training's good.
Hopefully, we can push on now, put last season behind us and be successful."
Women are losing sleep over this retirement savings fear
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were speaking with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they spoke with their kids about it.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they aren't taking the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to begin.
Talk to your spouse and the kids: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't make your wishes known well ahead of time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insuring with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Hammer out your legal documents: Head off legal battles at the pass.
Get a health-care proxy in place so that you designate a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you're unable to communicate.
Also, consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You would select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure your bills get paid if you're incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions on medications and allergies?
Spell out those details in a written plan so that you're ready.
"It's not just the financials that are in play, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who will care for the dog?
Have that plan in place."
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot multiple times with an air rifle as he walked home from a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications knocked out, relief officials have not been able to get any information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The regency, an administrative region below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia sits on the seismically Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major quake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that smashed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake hit one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, triggering up tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A shallow quake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded by the devastation of the deadly 2004 quake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Major quakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance attempted to call police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone from her.
Palin is being remanded in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, reported KTUU.
He appeared in court Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, for sure" when asked his plea, reported the network.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanours, meaning he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanour, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the report of a domestic violence crime, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had alleged that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down with death tolls expected to rise in coming days.
The earthquake hit just off central Sulawesi which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami smashed on shore.
Federal prosecutors seeking rare death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclist in his path on Oct.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those counts carry a possibly death sentence, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury slapped Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight charges of murder in aid of racketeering, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried it out as "heinous, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the notice of intent states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were both put to death by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He stated to investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to 'mobilise the people's army' today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to 'feel the heat' from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK 'would have been out' by now if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The premier is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted she will push ahead with trying to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'chuck Chequers'.
He suggested Mr Farage should have been made a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand up for Brexit but we need to chuck Chequers.'
Setting out his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We didn't fight world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is completely untrue.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march, telling reporters: 'I am simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the Opposition's not going to vote for it, it's unpopular with our party and our activists who actually pound the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Please drop Chequers and start listening.'
In a pointed message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the rally politicians must be made to 'feel the heat' if they were about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'This is now about a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with doing that'.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: 'I want you to make our political class, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
'We are mobilising the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A smattering of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with a party app as the conference opened.
'These are the people who tell us they can have the IT systems in place and all of the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It is a complete farce.
There isn't such a thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to take a 'hard look' at running for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she'll take a "hard look at running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might take on Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the town hall format since Trump took office.
An attendee asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest made in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University's campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, per 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on scene, in possession of a weapon, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders hand him win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes" team orders would play a large part in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack, something which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a double-move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he held onto his tyres to target a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.
He eventually came into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman told let me by.
The team have done such an exceptional job to have a one two," said Hamilton.
That Was Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "mean and nasty and untruthful."
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is going on over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people that are angry and mean and nasty and untruthful," he said.
"When you look at releases and leaks and then they say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait one minute.
Did we leak...No, we didn't leak," he added, in an impression of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to hold it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But her denial did not appear to sit well with the president, who commented during the Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you what, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the nastiness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," Mediaite reported the president saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer hit two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars atoned for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead through strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home side level before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals secured their victory.
It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was a fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute on 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home side back into the game on 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became provider for Cownie's equaliser on 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took a lead into the first break when he hit his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard once again put them on level terms with a power play goal on 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second period and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, are at home to Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies To Ensure Hundreds On Plane Can Escape Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people made it safely off the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He stayed put to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in hospital.
Spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our heart breaks to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach the thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying that access to the the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The toll is believed to be still increasing since many bodies were still under the wreckage while many have not able to be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking all of you to work day and night to complete every tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing, after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a release that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unable to account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon short of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"That's an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and yelling, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on improving a wharf also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to shuttle people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst lays out timeline of night woman was burned alive
The prosecution rested its case Saturday in the retrial of a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined for the jury how he used cellphone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cellphones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the evening of her death, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported .
When data showed his cellphone was with Chambers' during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cellphone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim hip hop moved away from its origins of political messages and tackling social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY nanny sues couple over firing after "racist" text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a misdirected text from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny they are racist, likening the suit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when finding out that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black upon arriving for her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her gaffe, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day of work and then sent home for an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation over the firing, and is seeking compensation to the tune of $350 a day for the six-month, live-in gig she had initially been hired to do, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do stuff like that," she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have hit back at the claims that they are racist, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do, fearing they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife had sent her something that she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Likening the suit to "extortion," Plasco said his wife was just two months off having a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're going to go after someone like that?
That's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social media, slamming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn't relate to a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put oneself in the shoes of somebody reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's very amusing knowing now what we know about Paddington's huge success."
Saying her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book by a small toy bear, would have been sanguine about his work being rejected, she added the 60th anniversary of the books publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't a boastful person," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like if you have a child who achieves something: you're proud of them even though it's not your doing really.
I think he viewed Paddington's success sort of in that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
On landing her daughter had been rushed to Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad was calling regularly to say it was really bad, that she wasn't expected to make it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say she was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly petering out and leaving her system.
She had died some time before hand and this was it all shutting down.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing this was all unfolding.
I couldn't howl or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to really hold it together."
Eventually Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, by now grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside the other passengers - oblivious to the ordeal she was going through.
"No-one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and tears were falling the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering with depression and killed himself aged 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel everyday," she said.
Ms Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up any room."
However, he gave up work before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one to find his sibling after he had taken his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I continually worry that there's going to be a knock on effect."
Ms Davis created the cards, "to let people know there are people out there that you can go to and you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you need to talk."
Ms Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say that he was feeling down or depressed or anything," she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change in attitude.
He was at rock bottom on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents he didn't make eye contact with them or anything."
She said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to work through it: "It rips a hole through the family.
It tears us apart.
But we've all got to carry on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI begins investigation
"I thought, if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - an investigation limited in time, limited in scope - we could maybe bring a little unity," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid entrenched partisan gridlock.
Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is all due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, lobbying them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It's still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea defector numbers 'drop' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations.
This came after June's historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever performed that way, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times nearly shouting and choking up while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think that he disqualifies himself with those statements and the manner in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi demurred when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrats gain the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then he's not fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered to be a conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions on whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to the court and expect us to say, 'isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And Women Need to Wield It.
It is a righteous diatribe, months and years of fury spilling over, and she can't get it out without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's uncommon, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive someplace, who said she also cried when she got angry, but developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she'd say to the person she was talking to, "You may think I am sad because I am crying.
I am angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought that was brilliant."
Tears are permitted as an outlet for wrath in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories from an early job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself weeping with inexpressible rage, was my being grabbed by the scruff of my neck by an older woman - a chilly manager of whom I'd always been slightly terrified - who dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and will be pleased because they got to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential runs.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and bowed out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, figured there was no reason she shouldn't explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision," she said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Somebody called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind on fund-raising, and so she vowed that she wouldn't enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give her only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions - gratitude for the people who'd supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger at the sexism - that she got choked up.
"You would have thought I'd had a nervous breakdown," recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You'd have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She cried"?""
How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time in kind, most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards right, US trade war pressures could positively support China over the long term by lowering the inter-dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic tailspin in either country is actually a lot more dangerous than onlookers have acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it's ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by a more than seven-year long war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe clinches Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they required to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most of the tournament, plunked his tee-shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole, conceding his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all of his rounds, becoming 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format begun in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the tournaments all-time winningest European with 25.5 career point.
"I don't usually cry but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
So thankful for Thomas to pick me and believe in me.
I am so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team., and I'm happy I was able to help," said an emotional Garcia following the European victory.
He passes the torch to his fellow countryman John Ram who took down US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles play on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel, to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all-time, having won 14 major titles second to only Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairways with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the entire tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was time this morning when we put some heat on Europe.
We scrapped.
Hats off to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as captain.
You have to tip your cap.
We got outplayed."

According to the UK media, Admiral William Moran, the deputy director of Naval Operations, said that even though the US Navy was reinvigorating to cope with the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States would continue to take the Asia-Pacific region as the focus of its navy -- the Pentagon had expanded the scope of Asia-Pacific region to include the Indian Ocean - Asia - the Pacific.
According to the reports from the site of "Jane's Defence Weekly" on September 24, China and Russia were classified as the strategic competitors in the new national defense strategy, which was announced by the United States at the beginning of the year.
Then, the US Navy recommissioned the Second Fleet to stand up against the Russian activities more directly.
It was reported that these actions raised some doubts and concerns among its allies and analysts. They were afraid that the US Navy might go far away from the strategy of "Rebalancing toward Asia-Pacific", which marked the Obama administration.
However, Admiral William Moran said that the focus of the US Navy would still focus on the West Pacific.
At the round-table discussion, which was hosted by National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington on January 24, 2018, he said: "For us, there are any significant changes. "
Moran said: "The focus remains on rebalancing, shifting focus or whatever you want to describe it. "
But he admitted that the United States kept close relations with Europe.
He said: "We would continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast. "
Although he pointed out that the overall policy about Russia fell within the terms of reference of the United States Secretary of Defense, he warned: "The Russians might face the demographic and economic challenges, but the history demonstrates that they will become very tough if we have a conflict with them. "
Admiral Moran said that as a part of the comeback action to fight against Russia, China and other competitors, the US Navy was dynamically deploying the troops into a "new campaign mode". This would help to make the opponents unaware unprepared for the deployments of the American aircraft carrier battle group or other assets at any specified time and place.
He said: "Our Navy and Marine Corps support it -- the concept of unpredictable battle. We should not show up at the same place again and again like clockwork. -- This is our approach. "
It was reported that the first to try this new approach was the "Harry Truman" aircraft carrier battle group, and its early deployment included the working visits to ports and the patrols in areas, where it usually only passed.
Moran said that the US Navy was currently trying to ensure its allies to know that these warships would still patrol in the traditional areas, and solving the logistical problems and family liaison problems for new deployment process.
Vice Admiral Michael Noonan, the Commander of Royal Australian Navy, also delivered a speech in this event to indicate that the Australian army could seamlessly cooperate with the American aircraft carrier battle group.
He said that this situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy had planned to purchase another 9 frigates with the "Aegis" combat system.

Itochu recognized $1.3 billion impairment losses to the investment on CITIC Limited on Friday. Write-downs of this largest enterprise investment was made due to influences of tense China-US trade.
In May 2016, a man passed by the headquarter of Marubeni Corporation in Tokyo, Japan.
Marubeni said that the trade war struck Gavilon, the subordinate American cereal department, which has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Previously, some Japanese manufacturers of heavy equipment and telecommunications companies have warned about the impact of China-US trade frictions when announcing their latest performance, and now these Japanese traders have joined the ranks.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on each other's goods with the price of hundreds of billions of dollars. President Trump threatened to expand the scope of the tariff to more than $500 billion of goods imported from China if the dispute could not be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, the Chief Financial Officer of Itochu, said that the trade dispute might have greater impact on Chinese economy next year.
Itochu and Charoen Pokphand Group invested $10 billion to CITIC in 2015, gaining 20% stock equity.
Hachimura said that Itochu proposed 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) losses to this part of share holdings since it considered the share price of CITIC not to rise again.
Itochu maintains its profit prediction of 500 billion yen of the financial year ended 31 March, 2019.
China imposed a 25% import tariff on the soybeans imported from America in July, to counter the initiatives of Washington on trade frictions.
"Our cereal business has been struck by China-US trade frictions," the Chief Financial Officer of Itochu Nobuhiro Yabe said.
He said that Gavilon has terminated the financial transaction of its account since September.
Pat Burke, the spokesman of Gavilon, pointed out in the statement on Friday that the action of this company was "in the light of internal policy limits and due to lack of market opportunities. "
He also said that the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to reduction of employment positions.
Itochu maintained its annual profit prediction of 230 billion yen, helped by pulp, papermaking and power generation.
Sumitomo published its profit increase by 16% from April to September on Thursday, emphasizing that "the trade problems between America and China lead to uncertainty. "

Mitsubishi Corporation also announced its new business plan, aiming to increase profits in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 from estimated 640 billion yen this year to 900 billion yen ($7.98 billion)
Report on November 5 of China News A round-up report: the U.S. midterm election starts counting down.
On November 4, President Trump and his democratic opponents actively "drum up votes" on their core voters.
Both Parties indicated that voter turnout will be a key factor to influence the situation of election.
According to the report, in 48 hours before the Americans went to vote, Trump was busy attending the rally for the Republican candidate, while the former President Obama just arrived in Indiana to rally for Joe Donnelly, the Democratic candidate of the Federal Senate, who asked for emergency help for the situation of election, and to shout out his final pre-election appeal.
On November 4, Trump went to Maycomb, Georgia to rally for Brian Kemp, the state governor of Republicans. He said, "you must go to the polls and cast a vote. "
"The contrast in this election cannot be clearer. "
Voters’ political enthusiasm has boosted to a rare peak and early voting of some states has been far more than usual.
When successive American presidents face their first midterm elections, their parties tend to have fewer members of congress.
According to the new poll released by the "Washington Post" and the ABC News on Day 4, although the Democratic situation of election for the House of Representatives maintains an advantage, the Republicans could benefit from an economic assessment and Trump's strict focus on border security.
The poll indicates that more registered voters like the Democratic candidate of the House of Representatives than the Republican candidate with proportion of 50% versus 43%. However, it still falls down compared with leading of 14 percentage points in August.
According to the other poll made by NBC and the Wall Street Journal, the Democrats still take 7 percentage points ahead of the Republicans.
It is reported that Obama told the crowds at a rally for Senator Donnelly, "When people don't tell the truth, and words don't mean anything anymore, that's going to have evil consequences.
Democracy does not work when people can only desperately tell lies. "
"Now, the only way to stop the behaviors of these Republicans is you and your vote. "
The Democrats face the toughest situation of election in the Senate for decades, and now the Republicans hold more than half (51) of seats.
However, the situation of election in the House of Representatives is relatively advantageous, and the Democrats need to win 23 seats to take control of 435 seats of the House of Representatives.
According to the assessment of analysts from FiveThirtyEight.com, a website for predicting the situation of election, the possibility that the Democrats win the House of Representatives can reach up to 85%.

People’s Daily Online, Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) - In the current tide of "mass entrepreneurship and innovation", more and more technology companies have begun to pay attention to patent R&D and related protection work, and deeply explore the potential value of patents to occupy the market domination.
Similarly, many technology companies have encountered numerous infringements crisis in patent technology licensing and patent technology use.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province, on the grounds of patent infringement, appealed the developer of "Didi Chuxing" APP, Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaoju Technology), the operator, Didi Chuxing Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Chuxing), the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately stopped the actions of manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, and using the plaintiff’s patent.
On October 30, 2018, China Judgment Online published the "First-instance Civil Ruling Paper of Infringement of Invention Patent Rights between Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.", which disclosed some details of case in which the Didi Chuxing APP was sued for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs believe that they are the patentees and inventors of the "carpooling service system and method based on mobile terminals", and the whole operation process of the "ride-sharing" application in the "Didi Chuxing" APP corresponds to the technical solution of the patent protection involved in the case, which formed a patent infringement.
However, during the court’s ruling, Xiaoju Technology believed that Guangdong Pacific was not an eligible defendant. It only provided free downloads of the involved APP "Didi Chuxing" on the Internet, and did not implement the patent method involved. There was no direct or indirect infringement behavior, and it should not be included as a defendant in this case.
Secondly, the infringement of this case was not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the infringement of the patent involved should be the place where the patent method involved in the case was completely implemented. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the court was challenged and the case was requested to be transferred to the court of the defendant's domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the alleged infringement Didi Chuxing APP product on its online platform. It is not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
And the defendant Guangdong Pacific’s domicile is located in Guangzhou, under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant Xiaoju Technology advocated that the case be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial with inadequate evidence. The Court dismissed the defendant Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.’s objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and ordered it assume the acceptance fee for the case.
At present, the other trials of the case have not been announced, and the reporter will pay close attention to the follow-up details of the patent infringement case of Didi Chuxing.
Exclusive Interview with CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization: Australia-China Science and Technology Cooperation Achieved Remarkable Results
"China’s science and technology have developed rapidly in the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve fruitful results by going forward hand in hand in the scientific field. "
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization said in an exclusive interview with a reporter from the China News Service in Beijing, the cooperation between Australia and China in the field of science and technology has shown great vitality from the cooperation in dealing with climate change to the "Eye of Heaven" project.
As the largest national research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many world famous innovative research results in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"This is a lasting friendship that involves the trust of partners and the tradition of long-term cooperation. ", Marshall said.
In May of this year, China’s Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope ― China’s Eye of Heaven, installed the world’s first 19-beam L-band receiver.
This internationally most advanced 19-beam feed source receiver is jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on CSIRO’s many years of technical accumulation. When enabled, the FAST survey speed will increase by 5 to 6 times, meanwhile more scientific observation targets will be expanded.
"This is the contribution of CSIRO to FAST. "
In addition to the above cooperations, CSIRO is also working closely with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of Square Kilometer Array radio telescope, research and development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific researches often focused on problems after hundreds of years, and now more scientific research power is needed to solve the problems in front of them. "
Marshall believed that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and both countries face a series of challenges in their development progress.
For example, extreme weather occurs frequently in the world. Drought and floods have led to a reduction in food production and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, population explosion, aging, chronic disease and other problems are also the serious challenges we faced.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused on solving these current problems. "
Marshall said that the key job of Center for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research, jointly established by CSIRO and National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), are observing El Nino phenomenon and La Nina phenomenon, studying the relationships between these two phenomenons and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather. The new species of cereals developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences can overcome extreme weather and can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, technological innovation is difficult to accomplish by oneself, it requires extremely high costs, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today. "
Marshall expressed that the closer the cooperation is, the more likely it is to make breakthroughs. This is also the significance of Australia and China in strengthening cooperation under the framework of the "One Belt One Road".
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly for cooperation in science and technology for us. "
Marshall took the example that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method without using cyanide. Because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a way to purify gold with little environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology to China. This is one of the achievements of our participation in the "One Belt One Road" cooperation. "

Ri Yong Ho, the foreign minister North Korea, told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening the distrust of the United States on North Korea and it was impossible for North Korea to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said on the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had taken "very kind actions" during the last year, including cessation of missile and nuclear tests, dismantling of nuclear test sites and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies
"However, we haven’t seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"If the United States doesn’t trust on us, we have no confidence in our national security. It is impossible for us to unilaterally abandon the nuclear weapons under such circumstances. "
Although Ri Yong Ho repeated the complaints of North Korea about the opposition of United States to "phased" denuclearization, his speech was of great significance because it did not completely refuse the unilateral denuclearization as North Korea had before.
Ri Yong Ho mentioned the joint statement between Jeong-eun Kim and Trump on June 12, and at that time Jeong-eun Kim agreed to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to protect the security of North Korea.
North Korea has always been seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that North Korea must firstly abandon nuclear weapons.
The United States also refused to loose the requirements for the international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goals in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue the ‘declaration of the end of the war’," Ri Yong Ho said.
"The thought that sanctions can make us kneel and beg forgiveness is the daydream of the people who don't know us.
However, the problem is that such continued sanctions are deepening our distrust. "
Ri Yong Ho did not mention the second Trump-Kim summit plan mentioned by the US President earlier this week at the United Nations.
On the contrary, he emphasized the three meetings between Jeong-eun Kim and Moon Jae-in, the South Korean President over the past five months and said, "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea, but not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked. "
China announced that it will reduce import tariffs on 1,585 tax items from November 1, 2018.
Since this year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1 this year, the drug was fully tax-deducted, and all import tariffs for all 28 tax items of general taxable drugs, including anticancer drugs, and alkaloid drugs with anticancer effects, and Chinese patent medicines with actual imports, were adjusted to zero.
At the same time, it has also greatly reduced the production and import links value-added tax burden of anti-cancer drugs.
On July 1, tax reductions were imposed on 218 tax items of cars and parts.
After the tax reduction, the finished automobile tax rate of China’s automobile has been lower than the average level of developing countries, which is in line with the actual situation of China’s automobile industry.
This tax reduction will drive the restructuring of the industry and the optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the survival of the fittest to help improve the quality of products and services. It is expected to promote the adjustment of automobile prices to a certain extent, so that consumers can get more benefits.
On July 1, tax reductions were imposed on 1449 tax items of daily consumer goods.
The tax reduction on daily consumer goods is closely bound up with people’s need of better lives.
This time’s tax reduction not only involves lots of items but also has strong dynamics, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
The reduction of taxes on daily consumer goods directly benefits the consumers and promotes the competitiveness of domestic industries.
November 1, tax reductions will be imposed on 1585 industrial product tax items of electromechanical devices, parts and raw materials.
Appropriately reducing the import tariffs of some domestically industrial products with urgent needs can attract more foreign capital, help increase domestic effective supply, assist industrial upgrading, and contribute to enterprises allocate resources on a global scale, reduce production costs, and also benefit for reducing the pressure on the domestic environment.
Relevant person in charge of Customs Tariff Commissions Office of the State Council introduced that the above four times initiative tax reduction and the third step tax reduction implemented on this year’s July 1 in accordance with the results of the expansion of the information technology agreement negotiation will result in the overall tariff level fell from last year’s 9.8% to 7.5%.
The adjusted overall tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than most developing countries, at a moderately low level, and basically matches China’s developing country status and development stage.
According to the person in charge, as one of the important indicators of the degree of openness in China’s trade in goods sector, the overall level of tariffs should be compatible with the stage of China’s economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China’s trade in goods scale ranks first in the world, and it has already had the economic foundation to further expand its openness. However, there is still a gap between the quality and efficiency of trade development compared with developed economies. Therefore, the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately lowered.
Tariff is a kind of protect means for compliance. The level of tariff should be compatible with industrial competitiveness to encourage healthy competition. While overprotection goes against the industry development and quality improvement.
Tariff rate adjustment must balance production needs with consumer demands.
Focus on reducing the commodity tax rate that has a large domestic demand and contributes to the transformation and upgrading of the industry, and striving to increase the import of characteristic advantage products with relatively concentrated needs of the people, continuously improving the sense of gain of enterprises and the public, and meeting the upgrading needs of the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The tax reduction should balance the financial revenue and the affordability of industrial development.
In the choice of specific tax-reduction commodities and range of tax reductions, we must plan and coordinate the domestic and international markets, the upstream and downstream aspects, production and consumption relationship, and maintain the steady development of China’s economy.
The principal stressed that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. China’s initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure based on China’s own needs to achieve high-quality development. It is conducive to the overall planning and utilization of international and foreign resources to promote the quality of domestic supply systems and meet the upgrading consumption needs of people.
This action and measure shows tfhat China will constantly pursue an opening up strategy of mutual benefit and win-win result, firmly support economic globalization, steadfastly uphold the principle of free trade rule and the multilateral trading system centered on the WTO, and continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world to also allow China’s development to better benefit the world.
Serbia announced to enter the top defense readiness condition. Serbian President and Russian President will meet to discuss the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.
Yugoslav news agency reported by quoting sources from the Office of Serbian President that Vucic, the Serbian President, gave orders that the Serbian armed forces entered the top defense readiness condition in consideration of the fact that Kosovo special troops had occupied the roadway to the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station under the control of Belgrade in northern Kosovo.
On September 29, Vulin, the Defense Minister of Serbia, announced that the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness condition.
Vulin emphasized that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as Vucic's orders were still effective. Regardless of the direction in which the situation develops, the Serbian army will respond accordingly.
It was reported by the Tass news agency of Russia that Vucic said in an interview on September 29 that he had notified the United States, Russia, Europe and other sides about the current situation, and would visit Moscow on October 2 to meet with Putin, the President of Russia, to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When he was asked whether Serbia needed to get the military support from Russia like Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: "I don't want a significant military conflict in our territory. "
Vucic also said that the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness condition just for the sake of deterrence to prevent the conflict. However, it was a clear warning: Serbia would never tolerate any violent action in Kosovo.
The Serbian army upgraded the defense readiness condition in connection with the two actions in Kosovo.
According to the statement of Serbia, the Albanian people were carrying out the mass arrests of Serbian people, who had been living there for generations, in recent days, but these arrested Serbian people didn't break any laws.
Vucic said that since Marko Juric, the head of the Serbian government's Office for Kosovo and Metohija, was beaten and detained by the Albanian army in Kosovo, the Albanian people constantly escalated the issues in the region and carried out the inhumane arrests and deportations of the Serbian people.
Furthermore, over 100 people, including the members of ROSU special army of the Department of the Interior of the self-declared Republic of Kosovo, armed police, and snipers, occupied the battle field near the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station, entered the ecological sport center near the dam in northern Kosovo, and blocked all roads nearby. These areas were originally under the control of Serbia.
Vucic indicated that Kosovo was encouraged by the western countries to make this military adventure. Since the Kosovo army had taken actions without notifying Serbia in advance, it violated the rules in Paragraph 1 in Chapter 9 of "Brussels Agreement", and it also breached the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military technology agreement between Serbia and Kosovo.
Vucic had spoken to Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary-General, to criticize the western countries for their false words on the Kosovo issue.
The source of current conflict was still the historical grievances lasting for hundreds of years between Serbian people and Albanian people in Kosovo.
For the ownership of Kosovo, Serbian people and Albanian people had different opinions.
Serbia considered Kosovo as the birthplace of its nation and the cradle of culture, because Serbia had built its most powerful country here in the 12th century. However, the Albanian people settled here in large numbers only after the Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbian army retreated to the north.
The Albanian people insisted that the Illyrian people of the primitive tribe located at Kosovo in the 4th-5th century were their ancestors. Therefore, Kosovo had been the Albanian people's territory since ancient times.
The subjective political divisions contributed to the sharp conflicts between different nations, religions and cultures, resulting in the fierce confrontation between Serbian people and Albanian people in Kosovo.
The Albanian people in Kosovo first declared the independence of Albania in 1912.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanian people, who were living in the Balkan Peninsula, moved to Turkey. The proportion of Serbian people was relatively rising. The actions of "taking back their own lands" in the sight of the Serbian people were considered as the predations of the "Greater Serbian Nationalism" by Albanian people. The contradiction between the two nations intensified.
Kosovo became the "powder keg" of Balkan.
The Albanian separatists in Kosovo liberation army and the Serbian army and police engaged in armed conflicts in 1999, which led to the NATO troops bombed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia consisting of Serbia and Montenegro. The Kosovo War broke out.
Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008.
Thereafter, the news came out that Serbia and Kosovo would normalize relations, and sign a global and legally binding agreement. However, due to the historical grievances between the two nations and the geopolitical constraints, they failed to sign the agreement, which was in the control of different forces, including the United States, Europe and Russia.
Just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he insisted to separate Serbian people from Albanian people in Kosovo. It exposed the conflict between the two nations again.
Power Communication Still in interruption. Difficulties in Rescue due to Strong Earthquakes with Tsunami in Indonesia.
According to figures released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency on the morning of the 30th, a devastating earthquake and the caused tsunami in the Donggala Regency in Central Sulawesi caused 420 people on 28th.
Wilem Rampangilei, head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said that the figure is only preliminary statistics from the Palu in Central Sulawesi, about 80 kilometers from the epicenter. Because of the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery, many damaged and collapsed hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and other densely populated buildings due to the earthquake have not been searched and rescued.
On September 29, 2018, in Palu, Indonesia, a bridge damaged by the earthquake and tsunami collapsed into several sections.
Due to the severe damage to power and communication facilities, the epicenter of Donggala Regency and the neighboring Sigi area are still “lonely islands" that cannot be reached, and the number of victims cannot be counted.
According to media reports here, Indonesian Vice President Kalla said the death toll may reach thousands.
Power interruption, communication interruption, road blockage, airport damage... The rescue work after strong earthquakes and tsunami is very difficult.
Due to power interruption, some hospitals and rescue settlements in Palu rely on fuel for power generation.
The roads entering and leaving the city are blocked due to landslides, and large transport vehicles, including tank trucks, are unable to enter, which makes the fuel supply very tight.
Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs, Agus said that due to road damage, the Ministry dispatched emergency relief materials such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food and household goods packages from Central Sulawesi and Gorontalo adjacent to the earthquake region have not arrived in the disaster area.
The disaster relief materials transported from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area through the air transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to thecontrol tower and runways of the Palu Airport during the earthquake, all commercial flights have been grounded to ensure the safety and security of the rescue. The airport is only used for the take-off and landing of military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel.
Wiranto, the Indonesian Coordinating Ministry for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who directed the rescue in the earthquake zone, demanded that the power supply and airport commercial flights be restored as soon as possible to ensure the operating of hospitals and other relief agencies, so that more rescuers, volunteers and aids can be transported to disaster areas.
On the 28th, several strong earthquakes occurred in Donggala Regency in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia continuously. The 7.7-magnitude earthquake that occurred at 17:02 local time caused a tsunami, which caused Palu City, Donggala Regency and Sigi area occurred major disasters.
China News Service, Beijing, October 1 (reported by Yin Li) -- A cloudless blue sky in the day and the red clouds at evening......Recently, Beijing kept in the mode of the most beautiful blue sky. Thousands of Beijing residents couldn't help to change tactics to show their pictures on social platforms and constantly make status updates to show their happinesses. They said that "the most beautiful skyline with a blue sky and white clouds was the best business card of Beijing".
Beijing had met the "bluest sky" since August.
It could be found anywhere in Beijing at any time that many residents were holding their smart phones or DSLR cameras to take pictures.
On social platforms, such as the microblog and WeChat Moments, people could see the different beauty of the Imperial Palace, Tian An Men, the Bird's Nest, Hutong, and various buildings against the blue sky in the net friends' cameras.
Some net friends said that such "landscape pictures" were the best city images of Beijing; and some net friends joked that if the blue sky remain the same for a long time, the patients with cervical spondylosis would surely be cured; some net friends even hoped that "the blue sky would last through the winter, spring and summer, providing Beijing with a blue sky across four seasons".
Why did the residents in Beijing particularly like to show the blue sky?
That's because they had been suffering from the fog and haze in this city in the past. They looked forward to the blue sky eagerly. After starting the "Blue Sky Protection Campaign" in Beijing to continuously improve the air quality, there were less fog and haze, but more blue skies. The residents were joyful to see this. And they felt so happy with it.
The weather was fine in Beijing on National Day.
Most of 35 air quality monitoring stations in Beijing showed in green at 8:00 am, indicating the "Superior First Grade".
The photography competition with the theme of the "bluest sky" voluntarily organized by the residents on social platforms was still under way.
Why was the sky so blue in Beijing recently?
As the relevant responsible person of Beijing Environmental Protection Agency explained, the mean concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was 35 micrograms per cubic meter in Beijing in August of this year, which created the best record for the same period in history of the recent five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 was even less than 10 in September.
The major factor contributing to the "bluest sky" was the overall favorable meteorological conditions in recent days. And more importantly, Beijing had persistently carried out the air pollution control. It had vigorously promoted the Clean Air Action Plan in the past five years, and the environmental benefits were released continuously resulting in the reduction of total pollutant emission in the region. These laid the foundation for continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing released officially and implemented the "2013-2017 Clean Air Action Plan in Beijing" in 2013.
According to this plan, the authority would continue to guide the alleviation of functions unrelated to its status as national capital, and promoted the works of clean energy substitutions and pollutants discharge reductions. 4923 coal fired boilers were eliminated in total.
Thus, Beijing became the first big city of achieving the full network of natural gasification in the Chinese mainland.
According to the data, the annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing from 2013 to 2017 cumulatively dropped by 35.6%; the number of days that the air quality reached the standards increased by 50; the number of days that achieved the Superior First Grade increased by 25; the number of days with heavy pollution reduced by 35 in total, and the occurrence rate of heavy pollution significantly dropped.
With the continuous improvement of air quality, Beijing authority issued the "Three-year Action Plan of Beijing to Win the Blue Sky Protection Campaign" in September on the basis of the analysis of a new round of PM2.5 source. According to the current governance phase and pollution characteristics, it focused on the important prevention and control areas including the treatment of diesel trucks, flying dusts, and volatile organic compounds, optimized and adjusted the transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land-use structure, strengthened the inter-regional prevention and control, enhanced the delicacy management of city, promoted the green development in an all-round way, and strived to keep the "bluest sky" permanently in Beijing. The sky would not "be precious", since it was rare. Let it return to be the background of people's photo album, but not the leading role.
During this year’s National Day Golden Week, the Municipal Tourism Commission, Industry and Commerce Bureau, City Urban Administrative and Law Enforcement Bureau, Public Security Bureau and other relevant departments will strengthen the law enforcement inspection of the "one-day tour" market, focusing on the "six unlicensed" chaos in tourism, and once verified, the violations will be imposed on strict and serious punishment according to the law.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a thematic meeting on illegal "one-day tour" to deploy a special action to further crack down on illegal "one-day tour".
At the meeting, the focus was on the "six unlicensed" chaos that was intertwined with the unlicensed ticket provider, unlicensed tour guide, unlicensed travel agency, unlicensed car, tourist trap and unlicensed website profit chain. The city launched a special action for "one-day tour" on July 28th.
Since the launch of the special action, the city has accepted 39 "one-day tour" complaints with a year on year decrease of 63%. Since the beginning of this year, the city has accepted 270 "one-day tour" complaints with a year on year decrease of 62%.
In the past two months, the city has checked and detained 248 "unlicensed cars", investigated and handled 158 violations of the tourist transportation business, shut down 29 shopping "tourist traps" and performing arts venues, investigated and handled 13 "unlicensed travel agencies" and 27 "unlicensed tour guides", confiscated 26,000 pieces of illegal advertisements, torn down 31 pieces of illegal "one-day tour" billboards and 3 pieces of fake bus stop signs, investigated and handled 1789 various types of travel-related violations, and 181 cases were filed by various functional departments with a heavier fine of 4.48 million yuan and 111 travel-related illegal criminals were detained.
After rectification, the illegal "one-day tour" chaos has been basically contained, and the "one-day tour" market order has shown a steady and good trend.
According to the information, the city has continuously strengthen the force of illegal "one-day tour rectification in recent years.
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission accepted 1,612 complaints and 897 complaints of "one-day tour", a year-on-year decrease of 79% and 44% respectively. Though the crack down actions are contentiously implemented, the illegal "one-day tours" are still recurrent, forming the intertwined profit chains among the "six unlicensed" chaos of unlicensed ticket provider, unlicensed tour guide, unlicensed travel agency, unlicensed car, tourist trap and unlicensed website.
Specifically, "unlicensed ticket provider" is the person who attract customers on the street illegally, "unlicensed website" is the illegal website providing fake tourism information, "unlicensed travel agency" engaged in illegal "one-day tour" or an institution without business qualification of travel agencies, "unlicensed tour guide" is the tour guide without tourist certificate or practice illegally and employed by the "unlicensed travel agency", "unlicensed car" is the vehicle without tourist transportation qualification used by "unlicensed tour guide" or the vehicle with tourist transportation qualification used for providing passenger service to illegal "one-day tour", and last, the "unlicensed tour guide" will bring the tourists to the specified travel shopping store, that is "tourist trap".
In this special action, the city continued to increase the fixed inspection and flexible inspection of illegal "one-day tour". Focus on the illegal "one-day tour" with high frequency and influential tourist route points, the relevant departments assigned daily secret investigation teams to make investigations with the tour groups secretly, and strict investigation and treatment will be imposed according to the law, if violations are found.
Among them, "unlicensed car" and "tourist trap" have become the two focuses of the serious crack downs in the special action.
According to reports, without "unlicensed cars", the illegal "one-day tour" can not be completed, "unlicensed cars" are easy to be found, remembered and investigated, they are also fixed value with a hinger single value.
Relevant departments used road traffic surveillance cameras to increase the supervision of the tourist buses along the key "one-day tour" routes, and use intelligence measures such as technology prevention and physical prevention to find and investigate "unlicensed cars" in time.
"Tourist trap" during traveling has become a key focus due to its small number and operation in locality.
In order to strengthen the shock and attack on illegal "one-day tour", all the functional departments will impose heavy and strict punishments according to law, once they have verified the violation of laws and regulations.
In August of this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to illegal "one-day tour", and discussed means and methods combining administrative punishment with conviction of imprisonment.
The Municipal Tourism Commission said that in the future, more formal travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out Beijing "one-day tour" and increase the supply of formal "one-day tour" to further occupy the living space of illegal "one-day tour". The specific plan is still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has continuously improved the electronic travel itinerary information system of the tour group to ensure that each group is included in the electronic itinerary platform supervision.
From a tourist symbol to a symbol of digital economy, what has Wuzhen experienced in these years
As the permanent site of the World Internet Conference, the way that Wuzhen undertakes the dividend of the summit attracts much attention.
Since the first World Internet Conference, Wuzhen has obvious changes over the past five years.
In 2014, there were only 12 enterprises related to the digital economy and Internet all over the town. By the third quarter of this year, there have been more than 500 enterprises.
This is a miniature of the development of digital economy in Wuzhen.
The Internet Conference enables local enterprises to accept the enlightenment of the digital economy and the wave of digitization from zero distance. Enterprises have a strong desire to make transformation and upgrade. Traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased investment and research and development in the aspects of machine substitution, intelligent management, etc.
Jiang Wei, the Party secretary of Wuzhen, says that the town will build a new economic empowered center in the future.
The development of digital economy cannot be separated from the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen has launched a 5G pilot project based on full coverage of 4G communication networks and free WiFi.
Meanwhile, Tongxiang city, where Wuzhen is located, as the first county-level city in China to build a special channel for international Internet data, has become a hot spot for the development of Internet industry.

After aggressive treatment, the survival rate of premature infants of 29 weeks and more gestation is 98% in China, which has reached the level of developed countries.
ECNS, Shanghai, September 30 (reported by Chen Jing and Luo Yanqian) -- Children's National Medical Center and Children's Hospital of Fudan University disclosed on September 30 that it had introduced the Canadian advanced method in the leading "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China".
The project result showed that after aggressive treatment, the survival rate of premature infants of 29 weeks and more gestation was 98% in China, which had reached the level of developed countries. However, the survival rate of premature infants of minimum gestation and the survival rate of premature infants without complications still needed to be improved greatly.
During the past 20 years, the Chinese government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborns.
Currently, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71‰, which is significantly lower than the national average level and has reached the advanced level of developed countries.
The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China" has significantly improved the survival quality of premature infants through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, the director of NICU of Children's Hospital of Fudan University told the reporter that it was of great significance for the improvement of premature infants' overall survival quality and population quality to pay attention to the reduction of premature infants' survival quality, reduce the complication rates, improve the neurodevelopmental prognosis, and improve the overall outcome of baby patients while improving the survival rate of premature infants. It was an important problem of concern to the pediatric and neonatal departments at home and abroad, and it was also a critical issue in this project.
The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China" has included tens of thousands of cases of premature infants of 33 weeks and less gestation in China and has contributed to 1/3 reduction of the mortality rate of premature infants of minimum gestation and small birth weight through four years of unremitting efforts. At the same time, the severe complication rate of premature infants has been significantly reduced and the survival quality of premature infants has been greatly improved.
This project has established a set of complete, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement methods, which are suitable for our domestic conditions and will collaboratively improve the prognosis of premature infants and improve the level of neonatal care by setting up the national collaboration network of national quality improvement, introducing the concepts of collaborative quality improvement, and combing 25 cooperative hospitals in China.
Children's Hospital of Fudan University is connecting the forces of neonatal departments across the country, and developing the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated in the project in order to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections.
It is reported that in the "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China", the pediatric hospitals has introduced the EPIQ methods into 25 large NICU in 19 provinces in order to solve the disturbing problem of neonatal infections in China NICU.
After more than 10 years of constant improvement, the survival rate of premature infants without complications in Canada has increased by about 1/3. Canada is now one of the countries with the best prognosis in premature infants in the world.
The EPIQ methods have been widely applied to all NICUs in Canada, and have been adopted by 6 other countries.
According to the pediatric hospital, the research results show that after implementing the EPIQ intervention for two years, the infection rate of premature infants will drop by 35%, and the usage rate of antibiotics will drop by 20%.
In the future, Children's Hospital of Fudan University will continue to promote and implement these methods in the whole country, aiming at comprehensively reducing the occurrence rates of all complications in premature infants and improving the quality of treatment for newborns in China.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differences and inequalities in the level of treatment in various regions in China.
According to Professor Cao Yun's introduction, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role as an important construction unit of Children's National Medical Center. This project covers Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and many other western provinces, with the goal of gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal treatment throughout the country.
It is reported that Children's Hospital of Fudan University is connecting the forces of neonatal departments across the country, and developing the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated in the project in order to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections.
It has been revealed that the coordination center's Chinese Neonatal Network located at Children's Hospital of Fudan University will unite 63 hospitals across China to carry out the next stage of national quality improvement in 2019, with the goal of promoting the homogenization of neonatal treatment in China.
Wu Jinglei, the director of Shanghai Health and Family Planning Commission, says that Shanghai can become a central city in Asia center. Its research, construction of the entire service system, service quality and service outcomes should have a place in Asia, in order to truly reflect China's medical level.
Xin Shiping: Build the "monument of heroes" in the heart - written on the fifth Memorial Day.
On September 30, on the eve of the 69th birthday of the People's Republic of China, we ushered in the fifth Memorial Day. Xi Jinping and other Party and state leaders came to the Tian'anmen Square to attend the ceremony for presenting flower baskets to the people's heroes.
At this moment, please pay tribute to the heroes wherever you are.
The Memorial Day is not only for reviving, but also for awakening.
Look back the rich history, every martyr’s name represents a fresh life.
They also have fiery youth, sincere love and caring families.
However, for the belief that "the doctrine we believe in is the truth of the universe", and for the purpose to "spare the suffering of the next generation", they are willing to sacrifice everything.
"I would cry for China in each day of my life".
Through time and space, the heroes set up spiritual signposts to guide the way forward.
"Where do you come from and where do you go?"; "What kind of man you want to be?"; It's not hard to have the answers if you understand the heroes.
In memory of heroes, the most important thing is to build a "monument of heroes" in the heart.
According to the incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary wartime, around 20 million martyrs have died heroically for national independence, liberation of the people and prosperity of the country.
Due to various reasons, many martyrs don’t even leave their names.
Countless heroes and martyrs enrich ideals with blood, practice faith with life. To remember their names and inherit their spirit, is to protect the nation's root and soul.
This "monument of heroes" cannot be stained or damaged.
For some time, the historical nihilism, abused entertainment and other undercurrents emerge.
All sorts of actions that distort and disparage heroes and martyrs, challenge just conscience, derange value judgments, and cause the public indignation and vigilance of the whole society.
Heroes and martyrs cannot be desecrated, and heroes cannot be forgotten.
We cannot let actions that touch the bottom line drift. We must dare to show our sword and uphold the dignity of heroes with rule of law and justice.
On May 1, the law for the protection of heroes and martyrs came into force.
From the perspective of judicial practice, the verdict of some cases is to the satisfaction of the masses, which not only effectively maintains the glorious image of heroes in accordance with the law, but also releases the positive energy for respecting heroes and martyrs.
A nation with pursuits cannot live without heroes, and a country with ideals cannot live without pioneers.
It has become a common social consensus to recall the martyrs and call for heroes.
Currently, there are millions of memorial facilities of various kinds in China, and more than 100 million people visit the martyrs' cemetery every year.
The hearts of the people are the strongest footstones.
Let advocating heroes, defending heroes, learning from heroes and caring heroes prevail, and let the spirit of heroes merge into the national blood. The "monument of heroes" will stand firmly between sky and earth and deep in the hearts of the people.
Report of Reuters on September 28 in Brussels: The European Union took a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday after Italy looked down upon EU demands and surprised the market with a massive budget deficit plan. But if Italy stuck to a too bold goal, the EU might take a more radical stance.
The aim of Italian Eurosceptic government was that the budget deficit was equivalent to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the next three years, suggesting that there was no debt reduction despite deficit reduction requirements.
Moscovici, the executive committee member of economic affairs of the European Commission, said on Friday, "We are not interested in the crisis between the European Commission and Italy," he responded cautiously since the proposals and sanctions of the European Commission might have little impact on Italy.
The officials and diplomats of the European Commission still hoped that market forces would persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy officially submitted it to the European Commission in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while the Italian bond yields hit their highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit goal remained unchanged before the deadline in October, the European Commission might veto the Italian draft budget, which has never been done to any country by the European Commission.
Dombrowski, the Vice-President of the European Commission said at a meeting in Riga, the capital of Latvia later on Friday that current Italian fiscal plan "seems to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Convention", which was referred to the EU fiscal provisions.
However, he did not mention how this would trigger a response of the EU.
Bidders may submit their applications for participation in this open tender before October 26 this year.

At the crucial moment, the Turkish team made a mistake. After the Chinese team led by 21:19, they won the match point with 24:21 by Zhu Ting’s powerful smash and Zhang Changning’s attack. Then the Turkish team chased the score to 23:24, After the Chinese team requested a time out, Zhang Changning scored by attack and the Chinese team locked the victory at 25:23.
Chinese women’s volleyball coach Lang Ping said after the game that the whole game was not easy.
"We are well prepared, the aspect of block is good, the Turkish team is more comprehensive, we must reduce mistakes and strive to win by ourselves. "
Faced with the familiar teammates in the past, Zhu Ting, who played for the VakıfBank Sports Club, received a lot of restrictions in the first game of the day. Then she took the initiative to make changes and still played a strong offense.
"My opponents and I are very familiar with each other. It is normal to be marked by the opponent, but the Chinese team is playing to the extreme, and the block and the offense are playing well in the case of a bad first pass. "
Next, the Chinese women’s volleyball team will take a day off for physical and technical training; on October 2nd, they will face the third team in the group match, Canada.

[Abstract] As of September 28, various regions have introduced and implemented, or issued a document to publish to the public for measures of free or reduced-price opening for 981 scenic spots (74 spots for free and 907 spots for price reduction). The prices have been reduced in the scenic spots in Yunnan Stone Forest, the Dali Three Pagodas, the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, the Lijiang River in Guilin, Guangxi, Fujian Wuyi Mountain, Zhangjiajie in Hunan, Terracotta Army in Shaanxi, Mount Sanqingshan in Jiangxi and Kanas in Xinjiang.
In order to implement the deployment of the decision of the Central Economic Working Conference and the Government Work Report, the National Development and Reform Commission issued the Guiding Opinions on Improving the Formation Mechanism of Ticket Prices in State-owned Scenic Spots and Reducing Ticket Prices in Key State-owned Scenic Spots (hereinafter referred to as the Guiding Opinions) on June 28, requiring to improve the formation mechanism of ticket prices in state-owned scenic spots in terms of reasonable definition of the composition of ticket pricing costs, innovative price management methods and strict implementation pricing procedures, to ensure to achieve remarkable results for reducing the relatively high ticket prices in key state-owned scenic spots by the end of September.
Various regions have actively carried out work according to the deployment requirements and reduced a batch of key state-owned scenic spot ticket prices.
As of September 28, various regions have introduced and implemented, or issued a document to publish to the public for measures of free or reduced-price opening for 981 scenic spots (74 spots for free and 907 spots for price reduction). Among them, there are 159 5A scenic spots and 534 4A scenic spots, with a total of 693 and accounting for 70.6%.
Among 907 scenic spots which have reduced prices, the number of the attractions with the decreasing amplitude of more than 20% is 491, accounting for 54.3% and the number of the attractions with the decreasing amplitude of more than 30% is 214, accounting for 23.6%.
Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi, Shaanxi and other provinces have a relatively large number of price reduction scenic spots, of which the number of price reduction scenic spots in Yunnan is more than 100, with an overall decreasing amplitude of more than 30%.
The governments of Anhui, Chongqing and other six provinces (districts or cities) have all reduced prices for 5A scenic spots.
The prices have been reduced in the scenic spots with high social attention in Yunnan Stone Forest, the Dali Three Pagodas, the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, the Lijiang River in Guilin, Guangxi, Fujian Wuyi Mountain, Zhangjiajie in Hunan, Terracotta Army in Shaanxi, Mount Sanqingshan in Jiangxi and Kanas in Xinjiang.
The ticket prices of key state-owned scenic spots are gradual returning to the reasonable range, which is conducive to promoting the tourism industry to accelerate the transformation and upgrading from ticket economy to industrial economy, from minority tourism to mass tourism and from scenic spot tourism to all-for-one tourism, as well as conducive to forming a virtuous circle of optimization of the supply structure of tourism industry and steady expansion of the demand for tourism consumption, and promoting the sustainable and healthy development of scenic spots and tourism industry.
The National Development and Reform Commission also emphasizes that various regions should strengthen the regulation of price order in scenic spots, guide scenic spots to improve their services, and ensure to reduce prices without reducing quality.
Moreover, for the problems that the decreasing amplitude of ticket prices in some scenic spots is too small and so-called reduction but no practical reduction recently reported by the media, the National Development and Reform Commission has made a special inspection to require various regions to seriously solve the problems, timely respond to the social concerns, and effectively implement price reductions.

National wide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities experts walk into test fields, listen to the situation presentation from CAE Yu Shuxun academician team representative.
China News Service, Xinjiang, Xayar, September 30 (Geng Dandan, Wang Xiaojun) - Located in the Xayar County of Xinjiang, the cotton planted in film-free cotton planting test base has a breathtaking growth. Compared with the film cotton next to it, it is not inferior in any respect. A cluster of snow-white cotton competes "blooming" and is full of branches.
From September 27 to 28, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Xayar County, Xinjiang.
The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the film-free cotton technology system with "Chinese Cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body has initially achieved the goal of film-free planting in cotton fields, reducing the pollution of the Xinjiang cotton field film residue to the ecological environment and raw cotton. And film-free cotton integrated technology’s research and demonstration have achieved significant progresses.
Academician Yu Shuxun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, famous cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the national modern agricultural industrial technology system’s cotton system, introduced the growth of film-free cotton for Zhou Guomo, secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang A&F University.
"The comprehensive technology of the film-free cotton developed by us can completely realize the cotton planting without the film, and can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and realize green cotton planting. "
Yu Shuxun described, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang is China’s most important cotton-producing region. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the cotton planting area in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the national cotton area.
Since the introduction of mulching film in China in 1982, the filmed area of various types of crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of mulching film is about 30 million tons.
Among them, cotton mulching film coverage rate reached 100%, and cotton field mulching film accounted for about 60% of Xinjiang film use.
Use film-free cotton for production measurement, and the cotton output can be fully realized from 320 kg to 350 kg per mu.
With the increasing amount of mulching film input in Xinjiang, the residual film recovery rate is low, the residual film volume in the soil is gradually increased, and the soil structure damages and other problems caused by residual film seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great influence on the quality of cotton fiber.
Currently, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang mechanized harvesting area is about 14 million mu.
In the process of cotton mechanized harvesting, a large amount of broken film on earth surface and the cotton plant are picked up. The broken film doped in the raw cotton is difficult to remove during the processing of raw cotton, and can not be completely removed in the subsequent textile processing process, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On September 28, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Xayar County, Xinjiang.
In order to solve the cotton mulching film pollution, simplify the cotton planting technology and improve the cotton field efficiency, Yu Shuxun led his team to use 8 years to implement the "Chinese Cotton 619" film-free cotton technology planting, adding "advantages" to Xinjiang’s agricultural green development.
Yu Shuxun introduced, with the new idea of innovative breeding, they cultivate a new line of extra early ripening, saline-alkaline tolerance, low temperature resistant, and high yield upland cotton "Chinese Cotton 619".
" ‘Chinese Cotton 619’ has achieved a series of supporting measures such as film-free seeding machinery, improved seeding depth, shallow buried in drip irrigation zone, suitable seeding density screening, and reasonable chemical regulation under the condition of film-free cultivation in southern Xinjiang. "
At present, Aksu, Korla, Alear and other places have established a demonstration base for film-free cotton, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Film-free cotton planting has achieved high yield, cost savings, environmental protection and improved overall benefits.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Third Division of the Agricultural Science Research Institute of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration of film-free cotton cultivation techniques, the production of film-free cottonseed cotton can fully achieve 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, and may even be higher.
"The promotion of film-free cotton cultivation technology has great prospects. "
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, the film-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap between the current economic benefits and the cultivation of mulching film.
"The support of cotton purchasing price will be conducive to future promotion. "
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale promotion and application of the film-free cotton, making the industry of film-free cotton larger and stronger, and completely solving the problem of soil pollution caused by the film.

This policy was implemented from January 1, 2018.
It was clarified that the direct investments made by the foreign investors from their allocated profits included the equity investments made by the foreign investors from their allocated profits, such as capital increase, new construction, and share acquisition, but excluded the new shares, turning point increase shares, and acquisition of shares from the listed companies except the eligible strategic investments.
The foreign investors, who were qualified to enjoy the policy privilege of not imposing the withholding income tax according to the rules but failed to enjoy it actually, could apply for enjoying this policy privilege as a supplementary within three years from the date of actually paying the relevant tax and have the paid tax refunded.
More than that, after enjoying the policy privilege of not imposing the withholding income tax according to the rules, the foreign investors could continue to enjoy the policy privilege of not imposing the withholding income tax providing that the invested enterprise undergoing the reorganization met the criteria of special reorganization, and the tax treatment was actually implemented on the basis of special reorganization.

Except the responsibility of the enterprise that allocated the profits, the foreign investor would be held responsible for the delay of tax payment. The period of delayed tax payment would be calculated from the date of paying the relevant profits.

Wang Yi, the Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister made a speech at the Council of Foreign Relations on Friday, and said that currently, the China-U.S. relation came to a crossroad again. If both sides can actively treat each other with tolerance, expand and deepen the positive cooperation, and properly control differences and contradictions, they can open up a better prospect.
"The China-U.S. relation is our common asset which needs us to care about together. "
He said that it was expected that people of insight from all sectors of both countries took practical actions to maintain the healthy and stable development of the China-U.S. relation and jointly drove the China-U.S. relation to move forward in the right direction.
Wang Yi also emphasized again that China was certain to take a development road different from that of the traditional great powers.
This road with Chinese characteristics determined that China would not or can not repeat the mistake of a strong country becoming a hegemon, and determined that China would not become another United States, or challenge the United States, or even replace the United States.
Wang Yi made a speech with the topic of "Opportunity or challenge, partner or opponent" and said that currently, the profound crux of the problem is that some American friends believed that China would also make a mistake of a strong country becoming a hegemon, and even challenge and replace the leadership of the United States in the world.
"This is obviously a major strategic misjudgment. "
He said that this self-imagined suspicion was spreading, and had amplified the existing contradictions, giving rise to new doubts, and making it more difficult for China and the United States to solve specific problems and encounter more resistance.
Wang Yi pointed out that the road China was walking on was a road for peaceful development.
Chinese people have never had a gene for expansion.
It was believed that all countries can live in harmony, and make exchanges and mutual learning.
Regardless of past, present or future, China would never copy foreign models, or require other countries to copy China's practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with Kissinger, the former U.S. Secretary of State, in New York, he said that China-U.S. cooperation would be win-win and the confrontation would be necessarily lose-lose.
The Chinese side was always committed to developing the long-term, healthy and stable China-U.S. relation and achieving no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
The State Council Information Office of the People’s Republic of China held a press conference on Tuesday to introduce and interpret the white paper of "The Facts and China’s Position on China-US Trade Friction".

ECNS, October 1 -- According to foreign media reports, Sulawesi, an Indonesian island, was hit by strong earthquake and tsunami on September 28, and many coastal cities were heavily damaged. The latest information showed that the death toll had rose to 1200.
According to the reports, the tsunami stroke Donggala in Palu twice since it was near the epicenter of the quake. After the "golden 72 hours" for rescue, the authority thought that the death toll would continue to rise.
On September 30, 2018 local time, the rescuers were carrying an earthquake survivor saved under the ruins of a restaurant in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.
An official from the disaster relief department said that the huge waves brought by tsunami were up to 6 meters high. The impacts of earthquake and tsunami had exceeded people's original estimation.
It was learned that hundreds of people were celebrating a festival on the beach when the earthquake and tsunami struck. Many people were swept away by huge waves and died.
An official said that the tsunami was moving towards the shore at 800 miles an hour, and a lot of buildings and infrastructures were destroyed.
He said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, and the debris flow caused by the tsunami cut off a major highway in Palu.
In Sulawesi, a bridge across a coastal river fell down.
On September 30, 2018 local time, Joko, the President of Indonesia, visited Palu in Central Sulawesi after the earthquake.
The Indonesian President Joko visited the disaster areas on September 30, and said that the troops had been sent out to assist the rescue. He also called for the victims to be patient.
Joko pointed out that it was very hard to carry out the rescue activities because of insufficient heavy-duty machines and people.
He heard that many disaster areas were short of drinking water, food, fuel and other materials, and many stores were closed after the earthquake. Therefore, planes were sent out to airlift supplies.
He called for the victims to be patient, and asked them to stay in the original location to wait for rescue.
The rescuers in Palu said they heard cries for help from a inside buried hotel, but they could do nothing because they didn't have heavy-duty machines to remove the rubbles. Some rescuers had to save people with their bare hands.
Kalla, the Vice President of Indonesia, said that the electricity and communication in some places were cut off, so the information was blocked. The number of deaths in this earthquake and tsunami might finally rise up to several thousands.

"Where can we take a taxi?
We'd like to go to the Golden Bauhinia Square to watch the National Day flag-raising ceremony! "
In the morning of October 1, Mr and Mrs Song, who specially flew from Ningxia to Shenzhen and transferred to the first train of Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link for National Day, accepted an interview of a reporter from China News at the West Kowloon station in Hong Kong and inquired such information.
In the morning of October 1, in order to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong SAR Government held a grand flag-raising ceremony at the Golden Bauhinia Square.
According to the statistics of the Immigration Control Point, as of September 30, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via the West Kowloon station of the high-speed railway have exceeded 300,000.
At the very time of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the West Kowloon boundary checkpoint predicts a peak of visitors to Hong Kong on October 1 and 2.
The reporter saw at the arrival lobby around 7:00 a.m. on October 1 that many mainland tourists took advantage of the National Day Golden Week, to take the high-speed rail and visit Hong Kong.
Mrs Song with light-footedness told the reporter that the National Day holiday was a rare long holiday in a year. It has always been her wish to come to the Golden Bauhinia Square in Hong Kong to watch the flag-raising ceremony. She felt very happy and excited to be able to accomplish this will on National Day.
But currently, the flights between Ningxia and Hong Kong are inconvenient. Thanks to the opening of the high-speed railway for the Hong Kong segment. Mr Song checked the train schedule and found that the first train could arrive at 7:03 a.m., and it was perfect timing for taking urban transportation means to the Golden Bauhinia Square.
He told the reporters, "the high-speed railway is very convenient, fast and on time! "
The 70 daily one-hour short-haul trains running between Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North, Futian and West Kowloon greatly facilitated the residents in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to visit Hong Kong.
After arriving in Hong Kong, Mr Liu, who lived in Shenzhen, was preparing to join his Hong Kong friends at the top of a hill in Central.
Mr Liu said, "both the mainland and Hong Kong have holidays on National Day. We intend to challenge ourselves and see if we can complete walking the 50-kilometer Hong Kong Trail! "
He explained that they would not dare to make such a long trek without the convenience and sufficient time brought about by the high-speed railway.
Mrs Yang, who came from Dongguan, took her 10-year-old son to come to Hong Kong to participate in the piano competition by taking the high-speed railway. She proudly told the reporter that her son had been studying piano for three years, and it was very meaningful to spend the National Day in this way.
She had previously come to Hong Kong by bus, but it was time-consuming and laborious. She was worried about affecting her son's condition. This time she came from Shenzhen by high-speed railway. The customs clearance was convenient and the time was reduced by half. She was more impressed by the trip in Hong Kong segment. She told the reporter, "it seems like taking the subway, which is very fast. I am not able to do take photos before arriving! "
At 6:44 a.m. on September 23, the G5711 "Harmony" high-speed train departed from Shenzhen North Railway Station and sped all the way. A few minutes later, the train entered the Hong Kong segment of Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link. This was the first formally operated high-speed train in the Hong Kong segment.
The Hong Kong segment of the high-speed railway, which integrates the national 25,000-kilometer high-speed rail network and reaches 38 long-distance stations throughout the country, also welcomes mainland tourists from different provinces far apart from each other.
Mr Gao, who took advantage of minor vacation to visit relatives in Hong Kong from Changsha, told the reporter that previously, the high-speed railway could only travel to Shenzhen North, and he needed to take the subway to pass through Hong Kong, and then take urban transportation means. It was troublesome and time-consuming to make transfers. Now, he can travel directly to the center of Kowloon and have lunch which was made by his children when getting home. He felt very happy.
He said that the "one port and two immigration inspection" customs clearance procedure were very convenient beyond imagination, and "passing both customs within 10 minutes. "
The West Kowloon Station, which is close to the Airport Express and connects land and air traffic, has also become the preferred destination for many transit passengers.
Miss Wu, from Fujian Province, prepared to spend the Golden Week with her friends traveling from Hong Kong to Philippines. Pushing her luggage out of the gate on time in West Kowloon, she told the reporter without hesitation, "I was afraid of not catching up with the plane, but I didn't think it would be so fast and that was more than enough! "
According to the subsidiary arrangement of the trade agreement published on Monday, the new U.S. -Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain the President Trump's ability to implement the threat to impose a 25% tariff on imported cars, while essentially exempting passenger cars, pickup trucks and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexico from paying tariffs.
If Trump imposes a so-called "Chapter 232" tariff on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Canada will have a tax-exempt quota of 2.6 million passenger cars exported to the United States each year.
According to the subsidiary arrangement, the pickup trucks manufactured in both countries will be fully exempted from tariffs.
If Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexico will receive a tax exemption quota of $108 billion each year for auto parts, and Canada will receive a quota of $32.4 billion.
These two quotas are far higher than the current production levels of the two countries, and provide their exports with growth space.
Report of Reuters on September 28 in Washington/Mexico: Mexico said on Friday that after days of debates, the U.S. President Trump's government and Canada were making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences, raising hopes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would maintain the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite lack of details, the obvious progress mentioned above is enough to prompt the Mexican and American governments to abruptly stop publishing the text of the two-party trade agreement and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the Mexican president-elect, told the reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government had made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said he would continue to urge these three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Ildefonso Guajardo, the Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs, said the time for submitting the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement to the legislation departments of Mexico and the United States had been delayed because the Canadian and American governments tried to reach an agreement "very seriously".
Guajardo said, "In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we will get a text of a tripartite agreement or have to publish the text of the two-party agreement. "
Guajardo said that the officials at the same level in the U.S. and Canada had "special requests" to postpone to publish the text.
The spokesman of the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the bilateral trade agreement between the United States and Mexico and the negotiations between the United States and Canada.
Officials of the Prime Minister's Office and the Office of Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
According to foreign media reports, it was hard for people to find anything unusual in two little lions playing in a conservation center located in the suburb in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, but they were absolutely unique.
University of Pretoria announced: "They are the first lions in the history, which are born by artificial insemination -- the first pair of lions in the world. "
The scientists of the university were committing themselves to studying the reproductive system of female African lions.
Ganswindt, the director of Mammal Institute of University of Pretoria, said that these two little lions born on August 25 were a female lion and a male lion. They were pretty healthy and quite normal.
After the intensive tests in 18 months, his team finally made this breakthrough.
Ganswindt said in a media interview: "We collected the sperms from a healthy male lion. "
Next, the researchers waited for the hormones in the female lion to reach a proper level so as to conduct the artificial insemination in it.
Ganswindt said: "Fortunately, the result turned out to be successful. "
He said that the researchers "tried many times, but to their surprise, it didn't take much effort".
He said that the above-mentioned research breakthrough could be verified repeatedly, and the scientists hoped to use this technology to save the endangered big cats.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature indicated that the lion had already become extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of survival wild lions had declined sharply by 43% in the past 20 years with only about 20,000 wild lions left.
The African lion was listed as vulnerable by this organization.
Ganswindt said: "This animal will be in danger of extinction if we do nothing for them. "
He said that with this kind of new technology, it's not necessary for the lions to be fed. The sperms could be injected into the bodies of female lions, just like the approach adopting on the elephants in captivity in North America and Europe.
The exports of South Korea fell the most in more than two years in September, but analysts put the blame of the decline on fewer working days and said that although the trade tension between China and the United States rose, the global demand for South Korean goods remained strong.
Indeed, the average daily exports of South Korea increased last month.
Moreover, the initial value data released earlier showed that the exports in first weeks of September during the long vacation had a double-digit increase.
The year-on-year drop of South Korean exports in September was the largest since July 2016, which was more than the decrease of 5.7% estimated by 11 analysts of Reuters surveys.
The initial value released on Monday showed that the amount of exports in September was $50.6 billion, lower than $51.2 billion in August.
Although the China-US trade disputes with intensifying concerns might cause other neighboring countries of China which depended on exports to suffer, Korean exports to China in September increased by 7.8%, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.
Since the sales of oil products declined, Korean exports to America decreased by 11.8%.
Although the market worried that the so-called "supercycle" of chips might reach the peak, the overseas sales of Korean memory chips and oil products increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively.
"However, the influence of trade conflicts cannot be avoided, because Korean exports considerably depend on American and Chinese markets. "
The imports decreased by 2.1% to $40.8 billion, inferior to the increase of 3.1% estimated by the Reuters survey.
The initial value of trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, higher than $6.9 billion in August.
The Department of Industry said that thanks to America and the EU countries, the global manufacturing would maintain buoyant, which was a favorable factor for Korean exports.
The statement pointed out, "the increasing export price caused by the rise of the oil price will be beneficial to the exports in the second half of this year. "
"However, the trade conflict between the United States and China continues and the market fluctuation after rising U.S. interest rates intensifies, which are both negative pressure on exports. "
The average exports of each working day in September increased to $2.6 billion, while the amount in August was $2.1 billion.
The Mid-Autumn Festival in South Korea this year was from September 24-26 so that there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
The Korean exports from January to September increased by 4.7% compared with that of the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers Index, activities of Korean manufacturing rose again in September which was supported by domestic orders, since Chinese and Japanese orders declined, which would probably cast a shadow over export prospects.
North Korean media criticized the United States for not easing the sanctions on North Korea.
North Korea's "Rodong Shinmun" published a signatured review article on September 30 to criticize the United States for not easing the sanctions on North Korea while seeking to have a dialogue with North Korea. The article said that it was a "self-contradictory" action.
The article said that Pompeo, the United States Secretary of State, indicated on September 14 that "the key to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was to impose the sanctions on North Korea" to emphasize that the United States would keep its position on implementing the UN resolution to impose sanctions.
In the North Korea-US Joint Statement of Singapore, the two sides promised to build a new North Korea-US relation, which complied with the two peoples' wishes of looking forward to peace and prosperity.
On one side, the United States increased the intensity of sanctions, but on the other side, it asked for the dialogue. Undoubtedly, its actions were self-contradictory.
According to the article, if it wanted to build a new North Korea-US relation, establish a permanently consolidated system of peace in the Korean Peninsula, and achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it would put building trust in the first place, start from what can be done, and solve the problems by stages.
The article also said that the United States should understand that it wouldn't work to impose sanctions on North Korea.
The article said that even the "Severodvinsk" preceded the "Kazan" was admired by the U.S. military.
The National Interest quotes the view of US Navy as saying, "we will encounter a strong potential opponent. It is enough to see the "Severodvinsk" submarine only. "
Foggo, the current commander in chief of the U.S. navy in Europe, also highly praised the "Severodvinsk" submarine.
He said, "this submarine is impressive. Look at the development of Russian navy and how they utilize resources and it will be known that their main efforts on the fields of research and development are firstly to strenghten the submarine fleet. "
However, the National Interest still considers the United States maintains the advantage against Russia in this field.
Foggo said, "I believe that western countries still have asymmetrical advantages. "
Previously, it was informed that the Russian navy would equip the "Kazan" submarine in 2019.
The multipurpose submarines of "Kazan", "Novosibirsk", "Krasnoyarsk" and "Arkhangelsk" are all of "Fraxinus-M" improved type, with displacement of 13,800 tons, depth of 520 m, staffing of 64, submerged speed of 31 knots. All the submarines will carry mines, torpedoes and "Kalibr" and "Onyx" cruise missiles.

Ignore the Threat of America!
EU may Reach Crude Oil Purchase Agreement with Iran
The US government announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November and even urge other countries to reduce imports of Iran oil.
However, the American allies did not seem to take the advice.
According to the US "New York Times", on 29th, during the interview, Zarif, Foreign Minister of Iran, revealed that although the United States threatened to sanction any country that does business with Iran, Tehran is approaching to reach an agreement on the sale of crude oil with EU.
The core purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, which is to replace the dollar transaction in the form of barter or domestic currency.
The purpose of this approach is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from impeding financial transfers.
Meanwhile, although the EU is working on facilitating the agreement, some French and British officials are also worried that if the agreement is concluded, it will be the most overt confrontation between the EU and the United States against the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.
The US media said that in the one hour interview , Zarif’s words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement can "strip" the traditional American allies and effectively break the US’s attempts to cut Iran’s income.
"This can guarantee that we can sell oil and obtain benefits", Zarif believed. According to the agreement reached in 2015, each country has the legal rights to make trade contacts with Iran.
The head of Union for Foreign Affairs Policy, Federica Mogherini, also said recently that "no sovereign state or organization can accept other people to decide who they can trade with. "
However, she also predicted that before the US government carried out the next step of sanctions in November, US leaders could adopt a series of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries that have commercial intercourses with Tehran.
In May of this year, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that the agreement had deficiencies, saying that the agreement could not permanently prohibit Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US then threatened to ban companies that buy Iran oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
This threat forced some companies to leave Tehran and made the Iranian currency dropped sharply.
Companies such as Airbus S.A.S. and French oil giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iran.
British and French officials said, the US government may "take the lead".
Unsurprisingly, according to a recent report by the Turkish media, the US sanctions did not seem to have a major impact on Iran’s oil exports.
Recently, Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh disclosed that no country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iran oil.
Both Zarif and Iran President Rouhani believed that the purpose of a series of US actions is to "seduce" Iran’s breach of the agreement.
Zarif also regarded the US serial blast as not worthy of consideration. When asked if the US would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed. "It is a regime change strategy, and this is the true purpose of the US. "

The reporter learned from the National Health Commission that the prevalence of malnutrition in our children and adolescents had reduced but the prevalence of overweight-obesity had significantly increased comparing to decades ago.
The expert pointed out that the most important concept to maintain a healthy weight was the "preventive treatment of disease". The scientific fitness and rational diet should be vigorously promoted.
According to the "Core Information on Health Education of Chinese Adolescents and Interpretation (2018 version)" released by the National Health Commission recently, the key to maintain a healthy weight was the rational diet and scientific movement.
The overweight, obesity and blind weight reduction were harmful to health.
The health hazard behind the "chubby children" couldn't be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, the head of National Institute for Nutrition and Health of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight-obesity could harm the adolescents' normal growth and development, have a negative impact on their mentality, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and even cause hypertension, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in children.
And the adolescents' overweight-obesity might continue into adulthood, which would increase the adolescents' risk of having chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes in their adulthood.
Ding Gangqiang said that the overweight rate was 9.6% and the obesity rate was 6.4% among Chinese children and adolescents of 6-17 years old according to the Nutrition and Health Status Inspection of Chinese Residents in 2010-2012. The sum of these two rates was 16%.
Meanwhile, the characteristics of overweight-obesity among children and adolescents were that the overweight-obesity rate was higher in boys than in girls, and it was higher in cities than in villages. The overweight-obesity rate had significantly increased in recent decades.
How would the adolescents deal with the overweight-obesity?
Zhang Li, the deputy director of Science Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of General Administration of Sport of China, indicated that the primary causes of adolescent obesity at present were excessive caloric intake and inadequate physical activity.
For this kind of simple obesity, we should lay emphasis on scientific movement and reasonable diet control.
Zhang Li pointed out that the most important concept to maintain a healthy weight was the "preventive treatment of disease", and an integral part of it was to conduct the all-round science popularization education of schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and increase the adolescents' self-protection awareness.
The adolescents should take the periodic physical examination to monitor the growth and development index, such as height and weight, so that the problems of overweight and obesity could be discovered early and determined scientifically to take intervention measures in time.
For those adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang advised that starvation therapy or semi-starvation therapy should be avoided to control and lose weight in addition to the active and scientific arrangement of diet and movement since the adolescents are in a special physiological stage. They should not take drugs blindly to lose weight.

China News Service, Yichang, October 1 (reported by Guo Xiaoying and Liu Min) -- The newly revised "Three Gorges-Gezhouba Hydro Project Navigation Scheduling Regulation" (hereinafter referred to as "Scheduling Regulation") was officially enforced starting from October 1. After two years of navigation test, the Three Gorges ship lift was officially scheduled together with the navigation lock in a unified way.
On the first day of enforcing the new regulations, the navigation in Three Gorges-Gezhouba waters was in good order.
Three Gorges Navigation Authority released the first plan of security check at 21:00 on September 30, and carried out the security check on 160 ships, with 124 ships passing the security check.
The navigation authority arranged the first locking plan after the enforcement of new regulations at 14:00 on October, 1.
After the enforcement of new regulations, the plan of security check would be released once every day at 9:00 and 21:00, and the plan of passing dam would be released once every day at 14:00 and 20:00, so that the ships could flexibly arrange the plan of passing dam.
The "Classification Control" scheduling principle of ship passing dam was added in the "Scheduling Regulation". The priority of ship passing dam would be determined according to the functional localization of navigation lock and ship lift respectively. The short-term passenger ship passing dam would be adjusted to be in the same priority as the demonstration ship and integrity ship.
This is also the official scheduling of ship lift and navigation lock after the two-year navigation test of ship lift.
It was also the first time for big length-width demonstration ship and new energy driven ship of Chuanjiang River and Three Gorges Reservoir Region to be ranked in the priority.

And the "core waters", "water close to dam", "control waters" and "scheduling waters" were divided.
This action would help the ship choose the proper waters to wait for crossing the lock, avoiding excessive ships waiting for crossing the lock in the dam region.
The "Scheduling Regulation" also put forward the measures of integrity constraint for the rule-breaking ships according to the current characteristics of ship passing dam and waiting for crossing lock, such as canceling the declaration and delaying the time of passing dam for 24 hours.
After water storing of the Three Gorges, the navigation condition of the reservoir area was improved, accelerating the rapid development of shipping in Yangtze River.
According to data, the annual cargo throughput of Three Gorges ship lock and Gezhouba ship lock was increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 0.138 billion tons and 0.14 billion tons in 2017 respectively.
During the two-year navigation test of ship lift, 5767 ships and 0.1622 million people have passed, and the volume of goods transported was 1.7128 million tons.

Signed and approved by Premier Li Keqiang, the State Council printed and distributed the "Decision of the State Council on Further Reducing the Categories in the Catalogue of Industrial Products Subject to Production License Administration and Simplifying the Approval Procedures".
The "Decision" proposed to further reduce the categories in the catalogue of industrial products subject to production license administration, cancel the production license administration for 14 industrial products, and delegate the administration authority for production licenses of 4 types of industrial products to the quality and technical supervision departments of provincial people’s governments.
After this reform, the products that implement the industrial product production licenses administration will be reduced from last year’s 38 categories to the current 24 categories.
The "Decision" clearly simplifies the approval process for products in the catalogue.
First, the pre-certification product inspection organized by the issuing authority is changed to the product inspection conformity report issued by the qualified inspection and testing institution when the enterprise applies.
Second, in addition to dangerous chemicals, the products that have been licensed by the quality and technical supervision department (market supervision and management department) of the provincial people’s government shall be subject to post-site inspection. After the enterprise submits the application and product inspection conformity report and makes a commitment to ensure product quality and safety, the production license can be obtained after passing the formal examination, and then the on-site examination is accepted within the specified time.
Third, for enterprises produce different types of products in the production and operation catalogue, in accordance with the principle of "one enterprise, one license", when apply for a new license or apply for a license renewal, a license should be issued and examined.
The "Decision" requires that all regions and relevant departments should solidly promote the reduction of catalogue and simplify the examination and approval procedures.
Increase the commitment publicity of enterprises and post-site inspection work, strengthen credit supervision and restraint means, implement the responsibility of the main body of the enterprise, and revoke the production license for false promises and non-compliance.
For the products that cancel the production licenses administration for industrial products, it is necessary to strengthen the post supervision, and the products related to public health and safety, environmental protection, etc. can be converted into compulsory certification, list positive lists and publicize to the public, unify the certification standards and reasonably reduce and merge the certification and testing items, and the compulsory certification fees in principle should be borne by the financial institutions at all levels.
Take support measures to encourage enterprises to carry out voluntary certification and promote brand building and market expansion.
It is necessary to benchmark the international advanced standards and promote the quality of industrial products.
Give full play to the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality and safety of industrial products.
For products that retain industrial product production license administration, it is necessary to improve the standard system, give play to the advantages of industry supervision, strengthen the responsibility of "who approves and who supervise", dynamically assess product quality and safety risks, timely reduce catalogues, delegate approval authority or convert to certification administration.

Report of Reuters on November 5 in Nagoya: Haruhiko Kuroda, the president of the Bank of Japan said on Monday that the bank realized that the long-term implementation of ultra-easing monetary policy could squeeze the profit margins of financial institutions and destabilize the banking system of Japan.
However, he said that due to the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needed to maintain its large-scale incentive plans and pay close attention to the pros and cons of its policies.
"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under the sustained monetary easing policy, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected," Haruhiko Kuroda said in a speech to the business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions were more active in taking risks to compensate for the effect of low interest rates on shrinking profit margins over the years, the banking system could be unstable in the event of serious negative impacts.
"Although these risks are not too big at present, the Bank of Japan will closely monitor the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take necessary measures," he said.
The minutes released by the Bank of Japan earlier on Monday showed that the policy committee of the Bank of Japan discussed the problem of rising costs of the long-term easing policy at the interest rate meeting in September.
The minutes showed that a member of the board said that if the economy continued to expand, "the Bank of Japan will have more flexibility in the aspect of policy in the future. "
The minutes showed that another member of the board said that due to the limits of policy duration, the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan can maintain the incentive policy.
Haruhiko Kuroda said that the Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks brought by the easing policy, and take into account the uncertainties centered on Japan's economic prospects, as China-U.S. trade frictions and rising protectionism might affect the global demand.
"The impact of such problems on Japan's economy is temporarily limited," Haruhiko Kuroda said.
"But if the problem persists, the impact on Japan's economy may increase," he added.
"It is necessary to sustain the strong monetary easing policy and consider both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner," Haruhiko Kuroda said.
Although the disadvantages of radical incentive plans were increasing, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, the low inflation forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Bank of Japan maintained the monetary policy last month; Haruhiko Kuroda ruled out the possibility of recent interest rate increase about the risks brought by the conflict of the global trade war.
On June 1, 2018, in Cardiff, the United States, the corporate identity on Tesla electric cars.
According to a settlement agreement, Tesla Motors and its CEO, Musk, had agreed to separately pay $20 million fines to the financial regulators, and Musk would resign as President of the company, but still held the post of CEO.
This settlement agreement would end two months of unrest in Tesla.
This settlement agreement on securities fraud charge released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Saturday would make investors relieved.
Investors were originally worried that the protracted legal battle would only further hit the electric car company, which was still losing money.
SEC prosecuted Musk for frauds on Thursday, saying that his tweet on August 7 misled the investors.
The tweet said that he was considering to privatize Tesla with $420 per share and had obtained financing.
SEC said that these tweets actually had no evidences and the volatility in market triggered by them had hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts said that this agreement could strengthen Tesla, which had been hit hard by Musk's recent actions.
Steven Heim, the leader of assets management company of Boston Common, said that this settlement agreement should let Musk receive more monitoring, but had not taken any "destructive" measures to throw him out of Tesla.
This assets management company held shares of Panasonic, the battery manufacturer of Tesla.
According to this proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint a independent president, two independent directors and a board committee to set out controls aiming at Musk’s external communications.
"This matter was resolved promptly according to the agreed conditions, which met the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
The charge on Thursday caused the market value of Tesla evaporate about $7 billion. The market value of this company was $45.2 billion, lower than $47.5 billion of General Motors.
SEC withdrew the requirement for throwing Musk out of the head position of the company.
Many investors said that this punishment would be catastrophic.
"I think it is the best possible result for all relevant staff," Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial Partners said. Feinseth gave a "neutral" evaluation to Tesla and said that the punishment of SEC was a "lighter punishment" to Musk.
"The fact that he still holds the position of CEO is very important to Tesla. "
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the charge of SEC in the settlement agreement, or immediately replied to the request for commenting.
The settlement agreement still needed to get approval of the court.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private sector symposium, injecting a firm confidence into the broader stage of the private economy.
General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that "letting entrepreneurs unload their mental loads and march with light packs", which has a strong resonance among entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the magnificent course of the 40 years of reform and opening up, there are thousands of entrepreneurs entrepreneurship and innovation stories, the growth and expansion of entrepreneurs-group constantly push the Chinese economy to sail far.
For some time, some people in the society have published some remarks that negate and doubt the private economy.
The so-called "private economic departure theory" and "new public-private partnership theory" and other misconceptions have caused some entrepreneurs’ doubts and concerns.
Recently, some private enterprise have encountered many difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, the changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises; the rapid adjustment of the demand structure has brought about the pressure of transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated with each other, the policy effects are superimposed in the same direction, or the working methods are simple, resulting in some policies with good original intentions have the opposite effect, etc.
All kinds of factors are intertwined, the private economy is facing difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety.
Under this context, it is particularly profound and practical to correct the cognition errors, let the entrepreneurs’ unload the mental load, let them develop wholeheartedly, make the government promote development devotedly and concern market confidence and development expectations.
This symposium once again emphasized the important assertion of the "Three no-changes": "There is no change in the role and function of non-public sector in our economic and social development"!
In recent years, from deepening the promotion of streamline administration and delegate more power to lower-level governments, establishing a power list system, and creating a legal environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a market environment of fair competition and shaping the atmosphere of respecting entrepreneurs in the whole society, the Party Central Committee has attached unprecedented emphasis on entrepreneurs and institutional guarantees.
The symposium clearly stated the six aspects’ policy measures to vigorously support the development and expansion of private enterprises, and launched a series of pragmatic actions dedicated to the "march with light packs" of private enterprises.
These actions have greatly encouraged the entrepreneurial community and have given more expectations to the community.
The fog has been set aside, and the policy has been set. And the key aspect lies in implementation.
We must continue to create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve the difficulties in development, and help achieve China’s economic transformation and upgrading; let entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legal operations, and feel respected in social life, stimulate innovation and create potential.
The Chinese economy has stepped into a process of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to display their ambitions and providing more spaces and stages for entrepreneurs to exert their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening reforms and removing obstacles, the private economy will greet better development prospects and opportunities and move toward a broader stage.

Exports of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China surged 20 times in four years, which may be related to the increase of empty-nest youth - China News
Exports of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China surged 20 times in four years; analysis: it is related to the increase of empty-nest youth
According to the report on Day 5 of Yonhap, last year, the export sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China exceeded 100,000 US dollars, which surged 20 times compared with that of four years ago, in 2013.
The analysis suggests that this growth is related to the hot sales of convenience food driven by the increasing number of empty-nest youth in China, as well as the increasing attention of young people on nutritious meals.
This data is published by the Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corp (aT) on Day 5.
Last year, the export sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China was 100,339 US dollars and the weight was 21,859 kg, which surged by 2094% and 3668.8 % respectively compared with that in 2013.
The analysis suggests that the increasing sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup in China are related to the hot sales of convenience food driven by the increasing number of empty-nest youth in China, as well as the increasing attention of young people on nutritious meals.
By the end of this year, the number of one-person households in China have exceeded 200 million, and it is expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020. Local food enterprises are also aiming at the “eating-alone people" and launching various convenience food.
Moreover, the analysis also indicates that bird flu is the biggest factor which prevents ginseng chicken soup from taking root in the Chinese mainland market.
aT says that bird flu outbroke in South Korea from November 2016 to April of last year. Relevant departments comprehensively ban the export of ginseng chicken soup to China which leads to sharp reduction of export sales.
In 2016, the export sales of ginseng chicken soup in China was 840,000 US dollars. Due to bird flu, the export sales of last year plummeted to 100,000 US dollars.

A gateway flag-raising ceremony is held in Hekou port on China-Vietnam boarder to celebrate the National Day.
"I didn't expect to see such a spectacular flag-raising ceremony on the frontier. It is more amazing to watch the flag-raising here than in the mainland. "
In the morning of October 1, Mr Zhang, who came from Sichuan to visit Hekou port in Yunnan on China-Vietnam boarder, watched the gateway flag-raising ceremony together with more than 500 army officers and soldiers, local people, and Chinese and foreign tourists to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Hekou port is the biggest port on China-Vietnam boarder in Yunnan. It is located in Hekou county in Honghe Prefecture in Yunnan Province with just a river away from Lao Cai City in Vietnam. It is a first-class national port.
With the continuous enhancement of "One Belt and One Road" construction in China, as one of the most convenient passage connecting China and Southeast Asia, Hekou port has a steady growth of departure and entry flow.
At 7:30 in the early morning of the same day, a ray of sunshine just showed in the sky. The local people and Chinese and foreign tourists had gathered in the restricted areas in Hekou port very early to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 7:45, the flag-raising ceremony started on time. The members of gateway honor guard of Hekou Frontier Inspection Station were in high spirits and walked with vigorous steps escorting the national flag to the flag tower.
After the flag-raising command made by the commander, the flag raiser waved his arm hard to draw an arc. The bright five-star red flag stretched out like an "eagle stretching its wings", and rose slowly with the melody of the majestic and impassioned national anthem.
"It not only shows China's image, but also inspires the patriotism among people of all nationalities in border areas to held a flag-raising ceremony on every New Year's day, Spring Festival, National Day, and other time nodes of great significance. "
A member of the honor guard taking part in this flag-raising ceremony said.
It is reported that the gateway honor guard taking charge of flag-raising ceremony in Hekou port is made up of more than 40 officials and soldiers coming from various positions of Hekou Frontier Inspection Station. From a 3-member flag-raising team to a large-scale honor guard, it has developed in more than 60 years. Since its establishment, it has performed more than 70 national-level tasks in foreign affairs as the honor guard.
The newly revised Individual Income Tax Law will adjust the criterion for resident taxpayers of China’s Individual Income Tax Law from one year to 183 days.
On 30th, the relevant principals from the Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China and State Administration of Taxation said that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
The principals expressed that the current effective Individual Income Tax Law’s enforcement regulations have special preferential provisions for taxation issues for foreigners. For individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived for more than one year and less than five years and earn incomes from outside China, their part of the payment by domestic units or individuals is subject to individual income tax.
The portion of the overseas payment does not need to pay personal income tax in China.
The Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China, the State Administration of Taxation, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Commerce also issued notices to expand the scope of application of no withholding income tax policy for overseas investors with distribution of profit investment.
For the profit distributed by overseas investors from domestic enterprises in China used for the scope of application of no withholding income tax policy for domestic direct investment, the foreign investment encouraged projects should be extended to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and fields.
During the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, the parties released some positive information for the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in related the "irreversible" denuclearisation determination as told by the DPRK and said that US President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year.
The US State Department subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeo will visit the DPRK in October to promote the implementation of the US-DPRK leadership meeting in Singapore.
From the beginning of this year to the present, the DPRK and the ROK broke the ice and opened the dialogue, and the DPRK - ROK and the DPRK-US leaders held meetings. The general trend of the easing of the peninsula has been continued, and the dialogue’s principle of solving the peninsula issue has also been adhered to.
First of all, the fact that "the essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue" has not changed. The key to realizing peace on the peninsula is to resolve the reasonable security concerns of all parties in a proper and balance manner, instead of putting pressure on the other side and stressing own demands.
Secondly, in the dialogue to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned are still divided on the steps and ways to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula. Due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the game thinking of "who is first and who is second" is still strong.
At the public meeting of the UN Security Council Korean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the two points on the peninsula that have not changed.
Pompeo, US Secretary of State, insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula is fully denuclearized.
Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister, stressed the principle of "responding to action by action". He pointed out: "The weakening trend of sanctions should be in synchronization with the pace taken by North Korea on the road of gradual denuclearization."
Undoubtedly, all parties concerned should continue to implement the North Korea related resolutions of the UN Security Council in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner. However, pressuring is not an end. The implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are all requirements of the UN Security Council resolutions. The two cannot be neglected, and cannot only choose one
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in the DPRK-ROK and DPRK-US relations, China believes that it is necessary for the UN Security Council to consider launching reversible clauses in a timely manner, thereby encouraging North Korea and relevant parties to take a big move toward denuclearization.
Review the past, every development in the denuclearization of the peninsula and in the peace process requires the parties to demonstrate sufficient political courage.
At present, in the face of the international community’s increasingly high expectations for promoting a political solution to the peninsula issue, all parties concerned should demonstrate political courage, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve problems, and continue to take the opposite direction and advance peninsula denuclearization process and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula to jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.
A message from Ji County People's Government in Linfen City in Shanxi Province on October 1 indicated that the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River located in this county would maintain higher levels of water during the National Day holiday, so it didn't meet the requirements to be open to the public.
In order to ensure the safety, the scenic areas will be temporarily closed during the National Day holiday.
Hukou Falls of Yellow River is the second biggest fall in China, and the biggest yellow fall in the world.
The Yellow River flows here at great speed, and the stone walls on both sides are rising steeply. The river mouth becomes narrow like the spout of kettle, forming the situation that "a thousand miles of Yellow River seems like to be collected into a kettle".
The reporter learned that the flood season of yellow river would come in every June to October. Due to high levels of water, the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River in Shanxi Province had been closed one after another since July 12, 2018. Therefore, according to the accumulative calculation, Hukou scenic areas had been closed for nearly a month.
Ni Yufeng, the chief engineer of Hukou Scenic Areas Management Committee, said to the media that it was the longest time for the Yellow River to keep high levels of water during the past 20 years. "It hasn't been closed for such a long time. We closed it for four days in the flood season in 2017. However, it has been closed for nearly a month. "
It was learned that the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River in Shanxi Province had originally arranged extra staff and vehicle maintenance in advance in order to be well-prepared for the "National Day" golden week, and even the temporary staff had been hired.
According to the "Notice on Being Well-prepared for the Flood Control in the Yellow River during the National Day Holiday" issued in the "Office Telegram of Yellow River Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters", Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong were required to be well-prepared for the flood control in the Yellow River during the National Day holiday.
Currently, the flow of the main stream of the Yellow River is relatively large. The upstream river flow is maintained at 2000-3000 cubic meters per second, the midstream river flow is maintained at 2500―3500 cubic meters per second, and the downstream river flow is maintained at 3000 cubic meters per second.
The health center and the health station specially provide influenza vaccination services during the National Day Holidays
The health station has ordered 150,000 doses of the 2018-2019 four-strain flu vaccine this year and at this stage, free vaccination is preferentially provided for high-risk people. To facilitate the citizens to vaccinate with flu vaccine during the holiday, all the health centers and health stations under the Health Bureau will specially provide vaccination services from 9 am to 1 pm during the National Day Holidays ( October 1 through 2).
In addition to the above-mentioned convenience measures, all the health centers and health stations under the Health Bureau have extended their influenza vaccination service time to 8 pm from Monday to Friday. By 4 pm on September 30, 4,158 people had been vaccinated, which was more than that of the same period last year for 3,714 people.
Free vaccination objects include the following Macao residents: people under the age of 6 months to 18 years, people at the age of 50 and above, pregnant women, all patients with chronic diseases (including fat people, namely, the persons whose body mass index (BMI) is 30 or more), staff of institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools and middle schools, all the health workers and the Macao residents who work in the casino.
Meanwhile, for the other people who are considered to be necessary to vaccinate by the Health Bureau, including the personnel of the public sectors, the Health Bureau will take the initiative to contact the relevant authorities to obtain the list and then the health centers will arrange them for vaccination.
To facilitate the vaccinees and reduce the waiting time for vaccination, the Health Bureau will send medical staff to Macao middle schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries from October to December to perform collective influenza vaccination to the children, students, teachers and staff; in addition, the Health Bureau will also arrange staff to go to the institutions of the elderly and disabled, public sectors or other institutions with a large number of people to perform collective influenza vaccination.
Students and children who fail to participate in the collective vaccination can take Macao resident identity cards, user cards of the Health Bureau, influenza vaccination cards (if any), student identity cards, employee identity cards or occupational certificates to the vaccination station of the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário or health centers from December 3, 2018.
The Health Bureau reminds residents that people who vaccinated with the 2017-2018 flu vaccine during September 2017 and August 2018 still need to vaccinate with the new seasonal flu vaccine from September 2018, since the flu antigen composition of 2018-2019 flu vaccine in the Northern Hemisphere has been updated , which is targeted at the seasonal influenza in winter of 2018-2019 and summer of 2019 in the Northern Hemisphere.
The peak of influenza in Macao usually occurs from January till March every year, later than that of the temperate regions (such as Northern China and Japan). The Health Bureau urges the elderly, children, pregnant women, fat people and chronic patients who are at high risk of complications after being infected with influenza and people who are in regular contact with high-risk people to get vaccinated as soon as possible.

Report of Reuters on October 1 in Tokyo: A quarterly Tankan survey report released by the Bank of Japan on Monday showed that the confidence of Japanese major manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year for that season in September, as raw material costs rose and a series of natural disasters affected production, putting pressure on enterprises.
This survey almost didn’t show that the escalating global trade frictions shook the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, risks of outbreak of an all-out trade war stuck the business prospects of enterprises, likely to threaten the business capital expenditure.
The active capital expenditure is a highlight of Japanese economy.
This survey raised questions about the view of the Bank of Japan on that robust economic expansion would help to accelerate inflation to the 2% target, although there were signs that enterprises were gradually shifting costs to the customers.
"With concerns raised by the global trade war, as exports slowed down and factory production weakened, the confidence of manufacturers tended to stagnate," said Takeshi Minami, the Principal Researcher of Norinchukin Research Institute Co., Ltd..
"Confident is still at a high level. And since corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline. "
The Tankan survey showed that the judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing declined from positive 21 for three months ago to positive 19 in September, worsening for the third consecutive quarter.
The median market forecast is positive 22.
The judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing declined from positive 24 researched in June to positive 22 in September, worsening for the first time for eight quarters.
The survey of Reuters was positive 22.
The survey showed that the judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing was expected to remain stable in December.
Investors were indifferent to the decline of the judgment index for the boom of Tankan enterprises. The Nikkei .N225 rose to a 27-year high spot on Monday as the continued depreciation of the yen helped improve the export profit prospects of Japanese enterprises.
The capital expenditure was robust.
Although the confidence of enterprises declined, the latest Tankan highlighted the robustness of enterprise capital expenditure plans, benefiting from the renewed capacity and increased investment in robots and automation to cope with the labor shortage caused by the aging of population.
The Tankan survey of the Bank of Japan showed that the capital expenditure of large-scale enterprise plans would increase by 13.4% for the fiscal year ended in March 2019.
It was 13.6% for previous Tankan survey.
Takeshi Minami said that the capital expenditure of all enterprise plans for this fiscal year increased by 8.5%, close to the pace of Japan’s bubble era.
He said, "considering that small businesses raise their profit estimates from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital expenditure, but that largely depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence. "
The Tankan survey showed that the ability of enterprises to pass on costs was enhanced. The output price index of large enterprises was positive 7, which was a 10-year high spot. It was an encouraging sign, reflecting that Japan had made progress in its efforts to combat deflation.
The index measuring the employment situation of large enterprises hit negative 23, which was the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
Benefiting from the robust enterprise expenditure, Japanese economy rebounded from January-March shrink in the second quarter.
However, the escalation of trade frictions in summer and the disturbance of natural disasters on supply chains had casted a shadow over the prospects of Japanese economy which depended on exports.
In dollar terms, import and export of services increase by 16.4%.

Subsequently, the OPEC Production Cut Conference explicitly refused to increase production, giving market confidence to believe that the oil prices will move up steadily. "
Zhuochuang Information refined oil product analyst Zang Wengang said.
In terms of retail sales, the prices of gasoline at No. 92 and No. 95 of Beijing CNPC and Sinopec gas stations are 7.66 yuan/liter and 8.15 yuan/liter respectively.

Report of Reuters on November 5 in Beijing: According to a press release released on Sunday by the China Foreign Trade Center, the Canton Fair showed that the situation of China's foreign trade was still complex and serious, with expectation of 80.6% of enterprises exports in 2018 to be better than or maintain at the same level as last year.
However, in consideration of the rising costs of domestic raw materials, labor force and other comprehensive factors, as well as the external environment of the increasing impact of Sino-US trade frictions, exhibitors also believed that the export situation of next year was not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, the deputy secretary-general and spokesman of the Canton Fair, and the vice-director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions of this Canton Fair had declined slightly compared with the same period of last year.
The number of buyers who attended this Canton Fair was 189,812 and they came from 215 countries and regions, with a decrease of 1.11% on year-on-year basis.
The amount of export transactions was 206.494 billion yuan ($29.86 billion), with a decrease of 1% on year-on-year basis.
From the perspective of the market, the transactions with Japan, the ten ASEAN countries, "the BRICS countries" and Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, while the transactions with traditional markets of the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.
From the perspective of the industry, the transactions of transportation tools, machinery and equipment, building and decorative materials, electronic consumer goods, information products, and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0% and 15.1% respectively, while the transactions with textile clothing and household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer and weathervane of China's foreign trade, the buyers’ participation situation and the export transaction data of this Canton Fair showed that China's foreign trade development would still face many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reform and the "six stability" policies and measures recently introduced by the state and local governments in succession, the new drivers for the development of China’s foreign trade was accelerating the accumulation, and the diversification of enterprises and markets had made new progress, all of which were the important foundation and strong conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Taking all factors into consideration, it is expected that the imports and exports of China's foreign trade will maintain a steady growth throughout the year, with further improvement in quality and efficiency. " Xu Bing said.
The China’s General Administration of Customs published that priced in dollars, the exports in September increased by 14.5% on year-on-year basis, the imports increased by 14.3% on year-on-year basis, the trade surplus in September was $31.69 billion, and the export growth rate and trade surplus in September were the highest since February.
In despite of the escalating trade frictions between China and the United States, China's export performance in September still significantly exceeded expectation. Strong external demand, and the enterprises rushing to export before imposing tariffs in the United States and the depreciation of RMB exchange rate, might be the main supporting factors, and also showed the resilience of China's foreign trade to a certain extent. However, the impact of the Sino-US trade war on confidence and the industrial chain can not be neglected. Analysts believed that the challenges for China's foreign trade might emerge in the fourth quarter or next year.
Reuters surveys showed that the U.S. fund managers proposed to increase cash holdings and stood the cautious ground in September, since the United States and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs and there was no sign of dispute easing.
However, according to the suggestion of 12 fund managers who participated in this survey, the asset allocation in North America rose to the highest level since June 2017, while positions in Britain, the Eurozone and particularly emerging markets declined.
The average of global stock allocation accounted for 56.6% and the bonds accounted for 35.5%, which was basically consistent with the survey of last month.
The most obvious change was that the cash ratio rose to 5.1%, which was the highest proportion since December 2014.
A fund manager of a large fund company said, "Some economic data have brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so that it's better to get prepared to enter when the market falls after a rise. "
However, the fund managers still preferred stocks in September, especially American stocks, even though the price of American stocks were considered to be on the high side.
Today, in Shanghai, the opening-up landmark of China, China International Import Expo (CIIE), the world's first large-scale state-level exhibition with the theme of import, has officially opened in much anticipation.
An exhibition is like a "window" which can let the world know a city and a country better.
Through the "window" of CIIE, people can see the "opening-up China" which moves towards a higher level; with the help of the "window" of CIIE, we welcome the world and China which is "restarting from reform and opening-up", to achieve mutual benefits and win-win results.
"For a country, opening-up is like coming out of the cocoon and becoming a butterfly. There will be pain, but there will be new life. "
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of Open Road reveals an important reason "why China can do it".
Looking back on the past 40 years of reform and opening-up, China dares to plunge into the vast sea of the world market. Although it has encountered whirlpool and storm, it always faces all risks and challenges with an open attitude, constantly releases its endogenous driving force and continuously improves its competitiveness.
So to speak, China has fully demonstrated the value and significance of opening-up with its solid achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point, it is a major decision to hold an expo with the theme of import made by the Party Central Committee with the core of Comrade Xi Jinping with a view to promoting a new round of high-level opening to the outside world. It is a major measure for China to actively open the market to the world and is also a practical action taken by China to support the economic globalization and trade liberalization, showing a strong and clear will that "China's opening door won't close, but would open wider and wider".
Exhibitors from all over the world are eager to enroll in the exhibition, and "it is difficult to apply for a stand", which is the greatest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a larger scope, a wider range of fields and at a deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroad.
Some countries have built trade protectionist walls and retreated into the unilateralism, which increases anxiety of the international society about the prospects for free trade and adds much uncertainty to a recovering world economy.
Under such era background, this grand gathering along the Huangpu River demonstrates China's guard to free trade and shows the world China's confidence and responsibility to open its markets and share its future.
It is fast to go alone but it is further to go in crowds.
By embracing the world with an open mind, China has not only vigorously promoted its own development, but also brought about tremendous "China opportunities" to other countries and regions.
In recent years, by advocating and promoting the joint development of the "One Belt and One Road", initiating and setting up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and establishing the Silk Road fund... China has provided a series of international public goods, a solid export market, development opportunities and jobs, allowing companies of various countries to get a ride on the "express train" and take "hitchhiking" of China's development.
CIIE is also this kind of public goods and a big platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have made their debut with high-quality products and services with distinctive features, taking a new step into the Chinese market.
Apart from companies of various countries, the real beneficiaries are domestic consumers.
By building the platform of "selecting the best and importing the best", we can provide multiple channels of high-quality supply for consumption upgrading and meet people's personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs.
As China's opening-up door opens wider and wider, the goods flow is smooth and materials are put to good use, thus the pace towards a better life will be more solid.
From a broader perspective, the significance of CIIE has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade. It has the future in mind, conveys the concepts of openness, inclusiveness, universal benefit, balance and win-win, and forms a consensus to jointly meet today's challenges.
Only when the world is doing well can China do well; when China is good, the world is better.
We expect CIIE to make the world wonderful and complete; we are looking forward to the bright future that an "opening-up China" moving to a higher level and the world build a community of human destiny.
Foreign media report that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Abstract] The content of the Agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and a temporary suspension of U.S. tariffs on the cars produced in Canada.
It is reported by foreign media that a Canadian source said in the evening of September 30 at local time that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It is revealed that the content of the Agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and a temporary suspension of U.S. tariffs on the cars produced in Canada.
On Day 27 of last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary principled agreement on updating the North American Free Trade Agreement while the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement before the deadline set by the American side of August 31 and extended the negotiation deadline to September 30.
Previously, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said that Canada would only sign a favorable agreement, and "the focus is on substance rather than timetables. We will continue to consult in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in line with the national interests of Canada. "
Over 90% of Brazilian female voters said that the presidential candidate did not consider women’s needs.
According to the Overseas Chinese News Network of South America, data released by Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) recently showed that more than 90% of Brazilian women do not think that the presidential candidate considers the needs of women.
According to the report, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million. If women from all over Brazil are brought together to form a country, the country’s population will rank 13th in the world, more than twice the population of Spain.
In Brazil, the number of the women voters accounts for 52% of the total number of voters, and men account for 48%. Although the proportion of women among voters is very high, the proportion of women in the National Congress of Brazil is only 10%.
Among the 193 countries in the world, Brazilian women’s participation in politics ranks only 154th, higher than that of Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of power struggle, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in obtaining their reserved rights.
According to Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori, the existence of this phenomenon is because of the combined effects of ancient patriarchal society, racialism, and capitalism values.
"Politics should be civil rights, identity, access to public goods, and the formation of the same society by multiple social groups advocated by citizens. But the politics of Brazil belong to a monopoly of a certain group, and most of the population is not represented. "
A previous study by the Locomotiva also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that the politicians elected by the election can represent their rights, and 90% of Brazilian women disagree with the decisions made by politicians. 93% of women disagree with the current government policy.
"We need to reverse the problem of underrepresentation of women in National Congress, and Brazil’s political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there has been serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the political field in Brazil. " Natalia Mori said.
Although there is the lack of women’s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey shows that 76% of women believe they can make a difference in democratic elections, and 72% of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to expose women to less prejudice.

[Abstract] Upon completion, this vessel will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of China's State Oceanic Administration for use. Chen Zhi, the director of the Observation Division of Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of China's Ministry of Natural Resources, said it would be of great significance to develop China's offshore ocean observation system and promote global ocean observation after the vessel came into use.
On September 29, the first 3000-ton large-scale buoy vessel "Xiangyanghong 22" was launched in Wuchang Shipbuilding Industry Group Co.,Ltd.
Upon completion of this vessel, it will break the current equipment bottleneck of support work, such as the launching, retrieval and repair of large-scale buoys and subsurface buoys in China.
The "Xiangyanghong 22" vessel is mainly used for regular inspection and maintenance, regular launching and retrieval of buoys and subsurface buoys, emergency deployment, recovery and emergency launching, retrieval, repair and other support work of buoys and subsurface buoys. The vessel also has the ability to carry out comprehensive marine survey tasks such as cross-sectional survey.

ECNS, Qingdao, October 1 -- Affected by Typhoon Trami, the first race day of 2018 Qingdao "Mazarin" Cup powered by Extreme Sailing Series was postponed from September 30 to October 1, and the pre-game meeting was held before the race in Olympic Sailing Center in Qingdao. The captains of 12 hydrofoil catamaran teams from 6 countries and regions attended at the meeting.
Affected by Typhoon Trami, the strong winds constantly blew in the harbor basin and the maximum wind speed even reached 24 knots. The sailing signal was delayed by nearly 90 minutes from 1:00 pm on September 30. The wind speed was still not reduced, so the Race Director Anne Mallédant announced to cancel the race of the first day and postpone the race to the afternoon on October 1.
"The strong winds from the shore never seem to stop, and the state of the sea is so severe. "
Mallédant explained: "No one knows the time when the gust will blow to the racing boats as well as the scale of wind force.
Since the boat-sailing field is near the city, so far as it goes, the wisest choice is to cancel the race. "
The sailors still felt a little disappointed for everything was ready.
"The racing boats are ready, and we are in excellent condition. "
The helmsman of Qingdao Team Max Richardson said frankly: "But I know it is a right choice to change the race date. And I hope the wind will die down today, so that we can do some good. "
Micah Wilkinson, the "Hope Star" of New Zealand Team for 2020 Tokyo Olympiad, said: "Losing a day's time makes the race more interesting.
Because the race content will be increased today, and there will be only two days left for the race.
All of us will play hard. "
Though the sea wind blew violently, the helmsman of French ABM Team Pierre-Yves Durand told his warm memories with Qingdao at the pre-game meeting that he was accidentally injured in the Extreme Sailing Series 5 years ago, resulting in the muscular rupture, and fortunately, the local race medical team helped him deal with it so that he could stand here to take part in the race after 5 years.
It was learned that the Extreme Sailing Series started from 2007, and it was an ISAF game equivalent to the Volvo Ocean Race, the America's Cup and the World Match Racing Tour.
The hydrofoil catamaran of "FlyingPhantom" would be used in this race in Qingdao.
It is the 8th year of having this race in Qingdao, the "City of Sails". And it is the last race of this Series.
Although the turbulence in global financial markets continued, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of the Exchange Fund in the third quarter of this year fell by 97% annually, and it was better than that in the previous quarter, since overseas stocks rose and foreign exchange losses obviously narrowed under the China-U.S. trade war.
According to the latest data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$1.6 billion from July to September 2018, significantly lower than HK$61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on the legislative session that at the beginning of the China-U.S. trade war, the share index in Hong Kong and emerging markets ran counter to the U.S. share index. By the end of September and early October, after the U.S. share index peaked in succession, the market sentiment began to reverse, since investors gradually realized that the trade war was also detrimental to the U.S. itself.
"It is good to have changes in the market sentiment. If the trade war only has unilateral effects, it doesn't help much for solving problems. "
He also pointed out that "if the trade war cannot be solved, the fluctuation of financial markets will continue to rise. "
In the third quarter of this year, the stock investment losses of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK$4.7 billion compared with the previous quarter, and the investment income of overseas stock increased by 17.2% to HK$12.8 billion; the foreign exchange losses was HK$16.2 billion and the bond yields was HK$9.7 billion, with a decrease of 24% and 31% respectively, mainly reflecting the general rise of the US dollar for exchange of major currencies in this quarter and the rise of the US coupon rate to above 3% in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund was mainly used for supporting Hong Kong dollars.
Hong Kong has implemented the linked exchange rate system for the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar since 1983.
As for the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the uncertainty of the economic and asset markets increased and downside risks increased, but the financial system Hong Kong was robust, so that good defence were made and the earthquake-resistant capacity was abundant.
"The international investment position is abundant in Hong Kong, with a net external asset value of US$1.4 trillion, which is 4 times GDP, higher than 2.5 times in Singapore and 0.6 times in Japan. It is enough to cope with the financial downturns or reversal. "
The current daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall and the interest margin with US dollars expanded. Chen Delin pointed out that the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar rose more than 400 basis points on September 21. The markets generally believed that it was mainly related to the rise of the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars. And then the Hong Kong dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84 for exchange of the US dollar. Until recently, the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall, and the interest margin with US dollars expanded, which might attract more hedging activities to sell the Hong Kong dollar and buy the US dollar, triggering the opportunity of the exchange guarantee of the weak side again to increase compared with that of the previous period.
However, he believed that as the interest-rate rise cycle of the Hong Kong Bank began and the Hong Kong dollar interest rates were normalizing, the situation that Hong Kong dollar interest rates were lower than US dollar interest rates would change in the future.
"The trend of Hong Kong dollar interest rates and US dollar interest rates will be more consistent. Everyone must be more careful to manage risks and prepared to cope with market fluctuations. "
Since the funds of the Hong Kong dollar was abundant, the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars fell further. The three-month daily interest rates on private loan fell by 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, and the interest rate differential with the US dollar increased from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the one-month daily interest rates on private loan hit the bottom within five months, and the interest rate differential with the US dollar increased from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the spot rate of Hong Kong dollars was close to 7.85 with exchange of $1 most of the time.
During that time, due to factors of partial share offer gained outflows from Hong Kong dollars after the completion of interest arbitrage activities and large-scale share offer activities, causing that the exchange guarantee for the weak side was triggered for the first time in April, and for many times in May and August.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought Hong Kong dollars and sold Hong Kong dollars at the level of 7.85 according to the linked exchange rate system, in order to maintain the stability of the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought around HK$52.1 billion under the mechanism of exchange guarantee of the weak side from May to August.
Does foreigners can benefit from the new Individual Income Tax Law?
On 30th, the relevant person in charge from Ministry of Finance and State Administration of Taxation answered the reporters that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
Some reporters asked that the newly revised Individual Income Tax Law will adjust the criterion for resident taxpayers of China’s Individual Income Tax Law from one year to 183 days.
"May I ask if there are any preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, in implementing this new law?"
The principals responded that the current effective Individual Income Tax Law’s enforcement regulations have special preferential provisions for taxation issues for foreigners. For individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived for more than one year and less than five years and earn incomes from outside China, their part of the payment by domestic units or individuals is subject to individual income tax.
The principals said that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
The confinement center without "threshold": quality certification would promote the quality.
As the "two-child economic" develops and the maternal and child market thrives, various grades of confinement service centers appeared around China, from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to the 3rd and 4th tier cities.
The popular confinement service centers, which could satisfy the consumer's demands, charged from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan. However, they were in an awkward situation, because this kind of institution had no threshold at all, and there was still the There is still a blank zone in regulation.
Recently, the State Administration for Market Regulation carried out a series of activities of 2018 National "Quality Month". The reporter came to a five-star confinement center in Tianjin to explore the certification of maternal and child care services.
A common confinement center provided the services of newborn care, nutritious food, and postpartum reconstruction, etc.
The reporter found in this confinement center that the nurses would check the newborn breastfeeding each day, and the professional nursing workers would provide the newborns with the careful nursing services, such as bathing and touching.
In order to satisfy the new mother's demand, it would provide the wound care in the beginning of confinement, bodybuilding care in the middle and later periods of confinement, Chinese traditional cosmetic treatment and other nursing items to help the new mother restore her graceful figure.
A new mother there told the reporter that she had booked this confinement service center 8 months in advance.
The service items of confinement service center would directly impact the parturient's comfort and body recovery during the confinement. Some small confinement service centers could only provide some simple services during the confinement, but there were many problems and hidden troubles, including the irregular sterilization and sanitation, incidental cross infection, limited and unscientific diet, etc.
The responsible person of this confinement center said that they were the only one five-star confinement center in Tianjin, which had been certified as a Grade B service provider.
"Some customers didn't understand the meaning of the Grade B certification at first, but the fact forcing the enterprises to strictly implement the standardized process management through certification will benefit the customers. It is important for the long-term development of enterprises. " he said.
Pan Lifen, the deputy director of the Attestation Supervision Department of the State Administration for Market Regulation, said that the service certification was a new kind of certification system, which was based on the customers' perception and focused on the organizational quality management and satisfaction of service characteristics. It was an important part of the national quality infrastructure, and had a positive effects on increasing the proportion of quality services and enhancing China's international service competitiveness.
After more than 10 years of development since 2004, the service certification project in our country had gone through a process of developing from scratch. A series of influential service certification had appeared, including the financial service certification, mother and baby nursing service certification, after-sales service certification, electronic commerce service certification, and health care service certification.
According to the statistics of the State Administration for Market Regulation, there are more than 130 service certification institutions with over 2000 service certification staff and nearly 8000 valid authentication certificates at present in our country.
Pan Lifen said that it was necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually extend the coverage of service certification in the fields of health, education, sports, finance and electronic commerce, and boost the supply-side reform and quality enhancement in the service industry.
Report of Reuters on November 5 in Hong Kong: the property price in Hong Kong fell for two consecutive months after peaking. Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on Monday that it needed time to observe whether the property market had entered downturns. If confirmed, it can be considered to successively ease the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures at an appropriate time.
Chen Delin also pointed out that if the property price fell, the first to be affected would be those who bought properties at the peak of the property market, but it was expected that there would be less opportunities to occur the situation like sharply falling property prices and the properties substantially sold by the citizens during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997.
When leading multiple senior leaders of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to attend the briefing session of the legislative session, Chen Delin said that if the property market was determined to enter downturns, the ease of measures can be made in succession at an appropriate time.
"However, since data of a few weeks only can currently be seen, it's still too early to ease, and it needs more time to see whether the property market is entering downturns. "
Since October 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has successively launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to substantially tighten the mortgages of various properties, including reduction of the number of mortgages, and that the mortgage applicants have to pass rigorous stress tests, in order to improve the bank risk management and shock resistance.
As Hong Kong formally entered the interest-rate rise cycle, the house price index of private houses in Hong Kong peaked for two consecutive months in August and September and then fell, and the monthly decline in September even expanded to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year was still 10.2%.
According to the data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the household financial conditions for the ability of Hong Kong to withstand financial risks were measured to be healthy. In the second quarter this year, the percentage of households of self-occupation non-mortgage residence in Hong Kong was 66%, which was higher than the average of 60% in 2009-2011; the average loan-to-value ratio of the newly approved mortgage and the percentage of contribution and income of the newly approved mortgage was 47% and 34% respectively, with obvious improvement compared with 64% and 41% in 2009-2011.
However, Chen Delin said that high shock resistance didn’t mean the citizens who had bought properties wouldn’t be suffered damage of financial downturns, since the property valuation would fall, and those who bought properties at peak times would be the first to be affected.
Although the Hong Kong Monetary Authority tightened the lending of the bank to the mortgage borrowers, those who bought properties can also get a high-percentage mortgage loan by means of the mortgage insurance, the mortgage loan provided by the developer and so on.
Chen Delin said that currently together with the mortgage loan provided by the developer, the mortgage percentage of the borrower can reach 85-90%. If the property price fell by 10%, there would be negative assets (i.e. the market value of the property fell below the level of the total outstanding mortgage loan).
However, Ruan Guoheng, the vice president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority pointed out that the Authority estimated the total high-percentage mortgage loan provided by the developer to account for 2-2.5% of the total mortgage of the bank, with lower proportion.
At the peak time of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, with proportion of 22% in those who took mortgage.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative asset for seven consecutive quarters.

ECNS, Shenzhen, October 1 (reported by Zheng Xiaohong, Xu Dianwei & Liu Shumeng) -- It was the first day of the National Day "Golden Week" in the mainland on October 1. And it was also the last day of the National Day public holiday in Hong Kong. Many mainland residents used this holiday to travel and go shopping across the border, while many Hong Kong residents returned to Hong Kong after visiting Shenzhen. The passenger volume of Shenzhen ports was "full to bursting", and the ports in Luohu and Shenzhen Bay had newly opened 22 automated gateways. This would improve the clearance efficiency in ports and facilitate the passengers to be cleared by the customs effectively and rapidly.
According to the data provided by Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection, over 4290000 people and over 168000 vehicles had been transported across the boarder by 16:00 that afternoon. The ports had always been busy and orderly with a good order of entry and exit.
It was learned that there were an increasing number of passengers taking advantage of the National Day holiday to visit the countries in Europe and Southeast Asia to go shopping affected by many positive factors, such as there were more countries providing the visa-free policy for the Chinese citizens.
The passenger (car) flow peak in the exit direction in the ports in Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huanggang, and Futian occurred in the morning of October 1. The passenger flow peak in Luohu port lasted from 9:00 am to 11:00 am, and the passenger (car) flow peak in Shenzhen Bay port lasted from 6:30 am to the noon at 13:00.
According to the introduction, in order to cope with passenger (car) flow peak across the boarder, Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection followed the unified deployment of the State Immigration Administration to start the service mode of passenger (car) flow peak period, arrange the policemen to work overtime to support those working in the front-line on duty, open enough passages for inspection and examination in advance, ensure that the queueing time of Chinese citizen's exit and entry would not exceed 30 minutes while taking into account of the foreigner's clearance efficiency; the order maintenance in the crowded was enhanced, and the customs clearance was ensured to be safe and orderly.
Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection also reminded the travelers across the boarder to pay attention to the expiry dates of their certificates, visas, and endorsements before their trips, make the travel arrangement in a reasonable way, try to avoid the passenger flow peak period and choose a right time and a right port to travel.
The passengers headed for Hong Kong via Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link must take their valid exit & entry documents, visas and endorsements. The high-speed rail ticket could be used as a proof of payment only, but not the exit and entry certificate. Anyone, who couldn't go to Hong Kong across the boarder due to the reasons such as the documents and procedures were not satisfiable, should follow the guide of the policeman on duty in the Frontier Inspection, and go to the designated site to wait for the staff of MTR corporation to guide them to go through the procedures of returning the mainland by train.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and stubborn disease involving multiple organs of the body. It used to be considered as an "incurable disease".
Because its pathogenesis is unknown, diagnosis and treatment are difficult, and there is lack of effective treatment, it is hard to cure once and for all.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatism and Immunity Center at Peking University People’s Hospital, together with their teams discovered the existence of human immune globulin can increase the molecular variation of systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility, and this kind of variation is involved in the regulation of immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors and member of Peking University People’s Hospital, the team of Li Zhanguo collected nearly 2,000 large samples of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus to make study. It was found that patients with immune globulin variations produced pathopoiesis cells and a wide variety of numerous autoantibodies. The incidence and severity of nephritis, arthritis, orrhomeningitis vasculitis and other inflammations are significantly increased.
Through various research methods such as immune cell tracing, animal testing, and sequencing, Liu Wanli team found that the immune molecule variation activates the immune signaling pathway and the pathogenic mechanism of promoting B cells secreting various autoantibodies.
The reporter learned that the powerful combination between two teams gave full play to their respective advantages and achieved a close integration between basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli team is committed to B lymphocyte immune recognition and immune activation research, and the Li Zhanguo team has long been engaged in clinical research on systemic lupus erythematosus.
"This research is one of the results of years of cooperation between the two teams. It is also the first time in the academic community to recognize that immune globulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, which lays a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapy. "
This is not shield mistakes, but acting by law.
Lawyers took an axe to the court?
The news was really exciting at first glance, and it also caused a great disturbance in the legal circle.
Fujian Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court subsequently fined the lawyers for 500 yuan and proposed in writing to the Quanzhou Lawyers Association to investigate and handle.
According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association issued a formal notice that the behaviors of the two lawyers did not involve violations of laws and regulations and were not punished according to law.
According to the multi-party reports, the handling of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is not a shortcomings protection or confrontation, but has been approved by the Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court.
An event that could have caused tension within the legal community was eventually resolved properly.
The reversal of the event stems from the more completed truth restoring: the axe carried by the lawyer involved is the same type and same model as the defendant’s weapon, but it is not put the first edge. It only serves as secondary evidence in the evidence-proven and cross-examination link, and there is no threatening acts or the subject intention of "endangering the court security".
Judging whether the behaviors of the lawyers involved is illegal or not, there are four very important details to be concerned. First, the local court has twice held the court and only showed a photo of the axe. From the perspective of defense, it is necessary to show the original axe. Second, the axe is purchased one hour before the court open. It is not that the lawyer is not willing to seek the judge’s consent, but it is not able to contact the judge objectively. Third, the axe has not been used in an excessive or improper manner. Fourth, the lawyers admitted the mistake in public and immediately apologized to the court.
Based on these plots, it can be seen that the lawyers who "took axe to appear in court" have nothing to do the devil things, but just to make defense.
After clarifying the whole facts, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association did not follow the societal discussion, but resisted the pressure and made a decision not to impose penalties.
And this decision can withstand the test of facts and laws.
As taking the axe as the controlled knife to the court without the permission of the court, it is easy to cause anxiety and misunderstanding.
For the sake of safety and cautious, Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court’s previous fine punishment and judicial advice are also understandable.
In order to maintain the dignity of lawyers and prevent several courts from finding excuses to purposely make difficulties for lawyers, the Supreme Law promulgated the "Rules on Security Checks by Judicial Policemen of the People’s Courts" in 2014, establishing the principles that lawyers do not need to conduct personal security check in court.
Since the issuance of the Rule, lawyers have set examples, and there have been few incidents endangering the court security happened due to the omissions of security checks.
In such a very rare case happened in Quanzhou, as long as we communicate in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, misunderstanding is not difficult to eliminate.
As a self-regulatory organization in the lawyer profession, the Lawyers Association bears the dual mission of disciplining against law and safeguard the legitimate rights.
In the past, individual Lawyers Association organizations have been blamed for their emphasis on disciplinary action and their loss of safeguard.
The decision of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is worthy of praise both in terms of process and results, and it sets an example for more lawyers association to perform their duties correctly.
Which tax benefits will affect our money bag from October 1?
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1 (reported by Sang Tong) -- The New Individual Income Tax Law will be implemented from January 1, 2019. In order to have the broad masses of the people enjoy the benefits of tax reduction as soon as possible, the tax will firstly be deducted from taxpayers' actual job salaries based on the minimum threshold of 5000 yuan per month from October 1, 2019, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied.
With the implementation of new policy, which benefits will really affect the people's money bag?
The first benefit: the income tax will be reduced significantly in the job salaries.
The taxpayer receiving the job salaries after October 1 can have the basic deduction of fees deducted based on the threshold of 5000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied. Most of the taxpayers will enjoy different levels of tax reduction, especially the lower and middle-income people, who will see more significant tax reduction.
According to the tax reduction fact sheet of different income groups, for the people whose monthly income will be 8000 yuan, 10000 yuan, 20000 yuan, and 50000 yuan after deducting the "three insurances and one fund", the taxable amounts after the tax reform will be 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, and 9090 yuan respectively. Compared with the monthly threshold of 3500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, 18.8% respectively.
It is worth noting that due to holidays, the new basic deduction of fees and tax rate schedule can be applied to the salaries that should be paid by the units in October but have been paid at the end of September according to laws.
For this purpose, the withholding client software, which is uniformly promoted and used by the tax department, has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid during the statutory declaration period.
The second benefit: the gaps between grades of low tax rates will be obviously widened.
In addition to raising the threshold, the new tax rate schedule will be applied from October 1.
This time, seven grades of tax rates of job salaries are the same as before without any changes, but the gaps between grades of tax rates are obviously changed. The gaps between three grades of low tax rates in 3%, 10% and 20% are obviously widened, the gap of the grade of tax rate in 25% is slightly narrowed, but the gaps between three grades of high tax rates in 30%, 35% and 45% are the same as before.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the grades of tax rates for income from production and business operation, and the lower limit of the highest grade of tax rate in 35% has been increased from 0.1 million yuan to 0.5 million yuan.
This means that the individual businesses and personal exclusive investment enterprises will benefit from this tax reform.
"From the perspective of measurement and calculation of personal tax reduction for Shanghai taxpayers in the earlier stage, the broad masses of taxpayers will fully experience the benefits of the personal income tax reform, especially the lower and middle-income people, who will see more significant tax reduction. "
Lan Min, the head of Personal Income Tax Division of Shanghai Tax Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation, said.
The third benefit: the tax service will become more convenient and optimized.
Shanghai tax departments have carried out a series of comprehensive activities of tax propaganda since the announcement of the new personal income tax law.
On the one hand, they provided the policy guidance on "one-to-one & point-to-point" for the important tax sources and important enterprises.
Pudong New Area Tax Bureau has visited Apple Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Alipay (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd., Red Star Macalline Group Corporation Ltd. and other large enterprises successively. These enterprises have a large number of employees and a large amount of works in withholding and remitting tax, so the tax department actively provided coaching and answered questions; Xuhui District Tax Bureau has visited some large labor service enterprises, including CIIC Financial Consulting Ltd. and CIIC Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Ltd. within the district. It collected their concerned problems, responded to their appeals, and resolved their difficulties in a timely way.
On the other hand, they implemented the "comprehensive, multidimensional and stereoscopic" tax policy promotion for the citizen taxpayers.
They used Shanhai Tax official website, WeChat official account, MicroBlog and other resources to post the hot topics and ensured that the policy announcements were in place.
At the same time, Shanghai Tax WeChat official account has put the 12366 Intelligent Consulting Platform since September 28. It would carry out the "targeted" integrated intelligent services of personal income tax reform via the "Human+Intelligence" tax service consultation.

The result of the Election of Okinawa Governor, which was conducted ahead of schedule because the former governor Onaga Takeshi had died of illness, was announced on October 1 local time. Denny Tamaki, who opposed the plan of relocating the US military base in Japan, was elected successfully.
This election was voted on September 30. The final result showed that Tamaki had 396632 votes, which was the most votes made in the history of the Election of Okinawa Governor. He had over 80000 more votes than his major opponent Atsushi Sakima.
A total of 4 candidates participated in this election, and the voting rate was 63.24%, which was 0.89% lower than that of the Election of Okinawa Governor in 2014.
Tamaki told the media on October 1 that the result of election showed that the Okinawa people didn't want to waste the former governor Onaga Takeshi's efforts during his lifetime, and he would carry out Takeshi's behests to make continued efforts in opposing the plan of relocating the US military base and the closure of the Futenma base to the Japanese government and the American government.
The Futenma base is located in Ginowan in Okinawa Prefecture, and it has been criticized all the time. The Japanese government and the American government have agreed to relocate it to Henoko in Nago, but the Okinawa people strongly oppose this action and hope to move the base completely out of Okinawa.
For the relocation plan strongly opposed by Okinawa people and the request to cancel the permit for land reclamation along the coast of Henoko, Tamaki said that he didn't stand on the opposite and divisive ground against the central government at the beginning. He hoped that both sides could fully exchange views, show the intention to solve the problems through negotiation.
Japanese President Shinzo Abe also told the media in the morning of October 1 that he would seriously accept this result and make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden on the base.
Yoshihide Suga, the Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan, said in the press conference on October 1 that the government's policy of relocating the US base as soon as possible had not been changed at all.
And he also expressed his intention to talk with Tamaki.
Tamaki will officially take up his duties as the governor of Okinawa.
Since the mid-2000s, with China’s increasing needs for oilseeds, Paul Thomas, a farmer in North Dakota, has grown more and more soybeans in his field.
This transition reaches the peak this year. He has grown 1,600 acres of soybeans in the 5,000-acre land, reaching an unprecedented scale
However, in 2019, Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch production to the staple crops in the former U.S. agricultural region, such as corn and wheat.
The area of soybeans grown by American farmers exceeds that of corn this year, which is for the first time in 35 years.
The reason why the farmers plan to switch production to other crops is that American farmers face difficulties in selling soybeans in the context of the trade war launched by President Trump against China.
China usually purchases around 60% of soybeans exported from America, but because of the trade war, the purchases of American soybeans are nearly zero in recent months, leading to a 10-year low in soybean prices.
Thomas plans to grow more wheats next year and hopes to earn more by reducing dependence on crops that rely on Chinese demands.
Thomas said that the soybean price "brings us a heavy blow".
He said that the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per bushel without Chinese demands, while the price needed for covering costs was $8.50.
The area of soybeans grown by American farmers hits a high record and the harvest is expected to hit a high record.
At such a vulnerable time, they are hit by the trade war.
As Trump imposed tariffs on the goods imported from China, China imposes tariffs on the soybeans imported from America in July.
The United States Department of Agriculture will release the first estimated report of cultivated area next year, which is expected to include consideration of tariff effects.
This estimate is expected to confirm the expectations of non-governmental organizations that the cultivated area of soybeans will be reduced.
According to a report seen by Reuters, on October 19, Informa Economics predicted that the cultivated area of corns would increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) and the cultivated area of soybeans would decrease by 7% to 83 million acres in 2019.
Informa also predicted that the cultivated area of wheats in America would increase by 4%.
The cultivated area of soybeans increases to 89.6 million acres this year before retaliatory tariffs are implemented, which is about 15 million acres higher than that of 10 years ago.
The cultivated area of corns has increased by less than 5 million acres to 89.1 million acres since 2008. The cultivated area of wheats is 47.8 million acres this year, which is close to the lowest level in 100 years.
The total cultivated area of the president of Illinois Corn Growers Association Aron Carlson’s family is 3,600 acres. He uses nearly half of the land to grow soybeans, but he plans to make reduction in the future.
He said that the cultivated area of corns in the farm in North Illinois would increase by 20% at most; this state is the largest soybean cultivation state in America.
The yields per acre of soybeans are lower than that of corns, but less fertilizer is needed, which makes the cost of soybean cultivation relatively low as a whole.
If farmers switch production to corns, the cost may increase. But the fertilizer seller of Andersons Inc and other enterprises may benefit from it.
Pat Bowe, the CEO of Andersons said to Reuters that he predicted that switching production to corns would be beneficial to fertilizer use.
Bayer also predicts to benefit from farmers switching production to corns.

Facing the new situations and new challenges, China has issued a loud voice on the development direction and path of multilateralism.
As Wang Yi, State Councilor and Foreign Minister, stated at the General Debate of the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly that multilateralism in the new era should pursue the goal of win-win cooperation, act upon rules and order, uphold fairness and justice, and act to deliver real results.
At the same time, China calls for the establishment of a global development cooperation of making the United Nations as the core, North-South cooperation as the main channel and South-South cooperation as the complement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community with shared future for mankind.
China’s thought and voice reflect the mainstream of the international community.
As the President of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly Espinosa said, under the current situation, "the United Nations needs to develop and expand multilateralism and maintain a rules-based international system more than ever".
Lagarde, President of International Monetary Fund, said that the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules, and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, as the changes of global economy and political power balance, some newly-developing markets and developing countries have emerged in groups, playing a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, and providing new development impetus for the multilateralism that has suffered from the headwinds.
Thinking in this dimension,building a big family but not making up small circles, adhering to discussion and collaboration but not winner-take-all and other the multilateralism ideas advocated by China follow the trend of the times, they are the inevitable choices to cope with global challenges and solve world problems, representing the common pursuit of the majority countries around the world.
Advanced idea with more solid action.
China’s "One Belt One Road" has become the largest international cooperation platform.
"One Belt One Road", Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, "16+1 Cooperation" and other international and regional cooperation initiatives launched by China promote international cooperation, improve existing international systems and order, and bring innovation vitality to multilateral cooperation and make contribution to the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction.
As the defender of the international order and the practitioner of multilateralism, China’s actions are becoming more and more powerful in the multilateral stage of the United Nations.
Mediate heated-discussion international points, address climate changes, participate in peacekeeping operations, vigorously reduce poverty and help the poor, and help other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As United Nations Secretary-General, Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the "trust deficit" faced by the world intensifies, when Populism and polarization trends are on the rise, it is the most urgent moment that the world needs multilateral cooperation.
At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to join hands to turn consensus into actions, resolutely defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the building of community with shared future for mankind.

The fifth "Month of vocalization for the disabled" comes; focus on the issue of sex education for disabled teenagers - China News
In recent years, the topic of sex education for Chinese teenagers has been widely discussed, but the challenge for sex education for disabled teenagers is still arduous.
Recently, the seminar on challenges and practical strategies of comprehensive sex education for the disabled was held in Beijing.
It is an major issue about how to carry out sex education for disabled children and young people in this seminar.
"The report of sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of Chinese disabled children and young people" released at the meeting reveals that the proportion of disabled children subjected to sexual harassment and abuse is higher than that of healthy children.
For disabled children and teenagers, what the society focuses on is the attention of "sexual protection".
This seminar aims at promoting the comprehensive sex education for disabled children and teenagers in China from three aspects of family support, school education and institution services, providing support to the disabled children and teenagers from the source, thus letting them enjoy the right of love as others do.
Experts believe that the Chinese public understanding of disabled groups has remained at a level that is not deep enough for a long time.
Being influenced by the traditional concept and other factors, the comprehensive sex education for the disabled, especially for the disabled children and teenagers in China, is not deep enough.
However, in recent years, with the support of the UNESCO and public-spirited people, the practice and implementation path of full-cycle comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education for the disabled in China have made gratifying progress.
"The report" shows that the children and young people with visual impairment, hearing impairment, intellectual impairment and physical impairment have more difficulties in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding intimate relationship than the ordinary people, but they have generally developed towards convenience and enrichment.
"The seminar on challenges and practical strategies of comprehensive sex education for the disabled" is held by the Shanghai Youren Public Welfare Foundation and supported by the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the Beijing Representative Office of the International League for Disabled Persons (France) and the UNFPA Representative Office in China. Its purpose is to explore the practice and implementation path of full-cycle comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education for the disabled in the context of grand strategy of healthy China, and promote the interested parties of policy makers, educators, researchers, social service organizations and parents’ representatives in the field of special education and integrated education to understand the international policy on comprehensive sexual education and the right to health of disabled children and young people; the practices, strategies, challenges and resources of sex education for disabled children and young people in China are widely exchanged, and the way of comprehensive sex education for disabled children and young people in the future is discussed and a blueprint is set up to form a support network.
Report of the Reuters on September 30 in Beijing - People's Bank Of China released its predetermined short-term net outflow of foreign currency assets on Sunday and showed as of the end of August this year, its short positions in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies remained zero for 12 consecutive months, and there were still no long position in that month.
Previous data from the People's Bank Of China showed that as of the end of August last year, the it had a total short position of $6.044 billion in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the short position in SDR (Special Drawing Rights) was 4.276 billion SDR.
Since then, the foreign exchange forwards short position of the People's Bank Of China remained zero.
People's Bank Of China released the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; the data showed that at the end of February 2016, its long positions in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies was US$2.438 billion and short positions was US$28.9 billion.
The data in September released at the end of October of the same year showed a net short position increase of $16.401 billion to $45.301 billion for the first time.
People's Bank Of China has previously said that the forward and futures short positions of foreign currencies vs local currencies mainly reflected the forward operations of foreign exchange carried out by the People's Bank Of China with commercial banks with the purpose of meeting the hedging needs of enterprises' foreign currency liabilities. It would continue to provide forward hedging products according to the principle of actual demand, and the forward operations of the People's Bank Of China would have minor impact on the scale of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, student Qiao, who was a junior in Zhengzhou, took the train to Hebi.
An elder uncle on the train bought a ticket without seat, but he took up her seat, and said: "you can take photos, whatever".
During the two hours of driving, the train conductor advised him for an hour, however it still had no results.
In the end, a male passenger in the same carriage could not stand up and pulled up the elder uncle.
From the public opinion, although the final result is mostly that the persons who forcibly occupy seats are condemned by the public, administratively punished by the public security department, and even included in the blacklist of integrity, the public still feels that it does not "vent their hates": Why can’t the persons who forcibly occupy seats be punished on the spot?
Why can’t stop immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, but can only punish it afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behavior of "the elder uncle who forcibly occupy seats", why only a male passenger pull him up because of "Road see injustice"?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with railway policemen, and there is generally no railway policemen for short-distance trains; even if there is railway policemen, the passengers are more concerned about the possible rogue reactions of the persons who forcibly occupy seats and do not take compulsory taking away measures.
Repeated seats forcibly occupied events have made people realize that it is necessary to let the persons who forcibly occupy seats be forced to take away or even be punished on the spot.
This requires that our railway policemen should dare to take powerful measures in a timely manner. Trains that do not have policemen should make deployment as soon as possible to preserve and prevent illegal activities in a timely manner.
It is the first day of the National Day holiday in October 1. There is a surge in the vehicles heading for Mao County and Songpan County via Beichuan Qiang Minority Autonomous County in Sichuan.
Beichuan Traffic Police received a call for help at about 13:00 saying that a family member had a traffic accident in Songpan and was badly in need of being sent to Mianyang for treatment due to the limited local medical conditions.
However, the Huanhu Road of Tangjiashan quake lake in Beichuan was under one-way traffic control, so the caller hoped the traffic police would permit the 120 emergency ambulance to pass though the road.
After getting the call for help, the policeman on duty quickly reported this to the traffic police group. After understanding the general situation, the group leader Huang Xuemin immediately arranged the policemen on duty at the controlled site to contact with the help seeker and asked them to do the escort job well.
"There were more than 1000 vehicles having entered the controlled road segment at that time. After contacting with the 120 emergency ambulance, we estimated that it would arrive at Beichuan at about 15:00, so we implemented the arrangement and deployment immediately. "
The leader of Yuli Squadron of Beichuan Traffic Police Da Wei introduced that the emergency ambulance needed to bypass the Huanhu Road of Tangjiashan quake lake, and the road was steep and narrow. In order to prevent the vehicles in the road segment from running side by side, the traffic police implemented the subsection control of vehicles in the beginning, the middle and the end of the road an hour in advance and reminded all drivers passing through it to make a way for the emergency ambulance.
Later, the policemen of Leigu Squadron also stopped the vehicles entering the controlled road segment temporarily, and asked the vehicles to form a line to make a way for the incoming 120 emergency ambulance.
An emergency ambulance with a "Chuan U" license plate was driving into Beichuan at about 15:00, and Beichuan Traffic Police sent a police car to clear the way and escort the emergency ambulance into the controlled road segment by driving against the traffic.
It was learned that some places on Huanhu Road only permitted one vehicle passing through, and the police implemented the temporary control at these places so that the 120 emergency ambulance could successfully pass through.
It was impossible to give way in a road segment in Shilibei Village in Daxuanping Town, so the traffic police got in touch with the village party branch and village committee in advance to use the village road for bypassing and stop the social vehicles from entering.
"It only took 40 minutes from Beichuan Traffic Police met the 120 emergency ambulance to drive into the normal road of the 302 provincial highway. "
Da Wei explained that the overall passing time needed to be 4 hours under normal circumstances.
"This arrangement has successfully saved precious treatment time for the patient. "
It was learned that the critically ill patient was timely sent to Mianyang for treatment at 17:20.

This is the first pickpocket case cracked by Beijing police during the National Day holiday.
The anti-pickpocket investigators of Beijing Police Mobile Investigation Corps arrived at the designated position at about 5:00 yesterday morning.
According to the previous experience, the places with massive human traffic, including the public transit hubs, bus and subway lines, and even the crowd watching the flag-raising ceremony in Tiananmen Square, are the key areas in their work.
In the crowd, the plainclothes policemen were calmly observing the people passing by.
The investigators, who were waiting at the bus station, found two suspicious man following a man to get on No. 20 bus from Yongding Gate Station at about 7:00.
On the bus, the two men standing on the left and right of the male passenger, and one of them tried to provide cover for the other.
But they didn't know that the plainclothes policemen standing by were paying close attention to their every movement.
"Catch the thief with the stolen goods". It was very critical for the plainclothes policemen to choose the timing of catching the thief. While waiting for the men to steal, the policemen had to keep their eyes on them, who were preparing for the pickpocket. As soon as they succeeded in pickpocket, the investigators caught them at one stroke.
The reporter of Beijing Morning Post learned that the policemen ferreted out 800 yuan cash from the suspected pickpockets.
"They took the money from the passenger's coat pocket. "
The policeman pointed to a broken coat pocket and said: "They cut it here, and stole 800 yuan cash from a Beijing tourist. When we caught them, they had just put the money into their pocket. "
The reporter learned that the plainclothes policemen had followed the suspected pickpockets for an hour in order to catch them. Finally, they caught them at one stroke when they were committing a crime.
Currently, the two criminal suspects were under the police's examination.
The plainclothes policeman told the reporter that it was easy for the policeman to recognize the suspects in the crowd.
"You will find out that the thieves' eyes and expressions were different from the ordinary passengers' when you have caught a number of thieves. In addition to staring at other people's pockets and backpacks, they also like to get into the crowd instead of avoiding the crowd. "
The policeman also told the reporter that the suspects were often purposeless while waiting for the bus. They liked to wander at the bus station and would follow the target to get on a bus.
"These are the voices of experience. If you have worked as a plainclothes policeman for a long time enough, you will know it quite sensibly. "
Furthermore, the policeman also reminded: "It is the most convenient to put things in the coat pocket, but it will be the easiest to be stolen. "
Mind your own property when you are traveling outside and taking a bus to avoid being stolen.

Report from our correspondent (intern reporter, Li Qiyao): In recent years, the events of unqualified campus plastic runway have occurred in many regions.
Therefore, the Ministry of Education issues a notice that requires the sport fields with surfaces made of synthetic materials for primary and secondary schools to implement the new national standard before delivery for use after November 1.
The mandatory national standard "The sport fields with surfaces made of synthetic materials for primary and secondary schools" is led by the Ministry of Education. 26 research institutes and testing organizations have participated in drafting the standard and it have gone through more than two years of revision. During that time, more than 100 meetings of expert argument were held, and the nationwide field studies and sampling inspections were implemented. Countless validation experiments have been collected from products of hundreds of enterprises on the market.
The reporter contrasts the old national standard in 2005 and finds that the new national standard has not only changed from the "national recommended standard" to the "national mandatory standard", but also added a lot of content, including thickness requirements, physical properties, aging resistance, requirements for inorganic filler content, requirements for anti-slip colloidal particle polymer content, limits of harmful substances of surface finished products, limits of harmful substances of non-solid and solid materials, etc.
In particular, the new national standard limits the harmful substances that may be produced in the construction process of campus plastic runway, increasing from 7 to 18 items, and stipulates the limits of volatile organic compounds in the built runway according to the standard of home decoration.
For example, the release amount of harmful substances is specified in the "Limits of cast-in-situ and prefabricated surface finished products and odor requirements", which requires that the total volatile organic compounds should not exceed 5 mg/cubic meter, formaldehyde should not exceed 0.4 mg/cubic meter, carbon disulfide should not exceed 7 mg/cubic meter, benzene should not exceed 0.1 mg/cubic meter, and the odor grade should not be higher than Grade 3.
The new national standard also stipulates in detail the sampling requirements, inspection rules and judgment rules of plastic runways of primary and secondary schools.
In addition, the campus artificial lawn has also been included in the mandatory testing scope of the national standard for the first time.
In the near future, special work plans will be carried out for the implementation situation of the new national standard all over the country, and the implementation of the new national standard should be submitted to the Department of Sports Hygiene and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education within the year.
ECNS Client, Chengdu, September 30 (reported by Wang Yu) -- There was an "internal battle within the Chinese table tennis team" at the 2018 ITTF Women's World Cup finals in the afternoon on September 30.
Ding Ning, the Grand Slam winner, finally secured an impressive 4-0 victory over her teammate Zhu Yuling, who was the host, and won the golden medal again in the ITTF Women's World Cup after four years. This was also the 21st time for the Chinese table tennis team to win the championship in the ITTF Women's World Cup.
Ding Ning and Zhu Yuling are teammates and friends, so they are very familiar with each other's technique and tactics.
Regardless of preparing for the game or warming up before the game, they are very closely associated with each other.
After entering the finals, both of them invariably expressed that they had fulfilled their competition duties.
However, the contest between Ding Ning and Zhu Yuling can be called as a hot battle.
In the first set, due to her rich experience of competition, Ding Ning started in the ascendant and was 3-0 ahead. Then, Zhu Yuling took advantage of the mistakes made by Ding Ning and tied it at 3.
Subsequently, Zhu Yuling made increasing mistakes in attack, while Ding Ning seized this opportunity to get 3 points in a row with a 9-5 lead, and was the first to get the game point at 10-6.
Although Zhu Yuling got 3 points straightly, Ding Ning took the opportunity of serving to win 11-9 in the first set.
In the second set, Zhu Yuling still made a lot of mistakes, while Ding Ning made good use of the advantage of being locked in a stalemate and held a safe lead at 6-1.

When talking about whether the enthusiastic home crowd would pose invisible pressure on her, she said: "I feel that I'm doing well in dealing with pressure in the whole game. Ding Ning is playing very well today, but I haven't found my pace. "
For activating rural consumption, it is necessary to rely on the normalization mechanism to purify the market, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance the sense of gain in farmers’ consumption.
According to data, the consumption potentiality of rural residents has been continuously released. In the first half of this year, the retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5%, and the growth rate is 1.3 percentage points higher than that of towns.
During the visit to a poor village in a western county, there is only one convenience store in the whole village. Stepping into the store, some items are the brands we familiar with, however there are lots of fake good, such as "金龙鱼" is labeled as "金龙油" and "旺仔" labeled as "旺奶".
Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed. Some rural fake and inferior products imitate famous brands, they have similar names and packages to mix the false with the genuine, which is really hard to prevent.
A consumer survey report released by a city in the west shows that rural shopping malls and supermarkets have a serious problem of fake products, and 66% of users have bought fakes in supermarkets in villages and towns offline, of which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant departments claim to rectify the rural markets every year, while, why the phenomena of fake products still occur repeatedly?
Different from the urban markets, farmers’ awareness of rights protection is relatively weak, and many villages are in remote locations within the blind areas of inspection force can’t reach, so that the fake and inferior goods have a breeding ground.
One product has more than one regulatory departments, some are responsible for price, some are for production, and others are for markets, so the functions are overlapped. Strong measures against fake and inferior products have been taken every year, however the central management can only last for a period of time. On one hand, the fakes escape the crack down trend and slowly emerged, on the other hand, the previous fakes just have been dealt and the new fake came out.
Some unscrupulous traders have initiated the idea of "going to the mountainous areas and the countryside" and some rural areas become the "waste elimination markets", both of these problems are because of long-term supervision mechanism, difficulties in purifying rural markets, low illegal cost and higher profit.
From food and clothing to well-off, the majority of farmers are moving towards development type consumption.
A few days ago, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Some Opinions concerning Stimulating the Consumption Mechanism to Further Encourage the Consumption Potential of Residents", which proposed to promote the level upgrading of the consumption of rural residents. The purpose is to make the majority of farmers to "have ability to consume", "have willing to consume" and "dare to consume" to let the rural consumption really flourish.
On the one hand, we must deepen reforms, eliminate drawbacks of market management policies coming from multiple departments and regulate by more than one departments. According to local conditions, improve the food safety, product quality supervision network, and constantly reduce the space for rural fake products manufacturing and selling.
On the other hand, it is necessary to intensify law enforcement and open up the supervision of each department, and never allow the fake and inferior commodities to breed in the countryside.
It is the protection for farmers to severely punish the behavior of entrapping farmers. No matter how concealed the counterfeiters hide, it should not be the reason for the breeding of the fake and inferior commodities. Relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, and the grassroots supervisory powers should go down. If there is a problem in any part, it is necessary to investigate the responsibility and let the counterfeiters and selling persons have nowhere to hide.
Strictly control the market access, implement strict qualification examinations for production operators. Keep the market circulation, let the products have clear sources and outlet markets. Think of ways from the source and the roots, let the legal dealers operate with peace of mind, and let the farmers buy with confidence.
Activate rural consumption, guide the demand for healthy consumption.
As consumption upgrading, many farmers not only pursue of well fed and eat well, but also go after for high quality life with culture and healthy. Thus, rural markets are not equal to "low quality" and "low price".
This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, connect the urban and rural two-way linkage sales channels, promote the combination of offline industry development platform and online e-commerce trading platform, support the new forms and new modes of consumption to expand into the rural market; promote qualified villages and towns to combine trade logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, and product processing dynamically; improve the rural modern circulation network system, optimize the integration of stock facilities resources, and effectively reduce rural circulation costs.
Create a clear and reassuring market environment for the rural areas, so that farmers can afford to buy, so that the rural consumption can become more and more prosperous and the farmers’ senses of gain and happiness can be enhanced.
Our country will reduce the MFN tariff rate for some goods from November 1, and the general tariff level will be reduced to 7.5%.
According to the decision of the 26th executive meeting of the State Council, the Tariff Commission of the State Council announced on September 30 that the MFN tariff rate for some goods would be reduced from November 1, 2018.
According to the "Tariff Commission of the State Council's Announcement on Reducing the Import Tariff for Some Goods", the MFN tariff rate for some goods, including the industrial goods, would be reduced from November 1, 2018 in order to adapt to the industrial upgrading, reduce the enterprise costs, and satisfy people's demands of multilevel consumption.
There were 1585 taxable items in total for the tax reduction goods, which accounted for about 19% of total taxable items in our country. The average tax rate was reduced from 10.5% to 7.8% by an average of 26%.
This tax reduction mainly involved the textiles; stones, ceramics, glass products; some steel and base metal products; electromechanical devices and parts, such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, electric transmission and transformation equipment, electrical appliances, instruments and apparatus, etc.; resource goods and primary processed goods, such as non-metal ores, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, gemstone and jade, etc.
Meanwhile, with the reduction of general tariff level, especially the import tariff reduction of medicine and consumer goods, the taxable items and tax rate for import tax on imported goods would be reduced accordingly.
In order to implement the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, our country had implemented the zero tariff on most imported drugs since May 1 this year, had reduced the import tariff for automobiles and parts and some consumer goods since July 1, and had implemented the third step of tax reduction for products in the extended scope of Information Technology Agreement.
The reporter learned from the Tariff Commission of the State Council that the general tariff level in our country was reduced from 9.8% of the previous year to 7.5%, by an average of 23% after several continuous independent adjustments.
Proper tariff reduction would be beneficial to accelerating the balanced development of foreign trade, promoting the higher-level opening to the outside world, overall planning and using the international and domestic resources, and boosting the domestic supply-side structural reform.
The relevant responsible person of the Commission said that this year was the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up. Taking the initiative to reduce the general tariff level was the practical action of implementing the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Boao Forum for Asia, and our country's important measure of further opening up and actively expanding imports based on our demand for high-quality development. These action and measure showed that China would unswervingly pursue the mutually beneficial opening-up strategy, strengthen the motive of self-development, and deliver benefits to the world through its development.
On September 29th, the regional public brand launch event for the "Huanxiangren" agricultural products of Huan County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin.
Red Army millet, black bean, mountain kids madrigal black goat, hardcover buckwheat tea, paper-cutting shadow puppets book, handmade slippers... All pieces of beautifully packaged agricultural products is neatly placed on the stand, they have a common brand name called "Huangxiangren".
"Create a regional brand of "Huanxiangren" has effectively solved the development bottleneck of agricultural products in the Huan County, which is ‘more but not centralized, small and weak’, and it has become a powerful carrier for poverty alleviation." On September 29th, the regional public brand launch event for the "Huanxiangren" agricultural products hosted by Huan County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin.
Huan County is located at the junction of the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia. It is known as the "National Grain Production Advanced County", "China’s Minor Grain Crops Township" and "China’s Shadow Puppets Township". It has a long history and rich resources.
Local snacks such as lamb meat, yellow millet wine, buckwheat noodles, and oat noodles are the flavors that people often think of when they are away from their hometown.
As the level of urbanization in China continues to increase, the urban population has increased rapidly, and a large number of rural young people have left their hometowns to start urban life.
Yang Qiaojia, an expert on agricultural brand research in China, said: "Currently, urban life is fast-paced and stressful. More and more people are beginning to miss their rural life when they were young. However, ‘the place that cannot go back is the hometown, and the most beautiful memory is from the country’, the brand design of ‘Huanxiangren’ is named after the provincialism and homesickness of the wandering people of Huanhuan County. "
The climate conditions in Huan County are special, the sunshine time is long, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the conditions for planting special minor grain crops are richly endowed by nature.
There are more than 20 kinds of minor grain crops in the county. It is the hometown of China’s minor grain crops, and its output ranks first in Gansu, and its quality is front ranked in the country.
Wang Xiaoli is a Huan County girl who went to school in Tianjin. She participated in the promotion meeting as a volunteer. She said: "The people in my hometown are the most dear people, and the taste of the hometown is the most beautiful. The brand of ‘Huanxiangren’ has evoked too many homesickness and memories. What I have never forgotten is the food at childhood. I hope that the brand of ‘Huanxiangren’ will go further and further and become bigger and bigger. "
Dr. Tan Bin, a researcher at the Academy for National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration, said that through the detection of more than 900 sets of indicators, the detection data of agricultural products such as buckwheat, tartary buckwheat and black beans in Huanxian County are outstanding, and many physiological activators in miscellaneous grains are high. "Huanxiangren" has the inherent advantage of seizing the domestic high-end miscellaneous grains market.
Chai Chun, secretary of the County Committee of the Huan County, said that through the publish of the "Huanxiangren" brand, it can further improve the quality, standardization and scale of innovation and development of quality agricultural products in Huan County, which is conducive to shaping the good overall image of agricultural products in Huan County and rapidly increasing its popularity, competitiveness and added value.
The gross domestic product (GDP) of Canada grew by 0.2% in July compared with the previous month, with a higher-than-expected growing rate, raising market expectations that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If it does, it will be the fifth time in a bit more than a year that the bank raises interest rates.
The analysts of Reuters who made an interview previously forecasted a 0.1% increase.
The Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries had achieved growth.
The data is noteworthy for the reason that the Bank of Canada predicted earlier this month that temporary factors could drag down the third-quarter GDP data.
Poloz, the president of the Bank of Canada, promised on Thursday that the bank would continue to gradually raise interest rates and pay close attention to the economic data.
The Bank of Canada will announce its next interest rate decision on October 24.
The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017 as the Canadian economy has strengthened and the unemployment rate is close to record lows.
Stephen Brown, the senior Canadian economist at Capital Economics, said that the country's third-quarter GDP was expected to grow at an annualized rate of around 2%.
"This will be 1.5% higher than the expectation of the Bank of Canada, which will be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month," he said in a report.
Overnight index swaps show that the market forecasts for probability of risings of interest rate of the Bank of Canada in October rise from 76.46% to 78.27%.
North Korea and South Korea jointly inspected the entrance of Han River for the first time over the past 65 years
On Day 5, the South Korea Defense Ministry confirmed that on the same day, North Korea and South Korea launched joint inspection in the water area of the entrance of Han River and Imjin River.
This action is early-stage preparations to ensure the free navigation of civilian vessels for both sides.
The notification provided by the South Korea Defense Ministry to the media on the same day showed that this was the first joint inspection of the entrance of Han River for both sides since the signing of the Korean War Armistice Agreement in 1953.
North Korea and South Korea signed a military agreement in September, and agreed to jointly inspect the entrance of Han River and other water areas from November, in order to ensure the environmental protection, tourism development and other aspects in such water areas in the future.
In October, North Korea and South Korea planned a joint inspection of the water areas during a general-level meeting.
On November 5, the joint inspection of the water areas of North Korea and South Korea was officially launched.
The joint inspection delegation consisted of 20 military personnel and experts from North Korea and South Korea.
According to the introduction of the South Korea Defense Ministry, during this inspection, personnel from both sides didn’t carry arms and were forbidden to use the words and deeds that could irritate the other side.
"Since there is no military demarcation line near the entrance, this area was once an accident-prone region. But through joint inspection, it will become a new peaceful area in the future. "
The total length of the water areas which were jointly inspected by North Korea and South Korea was about 70 km and the total area was about 280 square kilometers.
The South Korea Defense Ministry said that South Korea would send six inspection vessels to explore the depth of the sea water to provide basic information for the safe navigation in such water areas; after the investigation was completed, navigation maps would be provided for civilian vessels.
In October 2007, North Korea and South Korea held a summit talk in Pyongyang and reached an agreement on the joint use of the entrance of Han River and Imjin River, while subsequent negotiations deadlocked due to tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by South Korea and North Korea in September, vessels of both sides only need to inform the other side in advance before sailing in common waters in the future.
Report on November 5 of China News: the website of the Chinese embassy in Mongolia reported on November 5 that Chinese citizens Guo Yuqin and Mao Runxin had been missing when traveling in Mongolia, .
It was understood that these two people were members of the Blue Sky Rescue team. On October 19, they contacted their relatives and friends in China and said they would immediately explore the mountains near the Khovsgol Lake. They shared their location via WeChat and then went missing. It was suspected that they had headed for the no man's land.
The Chinese embassy in Mongolia always paid high attention to the protection of the lawful rights and interests and safety of Chinese citizens in Mongolia, as well as the consular protection and assistance.
After being informed of the information about the two tourists going missing, the embassy immediately activated the contingency plan for consular protection, strived to seize the prime time for rescue and spared no efforts to work.
The embassy maintained close communication with the two tourists' families, assisted them in immediately reporting the case to the Mongolian police, and provided them with a list of interpreters for their choice.
The embassy made an appointment with the heads of the Mongolian Foreign Relations Department, the General Bureau of Police and the General Bureau of Emergency at first time to report relevant information. The embassy requested the Mongolian side to carry out the search and rescue operation as soon as possible and maintained close communication with the Mongolian side during the search and rescue process to ensure to keep up the latest progress.
Meanwhile, the embassy assisted the family members in publishing the notice for missing persons in Mongolia, and extensively mobilized overseas Chinese and Chinese-funded enterprises in Mongolia to actively participate in searching the missing persons, provide effective clues. The embassy also provided relevant assistance to the members of the Blue Sky Rescue team who went to Mongolia for assistance.
Under the strong boost of the embassy, the Mongolian side immediately sent a rescue team and promised to exempt the search and rescue costs.
The General Bureau of Police and the General Bureau of Emergency of Mongolia instructed the police and emergendy department of Hovsgol province to spare no efforts to search and rescue the missing persons.
Since Khovsgol Lake was located at the border of north of Mongolia and Russia, its location was in remote, and it was a vast territory with a sparse population of which transportation and communication was extremely inconvenient. Meanwhile, Mongolia has currently entered the winter, and the temperature was as low as around -20 degrees. The local police and emergency department overcame great difficulties, almost to mobilize all forces and stimulate the local herdsmen to carry out the carpet search and rescue operation around the wide range of the position where two people lost for days on end through the ways of horse riding, walking, and visiting the herdsmen.
Meanwhile, in view of special conditions in the pastoral areas, the Mongolia side has been circularly publishing the notice of missing persons through the radio for days.
Relevant staff of Chinese Blue Sky Rescue team have also come to Mongolia to actively participate in the rescue work together with the Mongolian side.
The safety of the two missing persons has always affected our hearts.
To date, the two people have been lost for more than 10 days. The embassy successively received some clues, but still cannot find them. The search and rescue operation was still under way.
The embassy would always follow the principle of "people first", sustain attention to this matter, push the Mongolian side to continue the all-out search and rescue operation and provide maximum assistance to the two persons' families.
The embassy appeals to the compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia to contact the Chinese embassy in Mongolia at first time for any relevant clues.
Michael Jackson wore tape on his nose to get front pages, former bodyguard claims
Michael Jackson's former bodyguard has claimed the late singer cultivated some of his eccentricities with the deliberate intention of riling up the media.
Matt Fiddes, now a property developer and owner of a martial arts/dance chain, told Metro that Jackson believed the fascination around his persona would stop if he ceased to be a "mystery" in the public eye.
To get front pages, he would reportedly don surgical masks and put tape on his nose to spark conversation.
We'll tell you what's true. You can form your own view.
"He knew how to manipulate the media. He knew exactly how to get the front page," Fiddes, who was Jackson's bodyguard for 10 years, said. "90 per cent of the time it worked, by putting a mask on his face, or sticky tape on his hands - or tape on his nose was a favourite one. He would say he wanted his life to be the greatest mystery on Earth."
He added: "It's backfired on him now, though, that's the sad thing."
Fiddes also addressed allegations of child sexual abuse against Jackson by Wade Robson and James Safechuck, which were aired in the controversial, Emmy Award-winning documentary Leaving Neverland.
Both Robson and Safechuck allege that they were abused by Jackson as children for a number of years.
Fiddes claimed that "this whole paedophile thing is complete nonsense... the guy had girlfriends and had a legitimate marriage to Lisa Marie [Presley], that was the way he lived his life."
He claimed it would have been "impossible" for Jackson to have abused children at his Neverland ranch because he was "hardly" there.
"They say there were boys around, that was not the case at all," he said.
The Jackson estate has denied all allegations against the late star. Jackson denied all claims against him until his death in 2009.
Government Retires 15 More Senior Tax Officials On Graft Charges
New Delhi:
The government has compulsorily retired 15 more tax officers in the fourth tranche of its crackdown on errant officials accused of corruption and other malpractices.
The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) -- the agency that oversees GST and import tax collections -- compulsorily retired 15 senior officers under Fundamental Rule 56 (J) on corruption and other charges, official sources said.
Since June, this is the fourth round of sacking of corrupt tax officials. In the previous three rounds, 49 high ranking tax officers, including 12 from the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), were compulsorily retired.
Sources said the action was in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort when he had said some black sheep in the tax administration may have misused their powers and harassed taxpayers, either by targeting honest assesses or taking excessive action for minor or procedural violations.
"We have recently taken the bold step of compulsorily retiring a significant number of tax officials, and we will not tolerate this type of behaviour," he had said.
Nearly half of the officials retired were those who were arrested by the CBI for allegedly receiving illegal gratification. One of them was caught accepting a bribe of Rs 15,000. One official is accused of having assets disproportionate to his known source of income.
In June, the government had compulsorily retired 15 commissioner-level officials of CBIC on charges of corruption, collecting and giving bribes, smuggling and even criminal conspiracy. Prior to that, the government had compulsorily retired 12 senior IRS officials from the Income Tax department over charges of corruption, sexual harassment, disproportionate assets under Rule 56 (J) of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules.
In August, the government compulsorily retired 22 CBIC officials. The Rule 56 (J) of Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 provides for periodical review of the performance of government servants with a view to ascertain whether they should be retained in service or retired in public interest.
As per these instructions, the cases of government servants covered by FR 56 (J), 56 (1) or Rule 48 (1) (b) of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 should be reviewed six months before they attain the age of 50-55 years, in cases covered by FR 56 (j) and on completion of 30 years of qualifying service under FR 56 (1) or Rule 48 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.
A woman in Maine got 500 letters from United Healthcare within five days
Stephanie Lay said she found the piles of letters from the insurance company stashed in her mailbox between Thursday and Monday.
"A week ago Thursday was the first wave of letters, I got 46 letters," she told CNN. "I immediately called United Healthcare insurance and told them I received 46 letters of the same letter."
And the letters just kept coming, piling up to more than 500 by Monday.
They were addressed to her son, who has autism and lives in a private care facility, she said. But instead of her son's name inside when you opened them, the letters said Dear Maine's Department of Health and Human Services -- in Cincinnati, she told local media.
The letters were about a $54 or $0 healthcare claim that United Healthcare said is not covered, Lay said.
When she asked United Healthcare why she was receiving a mountain of letters, she was told it was a coding issue, she said.
In a statement, United Healthcare told CNN it's working to resolve the issue but it cannot provide details due to privacy requirements.
"We have determined the cause of the problem. We are very sorry this occurred, and we have contacted the family to discuss the situation with them," the health insurer said.
Lay said the letters all have a message at the bottom urging people to go paperless. " I'm thinking they had to take down half of a forest just to send this," she said.
Antonio Brown says he's not quite ready for retirement
Antonio Brown has indicated he's not retiring from the NFL, only a few days after announcing he was done with the league in a Twitter rant.
The four-time All-Pro wide receiver wrote on Twitter on Thursday: "I'm still the best why stop now." He followed with the suggestion that the game needs him.
Brown has been accused of sexual misconduct by two women. He was released by the New England Patriots last week after playing only one game. He's been dumped by three teams in the last six months.
Brown, who lost Nike as a sponsor last week, says he'll practice at high schools one day a week, starting in Miami.
The 31-year-old Brown also engaged in a Twitter spat with Los Angeles Rams safety Eric Weddle, who faced him often with the Baltimore Ravens.
HSBC flips crime-spotting tool to scope new business
British bank HSBC (HSBA.L) has converted a financial crime-spotting algorithm it was forced to build in the wake of a money-laundering scandal into one that can scope out new business opportunities, bank executives said.
The system combines data on clients" banking activities, with public data on company ownership and directorships, to flag desirable potential clients to HSBC staff and offer ways to connect to them through existing relationships.
Using data and artificial intelligence to try and boost revenues is part of HSBC's broader push to squeeze more out of its large physical network and client data, a key priority for interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn.
"It's one of the first commercial uses of investment in financial crime prevention, and the business we're getting in this way is inherently lower risk and quicker to win," said Stuart Nivison, HSBC's global head of client network banking.
HSBC declined to comment on how much it expects to make from the new system but said the broader "network income" initiative has already yielded hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue.
The drive is an important part of the bank's efforts to defend its global presence at a time when some analysts and investors are saying it should shrink or exit markets like the United States where it makes returns below its cost of capital.
HSBC was forced to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in financial crime compliance as part of a $1.9 billion settlement in 2012 with U.S. authorities over the bank's failure to prevent money laundering by drug cartels though its Mexican unit.
The system works by mapping individual customers" and companies ties to each other and then looking for unusual patterns of transactions or unearthing previously unknown connections between those entities.
That system has already freed up more than 400 staff to go from manually checking transactions and records to client-facing roles where they can spend time helping customers, said Adrian Rigby, chief operating officer of HSBC's trade business.
HSBC's Nivison said the lightbulb moment was realizing the tool could be repurposed to look for "green flags" of attractive potential clients rather than "red flags" of wrongdoing.
"We took our customer dataset and combined it with (Britain's) Companies House data and turned the algorithm around to look for attractiveness in a client, whether that be through sector, growth of the company, and connection to existing clients," Nivison said.
The tool has mapped 22.5 million entities and people in Britain, and can identify in three minutes a network of connections that a staff member would have taken three hours to map out manually, he said.
Iran was promised that 'all' US sanctions would be lifted in return for talks, Rouhani claims
European nations were so eager to negotiate with Iran that they suggested the US would end its sanctions regime if Tehran was willing to engage in dialogue, President Hassan Rouhani has said.
According to Rouhani, European signatories of the 2015 nuclear deal urged him to meet with US President Donald Trump, promising that Washington would lift "all" sanctions in return.
"Three out of the six countries, that is the chancellor of Germany, prime minister of Britain, and president of France, all insisted for the meeting to be held, saying that the US would lift all sanctions," stated the Iranian president.
He said he rejected the proposal because, "under sanctions and maximum pressure," it would have been impossible to predict the end result of any negotiations.
Trump quickly denied that he had offered Iran any relief, tweeting that Tehran had asked him to lift sanctions as a prerequisite to talks, but that he had "of course" refused.
In his statement, Rouhani also said that numerous countries were on Iran's side during their one-on-one talks on the sidelines of the UNGA. "We discussed various issues with various countries, and all of them condemned the United States" withdrawal from the JCPOA and its pressures. This is a huge success for Iran."
Dog control laws to be reviewed in government consultation
Dog control laws in Scotland are being reviewed amid concerns about out-of-control animals and irresponsible owners.
A consultation has been launched by the Scottish Government seeking the public's views.
Scotland's Community Safety Minister pledged to "keep communities safe from irresponsible owners," with reviews to determine whether laws for out-of-control dogs need changing.
Ash Denham MSP said: "We are holding two reviews into dog control legislation because we are absolutely determined to help keep communities safe from irresponsible owners and their out-of-control dogs.
"This consultation seeks views on improvements on how the Control of Dogs Act 2010 can operate across Scotland, and next year we will take a wider look at all dog control legislation to assess whether changes are needed.
"Owning a dog brings with it certain responsibilities, including keeping your dog under effective control, and I encourage everyone with an interest in this area to respond to our consultation."
The consultation runs until January 15 and contains proposals to toughen and clarify the current legislation, including questioning whether a national dog control database should be created.
The Scottish Parliament's Post-Legislative Scrutiny Committee has been hearing evidence from victims and parents of children who have been attacked or killed by dogs, prompting the Government to review dog control laws.
MSPs were told the legislation needs urgent reform to protect vulnerable people and children.
The committee heard that, in Greater Glasgow and Clyde alone, there were 1,417 people arriving at A&E departments with dog-related injuries, 255 of them children, last year.
NHS Lanarkshire treated 912 people and NHS Ayrshire 439, both four-year highs.
In July, the committee's MSPs concluded current dog control legislation is not fit for purpose and called on the Scottish Government to undertake a comprehensive review of all dog-control laws.
Convener Jenny Marra said: "Dog law in Scotland is not fit for purpose. There are still far too many dog attacks on children and little enforcement or understanding of the current laws that might prevent these attacks.
"It has become clear that current dog control law doesn't work. It needs reform urgently so that out of control and dangerous dogs can be dealt with properly and we can try to move to a system that prevents our children being injured by dogs."
The consultation, launched on the Government's website on Friday, says: "Effective and consistent enforcement across Scotland is fundamental in helping address issues relating to out-of-control dogs.
"This review is focused on steps that can be taken to help aid enforcement agencies such as local authorities, as they use their powers to help keep communities safe."
Saudi Arabia To Offer Tourist Visas For First Time, Abolish Abaya Rule
Visas in Saudi are currently restricted to expat workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims.
Saudi Arabia said Friday it will offer tourist visas for the first time, opening up the ultra-conservative kingdom to holidaymakers as part of a push to diversify its economy away from oil.
Kickstarting tourism is one of the centrepieces of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 reform programme to prepare the biggest Arab economy for a post-oil era.
The announcement comes just two weeks after devastating attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure -- blamed by Washington on Iran -- which roiled global energy markets and raised fears of a wider regional conflict.
"Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," tourism chief Ahmed al-Khateeb said in a statement.
"Visitors will be surprised... by the treasures we have to share -- five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, a vibrant local culture and breathtaking natural beauty."
Saudi Arabia will open applications for online tourist visas to citizens of 49 countries on Saturday, Bloomberg News quoted Khateeb as saying.
Khateeb said the kingdom will also ease its strict dress code for foreign women, allowing them to go without the body-shrouding abaya robe that is still mandatory public wear for Saudi women.
Foreign women, however, will be required to wear "modest clothing," he added, without elaborating.
Visas in the desert kingdom, endowed with rich bedouin heritage and archaeological sites, are currently restricted to expat workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims travelling to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
In a rare move, Saudi Arabia last year began issuing temporary visas to visitors to attend sporting and cultural events in a bid to kickstart tourism.
But the austere kingdom, which forbids alcohol and has a strict social code, is seen by many as a hard sell for tourists.
Prince Mohammed is seeking to change that through a sweeping liberalisation drive that has brought new cinemas, mixed-gender concerts and sporting extravaganzas to Saudi Arabia.
International criticism of the kingdom's human rights record, including the gruesome murder last year of critic Jamal Khashoggi and a crackdown on female activists, could further put off foreign visitors, observers say.
Fears of a regional conflict after the September 14 attacks on state oil giant Aramco may also dampen the kingdom's appeal to holidaymakers.
The government, reeling from low oil prices, says it hopes tourism will contribute up to 10 percent of the gross domestic product by 2030, compared to three percent currently.
It says by 2030 it aims to attract up to 100 million annual visits by both domestic and foreign tourists.
But the kingdom currently lacks the infrastructure to accomodate visitors in such high numbers, with officials estimating 500,000 new hotel rooms will be required nationwide over the coming decade.
The sector is expected to create up to one million tourism jobs, the government says, as it battles high youth unemployment.
Saudi Arabia has splurged billions in an attempt to build a tourism industry from scratch.
In 2017, the kingdom announced a multi-billion dollar project to turn 50 islands and other pristine sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts.
Last year, construction of Qiddiya "entertainment city" was launched near Riyadh, which would include high-end theme parks, motor sport facilities and a safari area.
The country is also developing historic sites such as the centuries-old Mada'in Saleh, home to sandstone tombs of the same civilisation which built the Jordanian city of Petra.
Facebook hides 'likes' in new Australia trial
Facebook has begun hiding the number of "likes" for posts in Australia, it said today, a trial designed to ease social pressure that could be rolled out worldwide.
Account holders across the country will also be blocked from viewing the number of reactions and video views on other people's posts from today, but will still be able to see how people respond to their own.
"We don't want Facebook to feel like a competition," the company said in a statement.
"This is a test to see how people engage with this new format. We hope to learn from this over time in order to see if we will roll this out more broadly," it said.
More than one billion people use Facebook worldwide, but the social media giant has come under pressure to combat the platform's impact on mental health.
In Australia, one in five children report experiencing cyberbullying, according to the country's eSafety commissioner.
Facebook's decision comes after it launched a trial in July to hide "likes" on the company's other major social media platform, Instagram.
What began as a test on Instagram in Canada was expanded to Australia, Brazil and several other major markets.
The Facebook trial was described as "a limited test in order for us to get some early learnings."
"While this has been testing on Instagram, Facebook and (Instagram) are different surfaces and we will likely see different data come from this test," the company said.
The social media giant did not confirm how long the trial would run for.
"We want to understand from people whether removing the total counts improves their experience, while also not limiting any positive interactions," said Mia Garlick, of Facebook Australia.
Lorenzo strengthens into Category 4 hurricane east of Caribbean
Hurricane Lorenzo strengthened into a Category 4 storm Thursday, producing swells that could affect parts of the Windward Islands and South America, the National Hurricane Center said.
The eye of the major hurricane was about 1,660 miles southwest of the Azores in the NHC's 11 p.m. EDT update. The storm was moving north-northwest at 14 mph with 145 mph maximum sustained winds.
The storm isn't forecast to make landfall in the coming days, though a turn toward the northeast Saturday could bring Lorenzo near the Azores in the middle of next week. Forecasters predict the storm will weaken below Category 3 on Monday.
Swells generated by the storm could cause life-threatening surf and rip currents in the Windward Islands and northeastern South America.
Lorenzo is the season's second Category 4 or higher storm. Dorian reached Category 5 status near the Bahamas.
According to Colorado State University Meteorologist Philip Klotzbach, the Western Hemisphere, which encompasses the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins, has generated 16 named storms since Aug. 21.
"This is the most on record for the Western Hemisphere between Aug. 21-Sept. 23, breaking the old record of 15 named storms set in 1984 and 2002," he wrote on Twitter.
Patriot missile system to Saudi Arabia after Iran oil attacks
U.S. Soldiers talk after a routine inspection of a Patriot missile battery at a Turkish military base in Gaziantep, Turkey.
The Pentagon on Thursday announced that the U.S. will send a Patriot missile battery, radars and roughly 200 support personnel to Saudi Arabia in the wake of the attacks on its oil facilities earlier this month.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper has "approved putting additional forces on prepare to deploy orders," Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman wrote in a statement. "While no decision has been made to deploy these additional forces, they will maintain a heightened state of readiness."
Those additional forces include two Patriot missile artillery batteries and one Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD missile defense system.
THAAD, one of the world's most advanced missile systems, can target incoming missiles and blast them out of the sky. THAAD interceptors, fired from a truck-based launcher, use kinetic energy to deliver "hit to kill" strikes to ballistic threats.
"It is important to note these steps are a demonstration of our commitment to regional partners, and the security and stability in the Middle East. Other countries have called out Iranian misadventures in the region, and we look for them to reinforce Saudi Arabia's defense," Hoffman wrote.
President Donald Trump slammed Iran's alleged role in the attacks on Saudi oil facilities, telling world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that they should pressure Tehran into diplomatic talks.
"All nations have a duty to act," Trump said regarding his call to counter Iranian behavior. "No responsible government should subsidize Iran's bloodlust. As long as Iran's menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted, they will be tightened."
The Sept. 14 strikes on the world's largest crude-processing plant and oil field forced Saudi Arabia to shut down half of its production operations. The drone attacks triggered the largest spike in crude prices in decades and renewed concerns of a budding conflict in the Middle East. While Tehran has been widely blamed for the attacks, it maintains that it was not involved.
Skydiver dies after crashing into big rig trailer on California highway
The 28-year-old woman was skydiving with a group of seven people around 2 p.m. Thursday, California Highway Patrol PIO Ruben Jones told CNN.
The group took off from the Lodi Parachute Center. CNN has reached out to the facility for comment.
Conditions were windy, and the woman crashed into the truck during the skydiving group's descent near the Lodi Airport, Jones said.
The station spoke to Lisa Reyes, who was driving with her father and brother on Highway 99 when the woman crashed.
"The way the person was struggling, just struggling against the wind and their body was just moving really, really fast," she told the station.
'Hideous' Central Coast camouflage child rapist ordered to look at victim in court
Dressed in a leafy Ghillie camouflage suit, the man grabbed the then 12-year-old from behind and dragged her into bushland as she made her way to school on the state's Central Coast in May 2017.
He then tied her to a tree and sexually assaulted her.
Shortly after the arrest, a search warrant was executed at a home where officers seized a number of items relevant to the investigation.
The man pleaded guilty to seven charges involving the attack and a further three charges over the grooming and sexual abuse of another girl, aged 11, between August 2016 and April 2017.
The 12-year-old victim had been walking along a track when she looked back and saw him suddenly emerge from the bushes armed with a large tree branch and a knife.
An example of a camouflage Ghillie suit the man used.
When she pleaded "stop, stop, stop," he put her in a headlock and forced her into the scrub.
The man told the girl: "Shhh, don't scream. Don't scream or I'll have to hurt you."
Holding the knife in his right hand, he tied her hands and feet with cable ties before lashing her to the tree and abusing her for almost an hour. After he cut her loose, the girl ran crying hysterically to school.
The man arrived at work about 9.30am after failing to reply to several text messages and phone calls from colleagues.
With dirt, grass and tree matter on his clothes, he claimed to have been involved in a road rage incident where he had chased another driver into the bush and fallen down an embankment.
The man's sentencing hearing continues on Tuesday.
No federal charges in fatal California police shooting
Federal authorities declined to pursue civil rights charges Thursday against Sacramento police officers who fatally shot an unarmed black man, a killing that sparked protests and spurred changes to a state law governing when authorities can use deadly force.
The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI said a federal review of the 2018 shooting of 22-year-old Stephon Clark found "insufficient evidence" to pursue charges against Officers Terrance Mercadal and Jared Robinet. Both will be returned to active duty.
The California attorney general's office in March declined to issue state criminal charges after a nearly yearlong investigation. Attorney General Xavier Becerra said then evidence showed the officers had reason to believe their lives were in danger because he was advancing toward them holding what they thought was a gun. Investigators found only a cellphone.
Sacramento police also announced Thursday their internal investigation did not find any policy or training violations.
"Although no policy violations occurred in this incident or in the events leading up to it, we are committed to implementing strategies that may prevent similar tragedies in the future," Sacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn said in a statement.
Clark's brother, Stevante Clark, posted on Facebook Thursday that he was in a meeting with federal and local authorities. "These people have failed when it comes to (accountability)," he wrote.
Authorities have said the officers believed Clark was approaching them with a gun after he ran from them into his grandparents" backyard. The officers had been pursuing Clark after receiving calls about someone breaking car windows and an elderly neighbor's sliding glass door.
The officers shot Clark seven times as he approached them.
The federal investigation looked at evidence such as witness statements, audio and video recordings, dispatch records, police reports, and autopsy reports to determine whether the officers acted willfully with the intent to use objectively unreasonable force.
Lawmakers last month updated the nation's oldest law governing police use of deadly force, making it now among the country's most comprehensive when combined with additional training.
California's old standard made it rare for police officers to be charged following a shooting and rarer still for them to be convicted. It was based on the doctrine of "reasonable fear," meaning if prosecutors or jurors believed officers had a reason to fear for their safety, they could use lethal force.
The new law, which takes effect Jan. 1, will allow police to use deadly force only when "necessary" to defend against an imminent threat of death or serious injury to officers or bystanders.
Pope warns tech execs to use AI for the common good
Pope Francis on Friday warned tech company executives, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development pose the risk of increasing social inequality unless the work is accompanied by an ethical evaluation of the common good.
Francis addressed a Vatican conference that brought government envoys and Facebook and Google representatives together with philosophers, physicists and ethicists. A smattering of academics and Catholic bishops rounded out participants at "The Common Good in the Digital Age" conference.
The three-day gathering is the latest evidence of the Vatican wanting a place in the debate over the prospects and perils of artificial intelligence.
The debates included technology advancements in warfare and the future of work with increasing reliance on machines, as well as a case study examining the Christchurch, New Zealand, massacre and decisions taken by social media companies after video spread of the carnage.
In his speech to the conference, Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that machines at the dawn of the industrial revolution spared workers dangerous and monotonous labor. But he warned that increased reliance on robotics for the sake of profits risked depriving people of the dignity of labor.
"If technological advancement became the cause of increasingly evident inequalities, it would not be true and real progress," he warned. "If mankind's so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good, this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest."
Organizers of the conference said they hoped to tap into participants" expertise identify possible future advisers for the Catholic Church on high tech issues.
The House voted Friday to block the national emergency declaration President Donald Trump is using to fund his proposed border wall.
The Democratic-held chamber passed a resolution to terminate Trump's action by a 236-174 margin, sending it to the president. Eleven Republicans and one independent supported it. The Senate already approved the measure in a 54-41 vote, as 11 Republicans joined Democrats in backing it.
Trump will likely veto the resolution, the sixth time he will have blocked congressional legislation as president. He already vetoed a measure to end the emergency declaration in March.
Neither chamber of Congress appears to have the two-thirds majority needed to override the president's opposition.
Failing to get the funding he desired for borders on the southern border from both the Mexican government and Congress, Trump declared the national emergency in February. His administration plans to pull $3.6 billion from military construction to fund border projects.
Democrats have accused Trump of both circumventing Congress' power of the purse and raiding key Defense funds for unnecessary barriers. A handful of Republicans in both the House and Senate also had concerns about the precedent Trump's declaration would set for executive overreach in the future.
Some Senate Republicans facing elections next year have faced sharp political pressure over the national emergency vote.
Google Marks Its 21st Birthday With a Doodle: All You Need to Know
Google is marking its own birthday today with a doodle. The doodle features a photo of a 90s' style computer with Google search page and date stamp for September 27, 1998, surrounded by confetti in Google colours. A smaller doodle with number 21 as candles, as a part of Google logo, shows on the search results page. The search giant was founded 21 years ago in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then students at Stanford University in California. September 27 is, however, not Google's actual birthday.
If you take the company's incorporation date as its birthday, then Google was born on September 4, 1998, however, the company never celebrated the day as its birthday, at least not in the form of a doodle. Google celebrated September 7 as its birthday in doodles until 2005, following which it switched to September 27.
Initially, the search engine was called "BackRub" and it was later renamed "Google."
"We chose our systems name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100 and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines," Sergey Brin and Lawrence (Larry) Page wrote in 1998 in a paper published about launching a prototype of a "large-scale search engine."
The company got its start thanks to Sun co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim who invested $100,000; in June 1999, the company had raised a $25 million round from Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins. Google moved to its Mountain View location in the same year, where it remains. In 2001, the company was granted a patent for its technology.
What started out as a Web search engine has since turned into a massive conglomerate that calls itself Alphabet and Google is a subsidiary company. Today, Google operates all over the world in over 100 languages, answering trillions of search queries each year.
"The relentless search for better answers continues to be at the core of everything we do," Google writes on its Our Story page. "Today, with more than 60,000 employees in 50 different countries, Google makes hundreds of products used by billions of people across the globe, from YouTube and Android to Smartbox and, of course, Google Search. Although we've ditched the Lego servers and added just a few more company dogs, our passion for building technology for everyone has stayed with us - from the dorm room, to the garage, and to this very day.
Oil falls after Iran claims US offered to remove sanctions, Trump denies
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani makes a speech during a ceremony in Tehran, Iran on January 10, 2019.
Oil slid after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani claimed Friday that the U.S. offered to remove all sanctions on Iran in exchange for negotiations. President Donald Trump and the State Department later denied those claims, causing oil to rebound from the lows.
WTI crude futures were last down by 0.9% to $55.91 after falling as low as $54.79. Brent crude futures dropped 1.4% to $61.89.
"The German chancellor, the prime minister of England (Britain) and the president of France were in New York and all insisted that this meeting take place. And America says that it will lift the sanctions," Rouhani said on his official website, according to Reuters. "It was up for debate what sanctions will be lifted and they (the United States) had said clearly that we will lift all sanctions."
Trump later said he responded "of course, NO!" to Iran who he said wanted him to lift the sanctions in order to meet.
The State Department called the report "baseless," adding the U.S. is committed to zero oil exports from the Iranian regime, Bloomberg News said.
Rouhani's comment came after a series of drones attacked oil facilities in Saudi Arabia on Sept. 14, which had forced the kingdom to cut production in half. The U.S. and some European countries, as well as Saudi Arabia, have blamed the attack on Iran. Tehran has denied any role in the incident. The Trump administration also announced plans to deploy U.S. forces to the region.
The State Department didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
"There's been a big bearish risk from a thaw in the US Iran situation for some time and this will put a remarkable amount of oil back onto the market immediately if it were to occur," said John Kilduff of Again Capital.
"It's not just Iranian production and exports. Its' millions of barrels in floating storage and millions of barrels sitting in China's ports waiting to be processed by customs," Kilduff said.
Trump last year withdrew the U.S. from a nuclear deal between Iran, the U.S. and five other countries that removed sanctions from the country in return for its commitment to end its nuclear.
The Islamic Republic, a target of U.S. sanctions for decades, was blamed by Washington for recent attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, which Tehran denies. Iran also shot down a U.S. military drone and announced plans to execute 17 suspected U.S. spies.
Afghanistan boosts security for presidential election
A massive security operation is in place across Afghanistan for the country's presidential election on Saturday.
About 100,000 security personnel are to guard polling stations in the wake of Taliban threats.
The fear of reprisals means many voters - particularly in rural areas - will stay at home, while others say the voting system favours the powerful, not the poor.
Royal news: How Princess Beatrice "reacted with fury at hostile family members"
On Thursday, The Duke and Duchess of York announced that their eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, is engaged to her boyfriend, the 34-year old property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. The Princess, who is ninth-in-line to the throne, will tie the knot with Mr Mapelli Mozzi next year. The couple said in a statement: "We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together.
"We share so many similar interests and values, and we know that this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead, full of love and happiness."
Princess Beatrice's parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, also shared their excitement.
The Duchess of York wrote on Twitter: " I know what a mother feels so I have tears of joy. I am so proud of this sensational news.
"Andrew and I are just the luckiest people ever to have two great sons in law."
The royal wedding will be another occasion for the entire Royal Family to get together, and hopefully completely repair Fergie's relationship with the Duke of Edinburgh.
Since Sarah was embroiled in one of the Royal Family's biggest ever scandals, her relationship with the rest of the members has been extremely difficult.
Five months after announcing she was separating from Prince Andrew in 1992, compromising photographs of her with her "financial advisor" were taken at her holiday villa in St Tropez.
The snaps appeared to show Texan millionaire John Bryan kissing and sucking the Duchess" toes and the arch of her foot, and Prince Philip in particular, is said to have had the strongest reaction to her daughter-in-law's scandalous antics.
However, his behaviour was reportedly "appalling" towards the Duchess of York, and Princess Beatrice once claimed her mother was the victim of "mean spirited actions to make her feel unwelcome."
JUST IN: Kate and William behind closed doors: Couple's shock habit exposed
The report noted that the Duchess" spokesman was unable to comment on the claims, but a friend of Fergie was quoted as saying: "It is no secret that Sarah's daughters are pretty fed up by the way their mother has been treated by some members of the Royal Family.
"Some of the bills she has been sent have been pretty miserly.
"They are constantly berating their father for allowing it to happen and Beatrice in particular has been imploring Prince Andrew to see that their mother is not treated as an outcast."
Philip and Sarah were pictured for the first time together in 26 years at Princess Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank last October.
The Next Big Labor Strike Hits Oregon
The state university workers" most pressing complaints center on low wages and a lack of dignity at work. The pay disparities alone are shocking. About half of these workers earn less than $40,000 per year (and hundreds make less than $25,000). Meanwhile, university presidents" annual salaries average out to $500,000 and four university athletics coaches are pulling down a cool $1 million. While school administrators enjoy six-figure salaries and overall administrative spending continues to bloat, one in six classified staffers qualify for food stamps.
As Alejandro Segurra, another IT worker at Portland State University, said, "I'm willing to go on strike because I don't think it's fair that people are paid wages that don't allow them to live in the city that they serve." Portland State library worker Theresa Stapleburg was even more direct: "I want to strike because I've been here 24 years, and I need a raise - a living wage."
As inflation climbs and the cost of living in Oregon soars, these workers are being left to flounder, and management has shown little sympathy for their plight. Contract negotiations that began in February broke down in mid-August. At that point, the bosses had laid out some particularly egregious proposals - a paltry cost-of-living increase, a denial of seniority demands from long-term university workers, and a price hike for staff meals - that workers saw as disrespectful, and even cruel. "There is an unwritten class system at the universities," Fulmer said. "And we are at the bottom of it."
"Education workers have been under attack for decades," he continued. "We are finally standing up and fighting back. It's one thing to see classism and the squeezing of the middle class in the corporate world as executives see their relatively obscene pay continue to go up at rates above inflation. But for the same thing to be happening in education is not something workers will continue to tolerate."
And Oregon's state university workers aren't the only ones taking action. Oregon is a powder keg of militancy right now, and its fuse is now burning bright and hot. Grocery store workers at the Fred Meyer supermarket chain are ramping up their campaign against their employer, and while there are no official plans to strike yet, tensions are running high; their union, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555, has already called for a boycott, and filed an unfair labor practice report against the chain.
In the healthcare sector, the 4,500 members of the Service Employees International Union Local 49 workers at Kaiser Permanente authorized a strike (with a 98 percent approval rate) if a deal isn't reached before their existing contract expires in October - which was only narrowly avoided with a new tentative agreement. Elsewhere in the industry, the Oregon Nurses Association, which represents more than 120 nurses at Astoria Hospital, has been deadlocked in contract negotiations with the hospital administration; their last contract expired in May, and the clock is ticking.
"Oregon has a really strong labor movement that is really building from the ground up," Burley explains. "This is a part of the national wave of labor growth. People are seeing a precarious economy where real wages are falling and the solution is collective action in the workplace."
It's unclear just how deeply such collective action may take root this fall, but it certainly would be fitting if the general strike returned to the Northwest in 2019. And from there we can only hope that its spirit will spread even further, into the heart of Midwestern farming, Southern manufacturing, Texan oil fields, Appalachian coal mines, Northeastern construction, the Silicon Valley tech giants, and everywhere in between. Lord knows that something's gotta give.
Civility in Politics: New awards scheme set up to counter Westminster division and recognise politicians who show courtesy
A new awards scheme has been set up to recognise politicians who show courtesy in their work.
It comes after a divisive week in Westminster following the return of Parliament.
It was marked by threats against MPs and outrage over the language used by the likes of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
To counter the division, the "Civility in Politics" awards were announced on Friday, with the politician of the year to be awarded £3,000 to give to charity.
Boris Johnson has been criticised for the tone of language he has used in the Commons chamber
Lord Stewart, announcing the awards, said: "Everyone agrees that politics in the UK is facing a crisis of trust and a crisis of civility.
"As divisions and bitterness mount in the continuing debates around Brexit, we strongly believe that politics has to respond not by mirroring these trends, but by bucking them.
"These awards are a small attempt by a group of people in public life - of different and no political persuasions - to shine a spotlight on politicians who argue their case with decency and civility, and are able to engage and work with people across the divides that affect us all."
Nominations will open on Saturday, with an award ceremony in March next year.
In an exclusive interview with the Standard, former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd today accused Mr Johnson of deploying aggressive language that "does incite violence."
Mr Johnson, for his part, said he "deplores" threats made against MPs.
Jess Phillips 'frightened' after receiving 'be afraid' death threats
On Thursday, Labour MP Jess Phillips - another one of those to have criticised Mr Johnson - said a man was arrested after trying to "kick the door" of her constituency office while reportedly shouting that she was a "fascist."
Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, meanwhile, was speaking to police following threats made to one of her young children.
And in a viral Twitter thread, Ellie Cooper, the daughter of senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper, described her fears for her mother in the wake of Ms Cox's murder . She accused Mr Johnson of "using language that helps incite violence toward MPs."
Setting the example? Income inequality in the US is at an all-time high
Last year the income gap between richest and poorest people in the US stood at its highest level since 1967, the first year the Census Bureau started tracking it. DC and New York are among places where the differences are worst.
The US may be the world's wealthiest nation, but it is also one where the super-rich thrive no matter what while the desperately poor often rely on GoFundMe to pay their medical bills. The economic inequality affects both wealth and incomes, with the latter being at an all-time high.
One way to measure income inequality is the Gini index. It measures between 0, a score for absolute equality and 1, which stands for a hypothetical situation in which a single household gets all income in a nation. The Census Bureau has been tracking the index for over 50 years. In 1967 it stood at 0.397 but, in 2018, it rose to 0.485, the highest figure on the record.
There are nations with worse income inequalities, including some with reasonably strong economies. For example, the World Bank estimates that South Africa's Gini index stood at 0.63 in 2014 while Brazil's was 0.53 in 2017. By comparison, all EU countries have a Gini index below 0.4.
The new data shows that income inequality is most acute in places where wealth is concentrated, including DC, New York and Connecticut, as well as in poverty-ridden areas like Puerto Rico and Louisiana. Utah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota had the most economic equality.
The census also showed a stagnating growth of median household income, which grew to over $62,000. It's the highest level ever measured by the American Community Survey, but the increase was just 0.8 from 2017 to 2018, much smaller compared to increases in the previous three years and amounting to virtually no growth at all if adjusted to inflation.
The new statistics will likely put some wind into the sails of progressive Democratic contenders for the party nomination for next year's presidential election, who call for leaning on the super-wealthy individuals and on big corporations to pay more taxes.
It may also undermine the rationale behind the current administration's corporate tax breaks, which were passed through Congress in 2017. The goal was to convince multinationals to bring back manufacturing jobs as money trickles down to the middle and poor classes. In practice, it seems, it led to extra bonuses for executives and the rest of the country largely missing out on the benefits a growing economy and record low unemployment. Well, someone needs to pay for all those private jet trips.
North Carolina man wins five times in the same lottery drawing
A North Carolina man won five times in the same lottery drawing, including a $163,634 jackpot.
Add Lancaster of Pikeville told North Carolina Education Lottery officials he used five sets of his own numbers to buy a Cash 5 ticket with five plays for Monday night's drawing when he stopped at Wissam & Brothers Inc. in Pikeville.
"My wife writes down the numbers for me during the drawing," Lancaster said. "When she handed me the paper, so I could check my ticket, I couldn't believe it. One of my lines matched five numbers and the other ones matched four numbers. I started shouting, 'I got it! I got it! I hit the lottery!'"
Lancaster's line that matched all five numbers earned him the $163,634 jackpot, while the lines that matched four numbers each won $250.
The winner said he plans to use the money to pay his bills and make some home repairs.
Khloe Kardashian's cheating ex Tristan Thompson leaves ANOTHER desperate comment on her Instagram pic after rumours he wants her back
KHLOE Kardashian's cheating ex Tristan Thompson has left ANOTHER desperate comment on her Instagram page following rumours that he wants her back.
The 35-year-old star dumped the NBA player for good earlier this year after he was accused of cheating on her with family friend Jordyn Woods - having previously cheated when she was nine months pregnant with their daughter, True.
Tristan was spotted leaving another gushing compliment on Khloe's Instagram page
However, 28-year-old Tristan is refusing to give up without a fight - leaving a cringeworthy compliment on his ex's latest selfie.
In the blurred snap, Khloe is stood in front of the rising sun, with the mum-of-one captioning the pic: "May you have the courage to explore every dream you dream."
Publicly commenting, Tristan wrote: "The sun is shining bright on a beautiful [diamond emoji]."
Fans were outraged by the remark, with one replying: "Yeah, a diamond that you DROPPED."
Tristan cheated on Khloe when she was nine months pregnant
Another advised: "Just get off Instagram."
A third wrote: "Don't fall for it Khloe."
It comes just days after Tristan wrote: "Perfection" alongside the heart eye emojis underneath one of the reality stars other photos, which saw her modelling for Guess Jeans.
Earlier this month, The Sun revealed that Tristan bought Khloe a £400,000 Porsche in a bid to win her back - on the advice of Drake.
He was then accused of cheating again earlier this year - with Kardashian family friend Jordyn Woods
He settled on the grovelling gift, thought to be a 911, after being urged to pull a "power move" by his rapper pal.
As a result, pals said Tristan even won an invite from Khloe to a 'Taco Tuesday' dinner at her mansion - bringing him one step closer to a reunion with the reality star and their 17-month-old daughter True.
A source said: "Tristan is good pals with Drake and has been using him as a sounding board as he plots his return to the Kardashian fold.
Khloe was left heartbroken by Tristan's infidelity
"Drake told him to pull out all the stops if he wanted to win Khloe back.
"An invite to a casual dinner might not sound like a reasonable trade off for a sleek supercar.
"But after what Tristan did, he can't expect Khloe to roll out the red carpet for him."
The pair are mum and dad to 17-month-old True
Khloe Kardashian breaks down in tears and screams at cheating boyfriend Tristan Thompson in new Keeping Up With The Kardashians series 16 trailer
The Sun revealed last month that Tristan planned to invite Khloe on a romantic trip to Greece after vowing: "I will get my family back."
Khloe has been left heartbroken by Tristan's repeated cheating throughout their romance, but still invited him to their daughter True's first birthday party earlier this year.
However, the star's family reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians later showed that the event ended with Khloe in tears as she struggled to come to terms with his infidelity.
Stem cells of 56 child cancer patients lost at Children's Hospital after freezer malfunction
A freezer malfunction at Children's Hospital Los Angeles resulted in the loss of 56 children's blood stem cells that were harvested at the beginning of each patient's oncology therapy and stored in the event they could prove useful in the future.
"We apologize for any distress or confusion that this has caused our patients and their families," the hospital wrote in a statement. "If you have not received a letter or phone call from our team, your child is not impacted."
All but one patient had gone through initial therapy. That patient did require the recollection of stem cells, chief medical officer James Stein said.
A letter sent to families earlier in September informing them of the loss was accidentally addressed to the children - rather than the parents. The hospital has also apologized to parents for the messaging oversight.
The hospital said that the loss of stem cells, which had been placed in long-term storage, has not jeopardized any child's health. The hospital has also offered to assist families who want to harvest again. But the process can be grueling.
One of the patients described it as "painful." Sean Anderson Corona, 13, underwent stem cell therapy when he was diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuroblastoma - a cancer often found in the adrenal glands. The boy was hooked up to machines for a daylong process that collects the stem cells from the blood. The blood is then reinfused back into the body.
"I would try to sleep and my body would just start shaking, and then I just started to freak out and I'd start crying," Corona told ABC-7.
Corona will be cancer-free for three years in November. But his mother, Elizabeth Anderson, said that she worries that if his cancer does return, it may be impossible to harvest more stem cells from his blood.
Stein said that the recollection of patients" stem cells would only be recommended in the event that they are needed in the event that the patient relapses.
"We think that's going to be incredibly unlikely so we wouldn't ask anyone to do that in advance," he said.
The freezer has since been replaced, and the sensor-monitoring and alert system have been upgraded.
"Obviously, this is a huge deal for us." Stein said. "We're reaching out directly to every single family in person to make sure that all their questions are answered."
Prince Harry walks across Angolan minefield to reconnect with Princes Diana's legacy
It's day six of the Duke of Sussex' royal tour of Africa with his wife Meghan and baby Archie. But Friday morning, Harry returned to Angola alone to reconnect with the legacy of his late mother, Princess Diana.
Diana's legacy was brought full circle when Harry donned the distinctive blue body armor of the HALO Trust. Twenty-two years ago, Diana took a similar path across an Angolan field scattered with deadly landmines, left over from years of civil war. It became one of the most iconic images of her short life.
Wearing protective body armor and a visor, Diana, Princess of Wales, visits a minefield being cleared by the charity Halo in Huambo, Angola, January 15, 1997.
She was campaigning to rid the world of this weapon of war, but never lived to see her success, dying just months before an international treaty banned landmines in December 1997.
Over two decades later, the world is still not free of these devices. And echoing his mother, loud and clear, Prince Harry detonated a recently detected mine.
"Landmines are an unhealed scar of war," Prince Harry said. "By clearing the landmines we can help this community find peace, and with peace comes opportunity."
Prince Harry detonated a recently detected mine in Angola.
Thomas Cook pension trustees plot deal to salvage payouts
Thomas Cook's pension funds have kicked off talks with specialist insurers about a deal to salvage the collapsed travel group's retirement scheme benefits.
Sky News has learnt that Steve Southern, chair of the trustees, is holding talks with several parties about a buyout deal that would avoid most of Thomas Cook's 14,000 pension scheme members facing a steep cut to their payments.
Any deal with an insurer would be likely to involve a more modest cut to payouts than the 10% triggered by a pension scheme's transfer into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) lifeboat.
The discussions are at a very preliminary stage and - even if successful - will not result in a deal until after the Thomas Cook schemes have been through an assessment by the PPF.
Thomas Cook bosses face investigation into what led to collapse
That period could take up to two years, and if the schemes do enter the PPF will result in roughly 10,000 future pensioners having their payouts cut by 10%.
Sources said that a number of pension risk transfer specialists, as well as at least one of the new "superfund" consolidation vehicles, were in talks with Thomas Cook's trustees about a deal.
News of the trustees' efforts to secure members' benefits comes four days after Britain's oldest tour operator ceased trading, sparking an international repatriation programme and triggering thousands of job losses.
Thomas Cook's descent into insolvency has sparked a bitter blame game, with board members, government ministers and auditors all facing demands to explain their actions in the months before its collapse.
The company's four pension schemes are well-funded, with a £100m surplus on a PPF basis, according to the latest figures.
Collectively, they hold assets worth about £1.5bn.
However, as Sky News revealed last month, the trustees' demands for better terms in Thomas Cook's proposed rescue deal added a further complication to efforts to get the transaction across the line.
Thomas Cook's liquidation brought to an end 178 years of solvent trading, prompting the launch of inquiries by the government's Insolvency Service, the accounting watchdog and an influential committee of MPs.
Ministers have established a taskforce to address the crisis, which has left creditors facing meagre returns from the post-insolvency sale of assets.
To date, just under half of Thomas Cook's overseas British customers have been flown home.
Its collapse came hours after Thomas Cook issued a last-gasp plea to its lenders to reduce a £200m funding demand.
What went so wrong for Thomas Cook?
The talks, which concluded without a deal on Sunday evening, represented a frantic last throw of the dice for a company which had been forced to seek more than £1bn in new funding following a £1.5bn half-year loss and deteriorating trading.
Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 by a 32-year-old cabinet-maker and former Baptist preacher who began offering one-day rail excursions from Leicester to Loughborough for a shilling.
From there, it went on to become one of the world's largest holiday companies, marking its 175th anniversary three years ago.
A PPF spokesperson said: "Insolvency events, like the liquidation of Thomas Cook, are exactly why the PPF was set up.
"We are here to protect the financial futures of members belonging to defined benefit pension schemes and they should take comfort knowing we are here to protect them."
A spokesman for Thomas Cook's pension trustees declined to comment on Friday.
Adorable pictures show new-born rhino nuzzling her mother and exploring new home
Baby Stella was welcomed into the world at Cotswold Wildlife Park, Oxfordshire, earlier this month and is the first female born to parents Monty and Ruby.
The youngster, who is healthy and nursing well, can be seen wondering about her enclosure before resting alongside her mother on a bed of straw.
Mother Ruby joined the wildlife park in 2009 alongside another female called Nancy in the hope that one would produce the park's first ever calf with Monty.
Nancy then gave birth to a female named Astrid in 2013, with Stella being the third female calf born at the park in its 49-year history.
Jamie Craig, curator of Cotswold Wildlife Park, said: 'We have had tremendous success with our current rhino herd.
'Stella is the sixth youngster from Nancy and Ruby and our bull, Monty, has proved to be an excellent dad.
'He is the perfect combination of a dominant bull and caring patriarch.
'It is particularly satisfying that Ruby has produced a female calf - these are vital for the development of the breeding programme and Stella will eventually move to another collection to hopefully become a successful mother herself.'
Ruby has had two boys before, Ian in 2015 and Alan in 2017. Alan is still at the park whilst Ian is in Torino Zoo in Italy
When Alan was just one-week old he weighed around eleven stone.
Births in captivity are considered extremely rare. Females only reproduce every two-and-a-half to five years, so the window of opportunity for successful reproduction is limited.
According to the park, a typical gestation period lasts between sixteen to eighteen months, after which a single calf is born.
It is considered the longest gestation periods of any land mammal, surpassed only by the twenty-two month gestation period of an Elephant.
A newborn Rhino calf will stand up within one hour of birth. Once born, the calf will immediately attempt to suckle, although he or she may be a little unsteady on their feet for the first few days.
It will remain under the watchful eye of the mother, suckling from her for approximately one year.
Their bond is an intensely strong one and the calf will remain with its mother for at least two years, benefiting from her protection. Females guard their offspring aggressively and are intimidating adversaries if challenged.
Incel virgin Alex Minassian told Toronto police he was part of 4chan group
Footage has emerged of a man alleged to have killed 10 pedestrians in Toronto telling police that he was part of an online group for sexually frustrated men.
Alek Minassian, 26, said that he was part of the involuntary celibates (incel) forum on 4chan.
He is now facing 10 counts of murder in Canada and 16 counts of attempted murder following the attack on April 23, 2018.
When asked about the deaths, he told police: "I feel like I accomplished my mission."
When the incident happened, it brought attention to the online world of loneliness, rage and misogyny.
Minassian said that he had contact with a killer in California who was angry at women who had rejected him.
He stands accused of driving a rental van into crowds of pedestrians in a busy north Toronto neighbourhood. Eight women and two men ranging in age from 22 to 94 died.
Minassian has yet to enter a plea. His trial begins in February, but a publication ban on his interrogation by police was lifted today. The police interview took place just hours after the attack.
Minassian, who said he never had a girlfriend and was a virgin, acknowledged he used the van as a weapon and said he wanted to inspire more attacks.
He said: "I know of several other guys over the internet who feel the same way," but added that they are "too cowardly to act on their anger."
Minassian calls himself an "incel," short for "involuntary celibate." The incel movement is an online subculture linked to the deadly attack in Toronto as well as attacks in California and Florida. It promotes the misogynistic idea that men are entitled to have sex with women.
Over time, "incel" has become a buzzword for certain men infuriated at being rejected by women and prone to float ideas for violent payback, according to sociologists and others who study them.
Like-minded people in internet forums sometimes use "Chad" and "Stacy" as dismissive slang for men and women with more active sex lives.
Minassian said he discussed his sexual frustrations on the website 4chan, which has become notorious as a place for extremists to post their views.
US theater chain bans dressing up for "Joker" screenings over fears of another shooting
The largest US independent theater chain won't let people in cosplay watch the critically acclaimed origin story of Batman supervillain "Joker." Face paint and masks are already banned, but safety fears still remain.
Most US cinemas have banned masks, face paint and toy weapons after the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, which happened during a screening of another Batman flick, "The Dark Knight Rises." The gunman wore a Joker costume when he went on a gun and tear-gas rampage, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. Body costumes that don't hide a person's identity, however, have been generally allowed in theaters.
However, Landmark Theaters has now announced that it will not allow customers to wear costumes during screenings of the R-rated "Joker."
"I want customers to be comfortable in their surroundings," Landmark President-CEO Ted Mundorff told the Hollywood Reporter.
The company is based in Los-Angeles and runs 52 theaters in 27 markets, which makes it the biggest specialized theater chain in the country.
Meanwhile, Kansas-based AMC Theatres, the largest chain in the country, reiterated its ban on "masks, face paint or any object that conceals the face," but said they will welcome viewers in costume.
The ban on masks and fake guns was mostly due to practical security reasons, but as the release of "Joker" draws closer, there are concerns that it may trigger a copycat gun attack. The LAPD said it would "maintain high visibility" around theaters on premier day, while Regal Cinemas, the second-largest chain in the country, said it was implementing security protocols developed "in collaboration with NATO."
The US Army went as far as advising service members to watch out for "incels," disgruntled males who can't get a date, who supposedly idolize the Joker and may mimic his brutal ways.
"Joker," which is directed by Todd Phillips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as the title character, is due to be released on October 4 in the US, and is expected to become a box office hit. It follows the descent of a socially isolated and mentally unwell person, as he becomes the mass-murdering, green-haired, pale-faced nemesis of Batman.
It received rave reviews at its Venice International Film Festival premiere this year, taking the top prize. The film is a psychological thriller loosely based on the comic book series. Some commenters voiced concerns that it may cause harm by depicting the protagonist in a sympathetic way and including graphic and realistic violence. However, the creative team behind it said their work is meant for mature audiences who are expected to be able to tell right from wrong.
Midway Broadcasting announced today that its Chairwoman, Melody Spann Cooper is set to release her highly anticipated book to help female entrepreneurs and executives thrive in business. "The Girlfriend's Guide To Closing the Deal" shares insights on how women can use their voice to achieve equity at the negotiating table and advance their careers by using the female edition of the old-boy's network.
Throughout the book, Spann Cooper uses anecdotal references to deal with challenging issues including the #MeToo movement and Hillary Clinton's Presidential defeat and its impact on fueling the female empowerment in America.
The self-published book is the result of a groundbreaking self-entitled speech that Spann Cooper delivered as a keynote address at The National Association of Women Business Owners Conference in Chicago in 2017. The Girlfriend's Guide to Closing The Deal is written in a down-to-earth style that every "girlfriend" can relate.
Christie Hefner, businesswoman and daughter of Playboy Founder, Hugh Hefner, says "The Girlfriend's Guide to Closing The Deal" is both highly entertaining and very helpful. Melody weaves together personal anecdotes, triumphs, and setbacks with useful lessons learned. From how to own your ideas in a meeting to when its time to "friend up," everyone can benefit from Melody's story."
As Chairman of Midway Broadcasting Corporation, she joined an elite list of America's female broadcast owners after purchasing the company's controlling interest in 1999. Midway Broadcasting Corporation is a best-in-class female and family-owned media boutique whose properties include radio and interactive platforms.
The book was co-written with T. Shawn Taylor, journalist, writer and founder of Tree Top Consulting, a full-service media consulting firm.
Romania Invests Billions in a Black Sea Military Base
Romania will spend 2.5 billion euros to modernize the Black Sea military base as part of counteracting Russia's growing presence in the region, according to The Times, quoted by the FOCUS News Agency. Mikhail Koglignichanu Airbase, located about 200 km. east of Bucharest, will be aligned with NATO standards, as evidenced by documents published by local news sites. Up to 10,000 NATO F-35 soldiers and aircraft can be accommodated there. It is planned to become a "mini-city" for the military with kindergartens, sports clubs and a hospital.
The base has already become a center of increased NATO activity in the Black Sea, which has become a key area of tension between Russia and the West. After Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin began to increase its naval presence in the Black Sea, using the deep-sea base in Sevastopol to carry out naval missions in Syria. Russia is also hampering shipping in the region and last year captured three Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait.
Romania and Bulgaria, located on the Black Sea coast, which in the past were allies of the USSR, have joined NATO and the EU since its collapse. In response to Russia's actions, they have asked the alliance to strengthen its presence in the region, writes The Times. In February, 500 US troops arrived at Romania's air base. An Eurofighter Typhoon fighter squadron of the British Air Force is stationed and deployed. Since April last year, these aircraft have repeatedly intercepted Russian fighter jets. Georgia, located on the eastern Black Sea coast, is also concerned about Russia's aspirations. It is not a member of the alliance, but is involved in NATO military exercises. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during a visit to Tbilisi in March that the alliance was "preparing" Georgia for accession. Ukraine has also participated in NATO exercises in the region and has been developing its engagement with the Union since 2014.
Ukraine, the "New Berlin Wall," Once Again Lies at the Center of Scandal
Mr. Poroshenko's eagerness to win over Mr. Trump and his growing fears that political rivals would thwart his re-election opened the way for Mr. Giuliani to press Ukraine's prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko, who has since been fired, to help Mr. Trump's own re-election by investigating Joe Biden and his son.
How Mr. Poroshenko expected the Trump administration to help lift his sagging fortunes ahead of Ukraine's presidential election, held in two rounds in March and April this year, is unclear. He got trounced anyway, losing emphatically to Mr. Zelensky, whose own officials quickly became the Trump team's new targets in its drive to damage Mr. Biden.
While Democrats want Mr. Trump impeached over his dealings with Ukraine, the president and his allies have counterattacked with their own Ukraine-focused scandals. They have revived a debunked theory that the country colluded with the Clinton campaign to hurt Mr. Trump's chances in 2016 and asserted, with little evidence, that Mr. Biden used his position as vice president to prevent Ukraine from investigating his son.
Ukrainians, jaded after years of watching their own leaders trade the power and privileges of office for personal financial or political gain, have mostly shrugged off what, for Mr. Trump, is possibly the most serious scandal to buffet the White House since Watergate toppled President Richard Nixon in 1974.
That a country few Americans paid much attention to in the past now commands center stage in Washington has stirred mostly bemusement in Ukraine. Those feelings are also tinged with a touch of pride that, after centuries in the shadow of Russia, its giant neighbor to the north, the nation is no longer seen as a backwater but a pivot around which the fate of the world's most powerful country implausibly turns.
Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine's foreign minister under Mr. Poroshenko, said in a caustic Twitter message this week that going down in history "as the country that led to the impeachment of the U.S. president" was "not a very fun prospect." But, he added, "Now everyone understands what we are capable of."
Brother Jailed For Life For Pakistan Social Media Star Qandeel Baloch's Honour Killing
Qandeel Baloch, who shot to fame for her social media photos, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was on Friday convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison in the patriarchal country's highest-profile "honour killing."
Baloch, who shot to fame for her risque selfies -- tame by Western standards, but considered provocative in deeply misogynistic Pakistan -- was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested. Days later he told a press conference that he had no remorse over what he did, saying that "of course" he had murdered his sister and that her behaviour had been "intolerable."
His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told AFP the court in the eastern city of Multan had found his client guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment, in a long-awaited verdict.
"Inshallah (God willing), he will be acquitted by a high court," he said.
Earlier, Baloch's mother Anwar Mai told AFP she had hoped her son would be acquitted.
"He is innocent. She was my daughter and he is my son," she said.
Baloch's murder made international headlines and reignited calls for action against an epidemic of so-called "honour killings," in which a victim -- usually a woman -- is murdered for flouting patriarchal social codes.
Women have been burned, shot, stabbed and strangled for offences such as choosing their own husband or -- in Baloch's case -- bringing "shame" on their family by celebrating their sexuality.
The killings are usually carried out by a close relative. Under Pakistan's Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (retribution) law, they can then seek forgiveness from a victim's relatives.
Three months after Baloch's murder, parliament passed new legislation mandating life imprisonment for honour killings.
However, whether a murder is defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion, meaning that killers can theoretically claim a different motive and still be pardoned.
In Baloch's case, her parents initially insisted their son would be given no absolution.
But, heartbroken at the thought of losing him also, they changed their minds and said they wanted him to be forgiven.
International revulsion at the killing had seen the Pakistani state take the unprecedented step of declaring itself an heir alongside the parents, however, forcing the case to move ahead.
Some of Baloch's better-known actions included offering to perform a striptease for the Pakistani cricket team, and donning a plunging scarlet dress on Valentine's Day.
She attracted criticism and threats but was perceived by many, including young people, as breaking new ground in a country where presenting yourself as a Kim Kardashian-like figure can be seen as a bold, political act of women's empowerment.
The roots of "honour" killings lie in tribal social norms, which remain prevalent across South Asia and dictate the behaviour of women in particular, though men can be victims too.
Three Scottish students named among Europe's best
Three University of Dundee students have been named regional winners as top graduates in Europe.
The University of Dundee students were named as top graduates in their respective fields in Europe in the 2019 Global Undergraduate Awards, whilst five other students from the same university were praised by the judges.
Scott Sheldrick, who graduated in Molecular Genetics, won the Europe award for Life Sciences, Chester Cornford studied MSc Mental Health Nursing and was awarded the Nursing, Midwifery & Allied Healthcare prize, whilst Lola Knibb won the Visual Arts award.
Although all three made it through to the global final, they lost out in the final round to strong competition from some of the 3,500 entrants from across the world.
Professor Blair Grubb, Vice-Principal (Education) at the University, said: "To get to this stage, our students and graduates faced competition from peers attending some of the world's top universities.
"The Undergraduate Awards are fiercely contested by thousands of students around the world and it is a great reflection of the quality of our students, and the education they receive here, that Dundee is so strongly represented amongst the prize winners.
"I would like to offer my warmest congratulations to Scott, Chester and Lola on this fantastic achievement, alongside the other Dundee representatives who were highly commended."
Another five students were commended in the world's leading undergraduate awards programme, which recognises top work completed by undergraduates to share this with a global audience.
Included in the five praised students were Nicholas Gallagher and James Osbourne (both Life Sciences), Ferenc Kohsuke Ishikawa Gutai (Medicine), Caitlyn Scott (Anatomical Sciences) and Waco Yokoyama (Philosophy).
The competition further celebrates top undergraduate coursework and helps create collaborations between students and recent graduates worldwide.
Oldest galaxy protocluster forms 'queen's court'
Using the Subaru, Keck, and Gemini Telescopes, an international team of astronomers has discovered a collection of 12 galaxies which existed about 13.0 billion years ago. This is the earliest protocluster ever found. One of the 12 galaxies is a giant object, known as Himiko, which was discovered a decade ago by the Subaru Telescope and named for a mythological queen in ancient Japan. This discovery suggests that large structures such as protoclusters already existed when the Universe was only about 800 million years old, 6 percent of its present age.
In the present Universe, galaxy clusters can contain hundreds of members, but how these clusters form is a big question in astronomy. To understand the formation of clusters, astronomers search for possible progenitors in the ancient Universe. A protocluster is a dense system of dozens of galaxies in the early Universe, growing into a cluster.
Yuichi Harikane, a JSPS fellow at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan who led the team of astronomers explains, "A protocluster is a rare and special system with an extremely high density, and not easy to find. To overcome this problem, we used the wide field of view of the Subaru Telescope to map a large area of the sky and look for protoclusters."
In the map of the Universe made by the Subaru Telescope, the team discovered a protocluster candidate, z66OD, where galaxies are 15 times more concentrated than normal for that era. The team then conducted follow-up spectroscopic observations using the W.M. Keck Observatory and Gemini North telescope, and confirmed 12 galaxies which existed 13.0 billion years ago, making it the earliest protocluster known to date.
Interestingly, one of the 12 galaxies in z66OD was a giant object with a huge body of gas, known as Himiko, which was found previously by the Subaru Telescope in 2009. "It is reasonable to find a protocluster near a massive object, such as Himiko. However, we're surprised to see that Himiko was located not in the center of the protocluster, but on the edge 500 million light-years away from the center." said Masami Ouchi, a team member at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and the University of Tokyo, who discovered Himiko in 2009. Ironically, the mythological queen Himiko is also said to have lived cloistered away from her people. Ouchi continues, "It is still not understood why Himiko is not located in the center. These results will be a key for understanding the relationship between clusters and massive galaxies."
Nancy Pelosi is subject of book by daughter Christine Pelosi
An upcoming book on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi comes from someone who knows her well, daughter Christine Pelosi.
"The Nancy Pelosi Way" will be released Nov. 26, Skyhorse Publishing announced Thursday. Christine Pelosi's book will examine how a mother of five became the first female house speaker and her current leadership of House Democrats during the Trump administration. According to Skyhorse, Christine Pelosi will weave together "the professional and personal experiences" of her mother.
Christine Pelosi is a Democratic Party strategist and author of "Campaign Boot Camp" and "Campaign Boot Camp 2.0." Pelosi's sister, Alexandra Pelosi, is a filmmaker and journalist who has made several documentaries about contemporary politics.
Warren's lemonade money went to a pro-life charity
When Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) purchased drinks from two girls running a lemonade stand in August, she may not have been aware that her $10 purchase would be donated to a pro-life charity.
"Our daughters thought [Warren] was nice," Dan Michels, a Trump supporter and a father to one of the girls, told the Washington Free Beacon. "She came by and told us we should vote for her. And our daughters told us she was a nice person, but we don't align with her politically and ... because she's pro-choice, we said we should donate her money to a pro-life [cause]."
On August 8, Warren stopped by a lemonade stand staffed by two 11-year-old children, Sienna Michels and Audrey Billings, during a campaign bus tour across Iowa.
"Stopped for a quick drink at a lemonade stand in Harlan, Iowa. When life gives you lemons, make big structural change!" Warren said on Twitter.
The two kids were excited about meeting a presidential candidate in person. The Michels girl urged her parents to vote for the Massachusetts senator in 2020 after the photo op. The parents instead explained Warren's stance on abortion. The girls and their parents decided to donate to the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, a non-profit that supports pro-life legislation.
"My daughter told us she wanted us to vote for her," Michels said. "We talked about the abortion part of things and said maybe we should donate money to stop abortion, and my daughter was all for that."
Why viruses like Herpes and Zika will need to be reclassified: Biotech impact
New research reveals that the way viruses were perceived in terms of their architecture will need to be retooled, because they are actually structured in many more patterns than previously understood. The findings could have significant impact on how they are classified, our understanding of how they form, evolve and infect hosts, and strategies to identify ways to design vaccines to target them.
In the 1950s and '60s as scientists began to obtain high resolution images of viruses, they discovered the detailed structure of the capsid -- an outer protective layer composed of multiple copies of the same protein -- which protects the virus' genetic material. The majority of viruses have capsids that are typically quasi-spherical and display icosahedral symmetry -- like a 20-sided dice for instance.
The capsid shell is what protects them, and as scientists discovered their structure, they proposed that capsids could have different sizes and hold different amounts of genome, and therefore could infect hosts differently.
Why this matters
When designing drugs to target viruses, scientists can now take their varying structural shapes into account to improve efficacy.
Two researchers who study the structures of viruses, Antoni Luque, a theoretical biophysicist at San Diego State University and a member of its Viral Information Institute, and Reidun Twarock, a mathematical biologist from the University of York, UK, and a member of York's Cross-disciplinary Centre for Systems Analysis, show that many viruses have essentially been misclassified for 60 years, including common viruses such as Herpes simplex and Zika.
This was because despite having the structural images from cryo-electron microscopy, we did not have the mathematical description of many of the architectures of different viruses.
"We discovered six new ways in which proteins can organize to form icosahedral capsid shells," Luque said. "So, many viruses don't adopt only the two broadly understood capsid architectures. There are now at least eight ways in which their icosahedral capsids could be designed."
They used a generalization of the quasiequivalence principle to see how proteins can wrap around an icosahedral capsid.
Their study, which will be published in Nature Communications on Friday, September 27, also shows that viruses that are part of the same structural lineage, based on the protein that they're composed of, adopt consistent icosahedral capsid layouts, providing a new approach to study virus evolution.
Biotech applications
Structural biologists can now take this information and reclassify the structure of the viruses, which will help unveil molecular and evolutionary relationships between different viruses.
It will also provide a guide to engineer new molecular containers for nanotech and biotech applications, and it will help scientists to identify specific strategies to target the assembly of proteins in the capsid. This can eventually lead to a more systematic approach to developing antiviral vaccines.
"We can use this discovery to target both the assembly and stability of the capsid, to either prevent the formation of the virus when it infects the host cell, or break it apart after it's formed," Luque said. "This could facilitate the characterization and identification of antiviral targets for viruses sharing the same icosahedral layout."
This new framework accommodates viruses that were previously outliers, provides new predictions of viral capsid architectures, and has identified common geometrical patterns among distant evolutionary related viruses that infect everyone from humans to bacteria.
Twarock said the new blueprints also provide "a new perspective on viral evolution, suggesting novel routes in which larger and more complex viruses may have evolved from simple ones at evolutionary timescales."
Architectural applications
The geometries could be also used in new architectural designs in buildings and construction.
Since the 1960s, these viral capsids have been classified using the geometrical framework introduced by structural biologist Donald Caspar and biophysicist Aaron Klug, which were inspired by the geodesic domes designed by the renowned architect R. Buckminster Fuller. However, as molecular imaging techniques have advanced, an increasing number of 3D viral capsid reconstructions that included viruses like Herpes or Zika have fallen out from this classical geometrical framework.
"This study introduces a more general framework than the classic Caspar-Klug construction. It is based on the conservation of the local vertices formed by the proteins that interact in the capsid," Luque explained. "This approach led to the discovery of six new types of icosahedral capsid layouts, while recovering the two classical layouts from Caspar-Klug based on Goldberg and geodesic polyhedra."
Priest who sexually abused boys in Wisconsin gets 30 years
A former priest accused of sexually assaulting young boys in Wisconsin decades ago has been sentenced to 30 years in prison.
The Wausau Daily Herald reports that 72-year-old Thomas Ericksen received the maximum sentence Thursday on two charges of sexually assaulting young boys while stationed at St. Peter's Catholic Church in Winter in the late 70s and early 80s. He must register as a sex offender for life.
Four men testified Thursday about how the assaults affected their lives. One of the victims went public for the first time.
Ericksen apologized to the victims in court and said he has come to realize the impact the assaults had on victims. At least 11 men claim they were abused by Ericksen during his time in the clergy.
Ericksen was removed from the priesthood in 1988.
Having Too Much Of This Spice Could Damage Liver
Made from the inner bark of the Cinnamomum tree, cinnamon is a widely popular spice, earning itself a place in a large variety of food and even becoming a flavor itself.
And all for good reason since the spice is host to some very impressive health benefits, such as lowering the risk of life-threatening diseases like heart disease, cancer and even diabetes.
But hold your horses just yet since too much of a good thing can be harmful, very harmful. And in this case, here are some side effects one can get if they eat too much cinnamon. Stay safe out there.
May increase the risk of cancer - Unfortunately, while cinnamon can help lower the risk of cancer, it can also very much contribute to the development of it. Per animal studies, consuming too much coumarin, which is commonly found in Cassia cinnamon, may increase the risk of cancer development. Per scientists, coumarin does this by supposedly damaging our DNAs over time.
May cause liver damage - Per studies, too much coumarin can also be responsible for liver toxicity and damage. This is according to several studies made on the effects of too much coumarin in our bodies.
May cause mouth sores - Not only does too much cinnamon help contribute to deadly conditions but they may also cause mouth sores. This is supposedly because cinnamon contains cinnamaldehyde, which is a compound that when ingested in large amounts, can cause an allergic reaction in our bodies. However, one can only get mouth sores from cinnamaldehyde when they're allergic from it.
May cause breathing problems - This is more of a general precaution since cinnamon's fine texture makes it very easy to inhale that may cause coughing and gagging as well as the cinnamaldehyde in it acting as a throat irritant.
May cause low blood sugar - For many people, cinnamon is helpful since it's well known for having the ability to lower our blood sugar. This is good, especially for those who suffer from high blood sugar. However, too many of it can make our blood sugar fall too low, posing a new set of health risks.
Tennessee's abortion waiting period trial goes to judge
A federal judge will have to decide which experts to believe in a trial over Tennessee's 48-hour waiting period law for abortions.
Over the course of a four-day trial in Nashville that concluded Thursday, the state tried to show that the law, which requires women to make two separate trips to a clinic at least 48 hours apart, benefits women by allowing them time to reflect on their decisions. Attorneys representing five of the state's seven abortion clinics argued the law provides no benefits and causes significant burdens.
Experts for both sides agreed that some women seeking abortions are uncertain, and some women who go through with an abortion later regret their decision. But they differed on whether those constituted a large or small percentage of the women seeking abortions. The experts also disagreed on whether Tennessee's 48-hour waiting period would make any difference for those women.
On Thursday, attorneys for the state introduced a study from Utah on the effects of a 72-hour waiting period there. It found that 8% of participating women who attended an initial counselling visit later said they were no longer seeking an abortion.
Questioned about the study, Antonia Biggs, a social psychologist researcher at the University of California San Francisco, agreed that some women change their minds about having an abortion or are uncertain to begin with. But she noted that the study did not find that Utah's mandatory waiting period caused women to change their minds or that it was otherwise beneficial to women.
Biggs also testified that there is no evidence that abortion causes women to have mental health problems. She said a national study comparing women seeking abortions who were just under the cutoff date to obtain them with a group of women who were over the cutoff and were turned away from clinics found no difference in the rates of issues like depression and post-traumatic stress.
Under cross-examination Biggs said the study did not follow the mental health outcomes of women in states with waiting periods who changed their minds about having an abortion, although there were only three women like that identified in the study. She rebutted testimony from earlier in the week by Priscilla Coleman, a psychology professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, who said that abortion is associated with mental health problems.
Coleman testified that she believes most of the scientific literature on abortion is politically biased in favor of abortions.
Thursday also included testimony for the state from a Memphis obstetrician and gynecologist who participates in a controversial network that attempts to halt the effects of abortion-inducing medication. Dr. Michael Podraza said that through that work he has "personal experience with women who have changed their minds about an abortion."
Tennessee's waiting period law went into effect in mid-2015, and Podraza said he has seen several women since then who wanted to try to reverse a medical abortion that was already underway. Some of those women then changed their minds a second time and followed through with the abortion, he testified. These reversals happened in spite of the waiting period.
Clinic directors previously testified the wait period causes women financial hardship and stress. They also said the two-visit requirement poses logistical challenges for patients and clinics that cause abortions to be delayed far beyond the 48 hours required by law, pushing some women into surgical abortions, which have greater risks of complications. A few women are pushed beyond the time when they can receive an abortion altogether.
Tennessee is one of 14 states with laws requiring women to make two trips to an abortion clinic according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.
In determining whether Tennessee's waiting period violates the U.S. Constitution, U.S. District Judge Bernard Freidman must determine whether it places an undue burden on women seeking abortion. It's a subjective standard that has caused some waiting period laws to be struck down and others upheld, depending on the specific circumstances of the state.
After both sides rested their cases on Thursday, Friedman said he would rule as quickly as possible.
French chemical fire extinguished as questions mount
French authorities and Normandy residents are clearing up residue from a huge fire at a chemical plant as a foul stench continues to spread over a swath of territory.
No one was injured in Thursday's fire at a lubricant plant in Rouen, but residents have expressed concern about possible health risks and consequences for the nearby Seine River.
The head of the regional administration said Friday the fire was extinguished Thursday night after nearly 24 hours. Firefighters are still on the scene.
The administration warned of a new odor released after the fire was put out, saying it could spread to neighboring regions.
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said people in fragile health should remain indoors through Friday night.
The cause of the fire is being investigated. The plant is among the highest-risk industrial sites in Europe.
LNG investments hit record in 2019 & the biggest growth is coming from China
Investments in liquefied natural gas since the start of the year have hit an all-time high of $50 billion, the International Energy Agency's head, Fatih Birol, told an industry conference.
"This year, 2019 already broke the highest amount of (final investment decisions) for the first time ever, $50 billion," Birol told the LNG Producer-Consumer conference in Tokyo, as quoted by Reuters.
Unsurprisingly, the driver of this growth in investments is growing demand for the fuel in Asia, with China still expected to overtake Japan as the world's top importer of LNG.
"The biggest growth is coming from China. In the next five years, about one-third of global LNG demand will come from China alone," Birol said. He added that in five years, China will become the largest importer of the fuel.
As for the growth in investments, there are no surprises there, either. The bulk of these has been made in the United States and Canada.
In a December 2018 report the Energy Information Administration said it expected the United States" LNG export capacity to double by the end of this year to 8.9 billion cu ft daily. This will make the US the third-largest exporter of LNG in terms of capacity after Qatar and Australia. By 2030, US LNG exports are estimated to reach 17 billion cu ft daily, from some 3 billion cu ft at the start of 2019.
In Canada, there is just one LNG project under development right now - LNG Canada - but it could have a final capacity of 28 million tons of the fuel annually. The US$31-billion project is led by Shell, with minority participants including Petronas, PetroChina, Mitsubishi, and Kogas.
Meanwhile, Qatar is stepping up its efforts to keep its number-one spot in the global LNG export race. The country has lifted a moratorium on new drilling in its North Field - the world's largest offshore gas field Qatar shares with Iran - aiming to boost export capacity by 43 percent to 11 million tons annually.
Global LNG demand is seen at 550 million tons by 2030, according to projections by IHS Markit.
Viola Davis Drops Some Truth Bombs About Playing Michelle Obama On 'Jimmy Kimmel'
Viola Davis is feeling the pressure of playing Michelle Obama.
"I'm terrified," the actor said on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" Thursday.
It was announced last month that Davis would star as the former first lady in Showtime's dramatized "First Ladies" anthology series. Davis said the script is great, but she's keenly aware of the burden to get her performance right.
"I don't care what else I've done in my life ― I won an Emmy, I won an Oscar, two Tonys ― but if I mess this up, this'll be the defining moment in my life," she told host Kimmel.
Davis said she's waiting for her publicist "to call and say, "Hold the line, it's Michelle Obama ― to cuss your ass out.""
Davis, in her sixth and final season of "How To Get Away With Murder," is also thinking of the audience.
"Listen, I don't want to make my people mad," she said.
Judge shows concern for violent teen's choice of drink on attack night
A judge sentencing a teenager for a violent attack on a love rival appeared to show just as much concern about his choice of drink in the lead up to it.
Kieran Clifton, 19, battered a 17-year-old he blamed for the end of his relationship with a former girlfriend.
Oxford Crown Court heard Clifton had been drinking mixers at the Fat Fox pub in Watlington, Oxfordshire, shortly before the assault in March last year.
Judge Nigel Daly told Clifton, who admitted ABH, that the alcohol had "played a significant part" in the night's violence.
But he remarked of Clifton's choice of tipple: "Drinking Coca Cola and Amaretto? I'm surprised you were not sick!"
Clifton, from Chalgrove, was handed a 12-month sentence, suspended for 12 months, ordered to complete a 15-day rehabilitation activity requirement along with 160 hours" unpaid work and pay £750 compensation.
'It sounds dorky, but it's really fun': inside the cosy world of bookstagram
A pink blanket goes with everything: Jane Austen classics, a queer young-adult romcom, fantasy novel Six of Crows. Jordan Hickey's version is crocheted, made by her grandmother, and appears in most photos on her Instagram account pagetravels, where it's paired with various books to evoke a sense of tantalizing coziness. Wouldn't you like to be here right now, her photos imply, cuddled up with this blanket and this mug of coffee, with nothing else on your to-do list aside from reading the new novel Frankly In Love, out today?
Hickey is a part of "bookstagram," the corner of Instagram combining a love of books with stylized, eye-catching photos, to the delight of large fanbases. The bookstagram tag has been used on over 35m Instagram posts, and the more popular bookstrammers have upwards of 100,000 followers (for comparison, the Instagram for the New York Times book section has about 69,000 followers.) There are enough people joining bookstagram that a slew of articles have cropped up, advising would-be bookstagrammers on best practice, how to manage Instagram's "pesky algorithm" and the best budget-friendly props. Some accounts focus on old books, or books by authors of color, many play with elaborate staging.
Leader of Colombia's Los Pelusos crime gang killed, president says
The top leader and founder of Colombia's Los Pelusos crime gang has been killed in an operation led by the national police, President Ivan Duque said on Friday.
The gang is one of the most well-known criminal organizations in the Andean country and involved in fighting that has endangered hundreds of thousands of people in areas along the eastern border with Venezuela.
Luis Antonio Quintero, known by his alias Pacora, was a former leftist rebel who commanded some 440 gang members, the government said.
The 49-year-old was wanted on terrorism and murder charges and located in Norte de Santander province on Thursday.
"It's clear we are going to completely break up this group," Duque said in a statement from the United States, where he traveled for the United Nations General Assembly this week.
Quintero was responsible for the killings of human rights activists and community leaders, the statement added.
Duque has faced criticism from some in the international community for not doing more to stop killings of activists from being committed with impunity across the country.
Another leader of Los Pelusos was captured in the operation, the statement added. It did not provide details about the circumstances of Quintero's death.
'How dare you?' Thunberg's U.N. speech inspires Dutch climate protesters
Thousands of Dutch children skipped school to join a global climate strike on Friday, blocking traffic and asking their leaders "how dare you?" in a reference to Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg's speech at the United Nations.

Turnout at the march in The Hague exceeded expectations with organizers estimating the crowd at about 35,000. Police were forced to reroute the march to a location with more space.
Thunberg, 16, gave an impassioned address at the United Nations in New York this week, after millions of people worldwide joined a climate strike protest last Friday in the run-up to a U.N. climate summit.
"This strike is going to have a lot of effect when people keep showing up, not just today but also in the future and we see different kinds of people from all walks of life," said protester Reinder Rustema.
Banging drums and holding pictures of Thunberg, protesters walked through the city center with placards reading: "For the Greta good," "Don't be a fossil fool," and "You will die of old age, we will die of climate change."
"I understand their concerns, I believe they are being heard," Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told journalists at a weekly press briefing within earshot of the protests. "We have presented very ambitious plans to deal with these problems. But we have to do it in a smart way, which also creates jobs."
Thunberg's brief address electrified the start of the summit aimed at mobilizing government and business to break international paralysis over carbon emissions, which hit record highs last year despite decades of warnings from scientists.
"This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?" she said, her voice quavering with emotion.
The Netherlands, with 17 million inhabitants, generated less than 7 percent of all energy from sustainable sources in 2017, compared to 15 percent in Germany and over half of all energy in Sweden.
The government has pledged to halve CO2 emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, but by 2017 had only achieved a 13 percent cut.
Thunberg was taking part in a protest in Canada on Friday where U.N. aviation leaders were gathering in Montreal to discuss plane emissions targets.
Military Sees Frustrating Trend As Suicides Spike
Military suicides surged this year to a record high among active duty troops, continuing a deadly trend that Pentagon officials say is frustrating and they are struggling to counter.
The Army, Navy and Marine Corps all saw the rate of suicides go up as well as the overall numbers, with only the Air Force showing a decrease, according to data released by the Pentagon Thursday. Suicides among members of the Reserves and the National Guard also grew.
The difficulties involved in identifying service members with possible problems and finding ways to prevent suicides were underscored earlier this month when the Navy reported that three crew members who served on the USS George H.W. Bush took their own lives within a week.
Asked about the deaths in the crew of the aircraft carrier, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said, "I wish I could tell you we have an answer to prevent further, future suicides in the Armed Services. We don't. We are caught up in what some call a national epidemic of suicide among our youth."
The number of suicides across the military increased from 511 in 2017 to 541 in 2018. According to the Pentagon, the most at-risk population is young enlisted men, and at least 60 percent of the time they chose a gun as their suicide method. Army suicides went from 114 to 139, while the Marines went from 43 to 58 and the Navy went from 65 to 68. The Air Force dipped from 63 to 60.
"Our numbers are not moving in the right direction," said Elizabeth Van Winkle, director of the Pentagon's office of force resiliency. She said that most of the military rates are comparable to civilians, but added, "that's hardly comforting."
Military and defense leaders expressed dismay and a resolve to do more to increase resilience in the force, train service members how to handle stress better and encourage troops to seek help when they need it. Van Winkle said the military is also looking at increasing efforts to train troops on the safe storage of firearms and medication. She said there are no consistent rules or regulations across the department and the services requiring gun locks or other controls on firearms, but that some states or bases have their own restrictions.
She and Karen Orvis, director of the suicide prevention office, said recognizing service members who may be struggling or at risk of taking their own lives is very difficult, and that sometimes suicide is a sudden, impulsive decision with little warning. They said it's difficult to identify reasons for suicide because there are so many stresses that could contribute.
They also acknowledged that service members are reluctant to come forward and seek help, because they worry that it could affect promotions or security clearances. And military leaders said they must all work harder to address those perceived roadblocks.
"Just as we talk about physical fitness, marksmanship, training and education, Marines must also be comfortable discussing life's struggles, mental wellness and suicide," said Gen. David Berger, commandant of the Marine Corps. "We must create a community where seeking help and assistance are simply normal, important decisions Marines and sailors make."
This year for the first time, the Pentagon included statistics for suicides by military spouses and dependents. Van Winkle said the most recent numbers available were for 2017, but officials are working to get better at collecting family data.
According to the report, there were 186 families that had suicides - 123 were spouses and 63 were dependents between the ages of 12 and 23.
The vast majority - nearly 70 percent - were female spouses under the age of 40, while 70 percent of the dependent suicides were males. About half of the dependents who died by suicide were at least 18 years old and, for those younger than that, most of the deaths were youth between 15 and 17.
Seth Meyers Loses It Laughing During Donald Trump 'Tango & Cash' Impression
"Late Night" host Seth Meyers on Thursday brought a moment of levity to an otherwise strained week marred by mass shootings when he cracked a gag about President Donald Trump and then couldn't stop laughing.
The comedian noted how Trump had visited the El Paso, Texas, hospital where victims of the weekend's mass shooting are being treated while his campaign still owed the city more than half a million dollars for a political rally in February.
The campaign also incurred a one-time late fee over its failure to pay on time.
"That's so him," said Meyers. "I'm surprised his Oval Office desk isn't covered in unreturned Blockbuster DVDs."
He then began mimicking Trump with a riff on hit 1989 movie "Tango & Cash," but soon descended into a fit of the giggles.
Man gets prison after woman finds bullet in her skull
A Georgia man has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for shooting his girlfriend, who didn't realize she survived a bullet to the brain until she went to the hospital for treatment of headaches.
News outlets report 39-year-old Jerrontae Cain was sentenced Thursday on charges including being a felon in possession of a gun in the 2017 attack on 42-year-old Nicole Gordon.
Suffering from severe headaches and memory loss, Gordon was examined last year by doctors who found a bullet lodged in her skull.
Gordon told police she didn't remember being shot, but did remember an argument with Cain during which her car window shattered and she passed out. She thought she was hurt by broken glass, and she was patched up at the home of Cain's mother.
This Model's Runway Stomp Has Eclipsed All Else At Paris Fashion Week
As Lady Gaga once sang in her 2008 hit "Bad Romance": "Walk, walk, fashion, baby."
One model took those words to heart and "murdered" the runway, according to one editor, while closing Maison Margiela's spring 2020 collection by John Galliano at Paris Fashion Week on Wednesday.
Model Leon Dame, 20, strutted down the catwalk like no one has strutted before, powerfully putting one foot in front of the other and stomping down the runway, while keeping an intense, steely glare intact.
His walk, paired with his belted top, white shorts, knee-high boots and cadet hat, quickly took the internet by storm. In one video of his walk, it appears he even got a smile out of Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour as he passed by her.
Many praised the young German model, who has appeared in campaigns for Jil Sander, Fay and Solid Homme, for his distinctive swagger.
Actor and "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" star Lisa Rinna described Leon as her "spirit animal," and fashion designer and singer Rihanna followed him on Instagram.
"This video and this exit take the cake," one fan wrote on Leon's page after the model posted a video of his walk. "Crushhh leon" another added, while makeup artist and mogul Pat McGrath ― who did the makeup for the show ― left him lightning and fire emojis.
Perhaps the highest praise came from Tim Blanks, editor-at-large of the fashion site The Business of Fashion.
"You're going out a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!" Blanks wrote in an Instagram caption on Wednesday, quoting the film "42nd Street."
He added, "@leondame MURDERED the catwalk @maisonmargiela. Guess it's true what they say. There ain't nothin" like a DAME!"
Geomagnetic Storm in the Last days of September
Geomagnetic disturbances are expected from September 27 to September 29, according to the US National Atmospheric and Oceanic Research Agency's Space Weather Forecast Center. Moderate geomagnetic storm (G2) is possible due to high-speed solar wind
The Russian Laboratory for Solar Activity Research at the Lebedev Institute predicts that the disturbance will start in the evening of September 27, and culminate in the next day from morning until noon. The planetary index can jump to 5 Kp level.
Geomagnetic storms can affect people with problems in the cardiovascular system. Doctors warn that some people may develop heart cramps, dizziness, headache and lack of concentration. Magnetic disturbances often affect people with mental disorders as well.
In case of more severe disturbances, there are also fluctuations in the electricity grid. Satellites providing navigation information are also vulnerable.
The beautiful side of such phenomena are the spectacular Northern Lights in the sky above the poles.
Sony, Disney Back To Work On Third Spider-Man Film
Looks like there will be a homecoming of sorts for Spider-Man, now that Disney and Sony have settled their differences.
The two studios announced on Friday that they will collaborate on a third Spider-Man film starring Tom Holland.
The as yet untitled film will be released on July 16, 2021, and be produced by the Disney-owned Marvel Studios and its president, Kevin Feige, according to a press release sent by both studios.
Amy Pascal will also produce through Pascal Pictures, as she has on the first two Holland-led films, the release said.
"I am thrilled that Spidey's journey in the MCU will continue, and I and all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working on it," Feige said in the release. "Spider-Man is a powerful icon and hero whose story crosses all ages and audiences around the globe."
The agreement also allows Spidey to appear in a future Marvel Studios film.
Feige acknowledged the collaboration makes the webslinger unique among superheroes.
"[Spider-Man] happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross cinematic universes, so as Sony continues to develop their own Spidey-verse you never know what surprises the future might hold," he said.
The end to the Spidey standoff came more than a month after it was reported the two studios were unable to reach terms on a deal for a sequel to their previous films, "Homecoming" and "Far From Home."
The sticking point was that Disney ― which owns the character ― reportedly wanted a co-financing stake in future films with Sony, which has the film rights thanks to deals set up before the Mouse bought Marvel in 2009.
The Hollywood Reporter notes both sides had good reason to come together. "Far From Home" is Sony's biggest box office hit ever, while Marvel gets to maximize merchandising and keep creative control.
One person who was happy the impasse has ended was Holland himself, who expressed his joy on Instagram.
EU, British negotiators work toward Brexit deal in Belgium
The European Union's chief Brexit negotiator began talks With British officials in Belgium Friday to work toward an agreement, with about a month remaining before the departure deadline.
Michel Barnier met with Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay in Brussels, who was adamant the Irish "backstop" be stripped from any deal. The backstop, effectively an assurance of a soft border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Britain leaves, has been perhaps the chief obstacle in negotiations.
While Barclay said Britain is committed to finding a deal, he said there isn't much time left.
"I think there is still a long way to go. I think we are coming to the moment of truth in these negotiations," he said.
The deadline to leave the EU is Oct. 31, but a new British law prevents Prime Minister Boris Johnson from completing the withdrawal without a trade agreement, or Parliament's approval to leave without one by Oct. 19.
Last week, EU negotiators said they are open to an alternative to the backstop -- but Irish deputy Simon Coveney said Friday London hasn't yet submitted a "serious" proposal.
"Until there is a serious proposal, which can be the basis of negotiations, then the gaps which are wide at the moment will remain," he said.
He added that "time is running out" and "the onus is on the British prime minister and his team" to put serious proposals on the table.
Johnson's office said Friday there are still "significant obstacles" to a deal.
"From an Irish perspective, we of course think that an extension is preferable to a no-deal," Coveney said. "But I think there would have to be good reason behind that to ask for an extension."
EU President Jean-Claude Juncker said he and Barnier are doing everything they can for a deal and if they fail, it's Britain's fault.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he's not optimistic about a deal, but urged British leaders to present a plan at a Brexit summit on Oct. 17.
"The withdrawal agreement is actually an international treaty," he said. "It's not the kind of thing that can be amended or cobbled together late at night."
Scientists puzzled by really big planet orbiting really little star
Scientists are expressing surprise after discovering a solar system 30 light-years away from Earth that defies current understanding about planet formation, with a large Jupiter-like planet orbiting a diminutive star known as a red dwarf.
An artistic impression of the gas giant planet GJ 3512b orbiting its red dwarf host star, released on September 26, 2019.
Stars generally are much bigger than even the largest planets that orbit them. But in this case, the star and the planet are not much different in size, the researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ 3512, is about 12% the size of our sun, while the planet that orbits it has a mass of at least about half of Jupiter, our solar system's largest planet.
"Yes, an absolute surprise," said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia at the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain, who led the research published in the journal Science.
"The discovery was surprising because theoretical formation models suggest that low-mass stars typically host small planets, similar to Earth or small Neptunes. In this case, we have found a gas giant planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star," Morales added.
The planet, which like Jupiter is composed mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain. It travels around its star in a very elliptical orbit lasting 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small, with relatively low surface temperatures. GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than our sun, it is somewhat comparable in size to a very large planet, being only about 35% bigger than Jupiter.
"They emit less energy, so they are fainter than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather cool, below 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit/3,527 Celsius) approximately. This is why the have a reddish color," Morales said.
There is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting the star, while a third planet might have been ejected from the star system in the past, explaining the elliptical orbit of the Jupiter-like planet, Morales said.
Planets are born from the same disk of interstellar gas and dust that produces the star around which they orbit. Under the leading model for planetary formation, called the "core accretion" model, an object initially forms from solid particles in the disk and the gravitational tug of this embryonic planet allows for an atmosphere to arise from the surrounding gas.
A competing model, called the gravitational instability model, may explain this unusual system.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than expected and cold," Morales said. "This makes the disk become unstable so some dense regions can appear. These clumps can grow until they collapse, forming a planet."
School strikers around the world march to demand action on climate
Children around the world launched another wave of school strikes demanding action on climate change Friday, in their first major action since the issue topped world leader's agenda at the United Nations this week.
The Fridays for Future movement that began as a lone demonstration by Swedish teen Greta Thunbergjust over a year ago has mushroomed, with millions of students taking to the streets of cities like New Yorkand attracting attention in developing nations across Africa.
Some of the first protests began in New Zealand, where Thunberg saidorganizers estimated 170,000 people marched across the country. There were also marches in cities in Italy, Finland, Nigeria, Austria and India, among other countries.
Friday's protest followed a week of climate talks at the United Nations in New York, which included a scathing speech by Thunbergto world leaders reprimanding them for inaction.
"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words," she said on Tuesday. "The eyes of all future generations are upon you and if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you."
Citing a U.N.-backed reportreleased last year, demonstrators are demanding governments implement measures to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2.7 degrees, which scientists warn result in dire consequences for human life and the planet.
Thunberg and the young people she has inspired say they will not stop their weekly classroom walkouts until they see a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change.
In Nigeria's capital Abuja, Oladosu Adenike marked her 46th consecutive strike on Friday. The activist posted images on Twitter of students dressed in blue school uniforms carrying banners with messages, "Climate change is real" and "We don't have time."
In Lausanne, Switzerland, where hundreds of climate strike organizers gatheredin August planning for this week's events, thousands of people marched through the city, according to local reports.
Thousands more were expected to take to the streets of Helsinki, Finland, where local media reportedthat the city's school would allow students to participate.
Thunberg, who remains in North America following her visit to the U.N., was scheduled to participate in climate strikes in Montreal, Canada.
Serena Williams Fined $10,000 For Allegedly Damaging Wimbledon Court
Serena Williams, tennis legend and seven-time Wimbledon champion, is being fined $10,000 for allegedly damaging the London practice courts with her racquet.
The All England Club, which hosts the Wimbledon tournament, handed the fine to Williams after she reportedly caused damage during a practice round on the outside courts on June 30, according to The Associated Press and CNN.
The 37-year-old tennis star appeared to shrug off the fine while speaking to reporters after winning the quarterfinal round against Alison Riske on Tuesday.
"I haven't really thought about it, to be honest," she said when asked about the fine. "I just threw my racquet. I got fined."
Williams said she didn't know how that could've caused damage.
"I mean, I guess if you could tell me, I would appreciate it," she told reporters. "I mean, I have always been an Avenger in my heart. Maybe I'm super strong. I don't know."
Williams is after her eighth Wimbledon title, which would be her 24th grand slam victory. She is advancing to the singles semifinals on Thursday against Czech player Barbora Strýcová.
Williams was also fined a total of $17,000 last year after she defended herself against an umpire at the U.S. Open who accused her of illegally communicating with her coach during a match.
During that incident, the umpire issued three code violations to Williams: One for receiving illegal coaching, a second for breaking her tennis racket in frustration and a third after she confronted the umpire and called him a "thief."
Many of Williams" fans claimed that the umpire was unnecessarily harsh in his response to her, especially considering male players" meltdowns throughout the history of the sport.
"Do you know how many other men do things that are much worse than that?" Williams told U.S. Open officials who entered the court during the match after her confrontation with the umpire.
Williams wasn't the only one who received a fine at this year's Wimbledon, though hers was the most costly.
Italian player Fabio Fognini was fined $3,000 for saying a "bomb should explode" at the tennis courts after he lost the third round to U.S. player Tennys Sandgren on Saturday.
Nick Kyrgios of Australia was hit with two fines ― one for $3,000 and a second for $5,000 ― for unsportsmanlike conduct.
The Who STOP concert last night: Friday and Sunday shows CANCELLED
Rock legends The Who are on a major US tour. In Houston, Texas, Roger Daltrey was forced to call off the concert less than halfway through. The 75-year-old told the disappointed audience: "I think I should quit while I'm ahead." The band had performed eight songs already but promised to try and return for another show one day in the future. Watch the video of how it all unfolded on stage.
After playing classic 1982 track Eminence Front, Daltrey called it quits. he has struggled with vocal issues and apparently is under strict instructions from his surgeon.
The British star told the crowd he couldn't go on with the show: "If I carry on trying to do what I'm doing for you, I'm going to damage myself. I think I should quit while I'm ahead... Last time, I ended up in hospital for a month and I'm not going there again. Sorry."
Pete Townshend explained what was going on to the audience: "It sounds like he cannot do any more, I'm afraid..."
The band left the stage, originally suggesting they would try to work out the rest of the set without Roger.
When he returned, Townsend said: "I'm really, really sorry. Roger cannot actually speak now.
"Apparently, before the show, he saw a doctor, and you know, he's been singing so f***ing great through this tour. I don't know what the f*** is going on. He has been on top of his game.
"I'm really sorry this has happened to you guys tonight... I don't think there is much point trying to put anything together that makes any sense because this is Roger's show and he's not in good shape."
The crowd was completely supportive, cheering the 74-year-old as he explained what had happened and how the band hoped to return to honour their commitment to the show.
Townsend said; "We will publish a date for our return as soon as we can. Let me explain one thing... We only do one day on, one day off. This is because Roger's vocal surgeon insists he has a day off...
"I swear to you we will come back and we will honour your tickets. I love you so much and I'm sorry to let you down."
Following the show, the upcoming Friday and Sunday night concerts in Dallas and Denver were cancelled.
Their next show is on October 9 in San Francisco. The band will open their UK tour in Manchester n March 16, 2020.
Michael Schumacher's Manager with a Statement about his Condition
An official statement was released regarding Michael Schumacher's health. The legend has been recovering for almost 6 years from injuries sustained after a skiing accident in the Alps in 2013, Gong.bg reported.
Weeks ago, worldwide media reported that the former pilot had been admitted for treatment at a hospital in Paris. Sabine Kehm, Schumi's long-time manager and longtime family friend of the Schumacher family, made the statement.
"Michael's health is not a public issue, so we will not comment on it, if only because we need to protect Michael's privacy as much as possible," Kehm stated. "We realise that this is difficult for some people to understand, but we do so in perfect accordance with Michael's attitude and can only thank you for being understanding,"
She also revealed that Schumacher is an extremely sensitive person. He did not like his name to be in the headlines and avoided public appearances even before the incident.
The manager urged not to believe in any photos that "leak" on social networks and in yellow magazines around the world.
Authorities Investigating Deadly Crash In Angeles National Forest, Body Found
Police were investigating a deadly crash in the Angeles National Forest Thursday afternoon.
According to police, a body was found inside of a vehicle just below the Angeles Forest Highway and Big Tujunga Canyon Road.
Initial reports from the scene said that the vehicle might have been there for some time.
It was not immediately clear how the vehicle was found.
Are hopes for a nuclear-free world realistic?
Seventy-four years ago, two nuclear bombs were detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing tens of thousands of people.
Since then, wherever conflict between major powers rises, so does the threat of a nuclear war.
Various treaties have attempted to suppress that threat, yet today there are nearly 14,000 nuclear weapons based around the world.
Thursday marks the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, but it's a goal that looks increasingly less likely.
So, is there the political will to abolish these weapons?
Meghan to 'fulfil her heart's desires' and refuses let own needs 'fade away' amid her royal duties
Meghan Markle is determined to 'fulfil her heart's desires' and not let her own needs 'fade away' now she's a member of the Royal Family - and wants to be a role model for young boys as well as girls.
The Duchess of Sussex, 38, reportedly made the remarks during an event for inspiring female entrepreneurs at Woodstock Exchange in Cape Town earlier this week during her tour of South Africa with husband Prince Harry.
Woodstock Exchange, the UK-SA Tech Hub, focuses on skills development and access to markets by assisting entrepreneurs, particularly women, to acquire skills, resources and support.
The Ladies Who Launch meeting saw the former actress, 38, meet with several women who have set up their own businesses in industries such as technology, conservation and fashion and praise them for 'empowering the next generation' of creative minds.
During a conversation with the female tech founders Meghan, who has campaigned vigorously for the empowerment of young women and girls, said she hopes to do the same for young men.
Mother-of-two Naadiya Moosajee, a South African engineer, social entrepreneur and co-founder of Women in Engineering, revealed: 'We acknowledged the importance of not just education for girls but being role models for boys - that we are women who are influential and who boys can look up to as well,' People reports.
'We both have sons, and we were bearing in mind that we are not just role models for girls but boys - and not just our sons, but generally in public too.'
She added that having Meghan present 'didn't feel hierarchical', as it was 'women gathered together and a talk about the struggles we have, as well as the things we need to do to move forward and grow and change our societies'.
Matsi Modise, founder of skills training company Simodisa, said Meghan is determined to continue to champion the issues close to her heart despite being a member of the Fold.
'She talked about being a mother and having duties as a duchess and fulfilling what her heart desires - and that it can't just fade away now that you're a duchess,' Modise recalled.
'That you have to be true to who you are.'
She said the duchess pushed them to plough ahead with their new ideas and spoke about how they have to keep pushing and going forward, knowing they are doing it for others who will follow.
'She wasn't referring to being a royal, but life in general when you have challenges,' Modise added, admitting she felt a bit 'awestruck' by Meghan.
'She radiates grace and she is taking this task that she has with such grace,' Modise said.
'A lot of us have done amazing things as founders, but meeting a royal is quite daunting. She made it easy. She is an easy-going royal.'
Meghan also revealed she's enjoying the pressures of being a working mother, admitting she finds juggling being a royal and looking after baby Archie 'a lot' but 'all so exciting'.
Speaking to mother-of-two Lara Rosmarin, CEO of Cape Innovation and Technology, Meghan said: 'We're only five months in right now. Being a working mum and travelling as well with a baby, my goodness it's a lot, but it's all so exciting.
'There are days when it's a lot to juggle but then you meet someone and you have an impact on them and you say "ah-ha," and it's so rewarding.'
Meghan then went to the city's Mothers2Mothers organisation, which trains and employs women with HIV.
She took along some of Archie's baby clothes, including a onesie saying 'The Future' and his Invictus babygro which he no longer fits, alongside donations from her friends with children.
Parents of 5-month-old stuffed in suitcase and tossed in dumpster get 6 years in prison
The parents of a 5½-month-old boy whose body was thrown in a dumpster were sentenced to six years in prison after pleading no contest Thursday to charges in the baby's death.
Adam Manson, 34, and Kiana Williams, 32, each pleaded no contest to one felony count of child abuse resulting in death and admitted to a special allegation that they caused the death of their son, Jacsun Manson, the Los Angeles County district attorney announced.
Manson and Williams had initially pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The two had been doing drugs in a South L.A. motel on New Year's Eve when they found the baby dead, prosecutors said. They placed his body in a suitcase and tossed it in a trash bin near the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, prosecutors said.
In late April, weeks after searching through the El Sobrante Landfill in Corona, authorities called off the search. The child's body was never found.
Police said in a statement at the time that they made the decision to end the search for Jacsun with a "heavy heart," but noted they couldn't pinpoint a location in the landfill "to a point that would make continuing the search reasonable."
UK's medical drug supply still uncertain in no-deal Brexit
Britain's government watchdog says there is still a "significant amount" of work to do to ensure the country has an adequate supply of medical drugs in case of a no-deal Brexit.
In a report issued Friday, Britain's National Audit Office said additional shipping capacity chartered by the U.K. for sending goods across the English Channel might not be operational until the end of November - one month after the Oct. 31 deadline for Britain to leave the European Union. Of the more than 12,300 medicines licensed in the U.K., about 7,000 arrive from or via the EU, mostly across the Channel.
According to the British government's "reasonable worst-case" scenario, the flow of goods could be cut by half on Day One of a no-deal Brexit and could take a year to recover. It said time was "extremely limited" if the shipping issues were to be resolved by the end of October.
The report also said there was "incomplete information" about the levels of medicine stockpiling but that levels were increasingly daily. As of Sept. 20, suppliers reported that 72% of medicines had a six-week stockpile.
"In the event of a no-deal exit, the department (of health) would be working in a highly uncertain environment and operating all the elements of its plan would be a hugely demanding task," the watchdog wrote.
Meg Hillier, who chairs a committee overseeing the audit office, called the findings "deeply concerning." She said she had seen "countless examples" of the British government missing deadlines, but that this one was particularly striking.
"If the government gets this wrong, it could have the gravest of consequences," she said.
Dr. Richard Torbett of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said that while companies have been working to prepare for Brexit, "some things are outside of their control."
He said more details were needed on how companies might access government-planned freight capacity if Britain sees a no-deal departure from the EU.
"Securing a (Brexit) deal remains the best way to protect patients," he said.
Cleveland police branded 'failing' in all areas by inspectors
Scandal-hit Cleveland police has become the first force to be branded "failing" in all areas by inspectors.
It has been rated inadequate overall and in three key areas by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS), which scrutinised its ability to reduce crime and keep people safe, operate efficiently, as well as the way it treats the public and its workforce.
The findings mean the force is effectively plunged into special measures, where the chief constable and police and crime commissioner are called before a national board and questioned about their plans to ensure "critical improvements" are made.
The home secretary could then step in to tackle the problem if no progress is made.
A string of scandals has plagued the force, covering Hartlepool, Redcar and Cleveland, Stockton and Middlesbrough in the north east of England.
It has seen six chief constables in almost as many years.
Former chief constable Sean Price was sacked for gross misconduct in 2012; seven officers were under investigation after journalists" phones were unlawfully monitored, and there have been long-standing claims of racism within the ranks.
Work practices were recently described by the chief inspector of constabulary as being about as "inefficient as you can possibly imagine," with officers having to share laptops and bodyworn cameras.
HM Inspector of Constabulary Phil Gormley said it was a "failing force" where there had been "significant" deterioration in the last two years.
Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen said the report described the "worst findings ever into any police force in the country" which was "finally the official validation" that the force is "broken" and said the Home Office needed to intervene now.
He added: "It's no longer in dispute. It is a fact described in black and white in this report.
"The findings are some of the most distressing and shocking I have ever read."
Cleveland is one of 15 forces that has been recently inspected by HMICFRS inspectors, and the only one rated inadequate in all areas.
Gormley added: "The force doesn't appropriately prioritise crime prevention. There is a lack of strategic direction, and the force doesn't allocate enough resources to prevention work ... It is failing to respond appropriately to vulnerable people, including children. It is missing opportunities to safeguard them and exposing them to risk."
He said senior leaders were not consistently demonstrating "ethical behaviour," and the "inappropriate behaviour of senior leaders within Cleveland is so profound that it is affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the force."
He added: "It doesn't consistently treat its workforce with fairness and respect and it doesn't effectively communicate with or engage its workforce; its processes aren't perceived to be fair and it doesn't understand its workforce well enough to support them."
Despite the findings, the force did receive a small amount of praise for the way it tackles serious and organised crime but was told it must improve the way it investigates crimes.
The force's police and crime commissioner Barry Coppinger said: "I am deeply concerned at the worrying contents of this report.
"The force's recent performance is simply not good enough."
He said he had received assurances from the current chief constable Richard Lewis that "swift action" was taken as soon as he became aware of the failings.
Coppinger has been ordered by the Home Office to respond to the report within 56 days.
Lewis said the report would act "as a line in the sand" for the force, adding: "Improvements have already been made and I take full responsibility for driving through the changes that are so obviously needed. In the five months I've been here I have met some exceptional police officers and staff, at all levels, and have seen lives saved and vulnerable people protected by the efforts and determination of frontline officers."
If drastic improvements are not made quickly enough, the Government could step in, as it can when prisons are failing.
But so far politicians have never had to resort to this measure with police forces, inspectors said.
Kit Malthouse, minister for crime, policing and fire, said he welcomed the chief constable's "swift action to address these failings and will be monitoring the position closely," adding: "Transparency and accountability are vital for public trust in policing.
Immanuel Christian School: Sixth-grade boys accused of pinning down black girl and cutting off her dreadlocks in Virginia
A black middle school student from Virginia is accusing three white boys of pinning her down and cutting off her dreadlocks. The incident took place at Immanuel Christian School - where Vice President Mike Pence's wife, Karen Pence, is a teacher.
Amari Allen, a 12-year-old student at the private K-12 Christian school, said the boys called her dreadlocks "ugly" and "nappy" before cutting them off on the playground during recess.
"They kept laughing and calling me names," Amari told CBS affiliate WUSA-TV, tearing up. "They called me 'ugly,' said, 'I shouldn't have been born.' They called me 'an attention-seeker.'"
According to WUSA, one of the boys allegedly covered Amari's mouth while another held her hands behind her back and a third took a pair of scissors to her dreadlocks.
Amari didn't tell her family about the incident until after her grandmother noticed the length of her hair had changed.
"They ran off laughing, and I was just sitting there," Amari said.
The alleged incident occurred on Monday, but the shy preteen said she didn't tell her family about it until Wednesday, after her grandmother noticed her hair looked different. She feared retaliation if she confessed the truth, she said.
"It's very painful," said Cynthia Allen, Amari's grandmother. "I want to see them dismissed from the school. I want to see something done."
Allen's family pays nearly $12,000 per year for Amari to attend the school, which made headlines earlier this year after Karen Pence took an art teaching job at the famously anti-LGBTQ institution.
"We take seriously the emotional and physical well-being of all our students, and have a zero-tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse," Immanuel Christian School said in a statement. "We are deeply disturbed by the allegations being made, and are in communication with the family of the alleged victim to gather information and provide whatever support we can. We have also reached out to law enforcement to ask them to conduct a thorough investigation, and further inquiries should be directed to the Fairfax County Police."
While the school has a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, Amari said the boys had previously tormented her. She said that the boys have taken her lunch and called her names in the past.
Amari's family met with school officials Thursday, and the investigation is ongoing.
Iran releases British oil tanker Stena Impero
Iran released a British-flagged oil tanker on Friday, two months after it captured the vessel for allegedly entering its waters in violation of international law.
Iranian Ports and Maritime Administration confirmed that the vessel, Stena Impero, left Bandar Abbas port at 9 a.m., the state-run IRNA reported.
Erik Hanell, president and CEO of Stena Bulk, the operator of the ship, also confirmed the ship's release.
"Stena Bulk and Northern Marine Management confirm the Stena Impero and its crew have been released," he said via Twitter.
The ship was captured by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps on July 19 for having violated international maritime law when it allegedly veered into Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz.
The vessel's seizure, however, was widely seen as retaliatory for British forces capturing a tanker off Gibraltar on suspicion of transporting Persian oil to Syria in violation of international sanctions. The ship was released in mid-August despite the Trump administration making a last-ditch attempt to length its detention.
The Stena Impero was officially given permission to leave on Monday but was kept in port until a probe into the ship's conduct completed, the New York Times reported.
"The vessel has left the port of Bandar Abbas and is transiting to Dubai for the crew to disembark and receive medical checks and debriefing," Hanell said. "The families of crew members have been informed and the Company is currently making arrangements for the repatriation of its valued seafarers at the earliest possible opportunity."
The ship became victim to escalating tensions near the Persian Gulf where both the United States and Iran shot down the other's drone and at least two tankers were sabotaged by explosives, which the Trump administration has blamed Iran for.
The Trump administration most recently blamed Iran for drone attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, which Tehran denies having any involvement with.
PM Modi Tweets Tribute To Jacques Chirac, Calls Him True Global Statesman, Friend Of India
Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the death of former French president Jacques Chirac, saying India mourns the loss of a true global statesman and friend.
Jacques Chirac, who supported India after it conducted nuclear tests in 1998, died on Thursday at age 86. He served as the president of France from 1995 to 2007.
"My deepest condolences on passing away of Jacques Chirac. India mourns the loss of a true global statesman. A friend of India, he played a decisive role in establishing and building India-France Strategic Partnership," Prime Minister Modi tweeted.
India and France have a strategic partnership, initiated in January 1998 during Jacques Chirac's first visit to India. He again visited the country as president in 2006.
Jacques Chirac was known to have been suffering from ill health for a long time.
Uganda: Government Launches Oral HIV Self-Test Kit
Ministry of Health has launched an oral HIV self-test kit aimed at empowering citizens, especially men to carry out HIV testing.
The initiative is aimed at reducing new HIV/Aids infections by 2020.
The oral HIV test kit dubbed, OraQuick HIV self-test, a product of Orasure technologies, targets young people aged 18 to 24 years, men and priority populations such as sex workers.
"Currently we are targeting young people 18 to 24 years. For the young people that's the age bracket we are looking at but of course any one above 18 and it's because we do not have evidence of children by the Constitution but as more evidence unfolds we are going to get there. For the men, we give the kit to the mother and they take it to the partner, key and priority populations such sex workers," Mr Geoffrey Tasi, the technical officer-in-charge of HIV testing services, said yesterday.
Easy use
Initially, the self-test kits available involve the use of blood to detect the HIV, however, with oral HIV self-test kit, oral fluids are involved.
The test works by detecting antibodies, the body's natural defenders against infection. If one is infected with HIV, these antibodies will be present in your blood and also in the salivia. The test will detect the antibodies in the mouth.
Data by the Uganda Aids Commission (UAC) shows that Uganda is registering 1,000 new HIV/Aids infections and 500 deaths from the viral disease per week, translating into 53,000 new infections and 23,000 deaths annually.
Dr Diana Atwine, the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health, said this is timely and will enhance the fight against HIV/Aids.
She, however, urged the men to take HIV testing as an important issue.
She added that there is still effort to reach the 14 per cent of the people, who are living with HIV but do not know their HIV status.
"Currently, 86 per cent people living with HIV know their status; that means it leave us with 14 per cent of those living with HIV and do not know their status. So how do we now utilise that additional innovation. Really for me this is it ... how do we now move from this kit and create demand, especially for that 14 per cent that are sick and they need care and they are not getting care," Dr Atwine said.
However, health officials warn one should not eat or drink within 15 minutes before starting the test.
Mr Tasi said studies conducted showed no suicide cases and the ministry is confident that the potential of harm can be avoided because the test is voluntary.
Dr Atwine said apart from graphics and videos provided to educate the users, there should be toll free numbers always available to offer counselling in both government and private facilities, including all pharmacies.
Research. According to the research, OraQuick HIV self-test detected more than 99 per cent of people, who were infected with HIV and people, who were not infected with HIV.
Athletes feeling the heat at Qatar world championships
Some competitors at the world athletics championships that began on Friday have already encountered their most challenging opponent: the sweltering Qatari heat.
With its suffocating humidity and daytime temperatures hovering around 38 degrees Celsius, Doha weather has been widely discussed among athletes and athletics officials and seen as a cause for concern in some events.
Those competing on the road in the marathon and walking races will begin their events in the middle of the night to minimize the heat's harmful effects.
Although the heat is less of a threat to the athletes competing inside the Khalifa International Stadium, where temperatures are kept at around 21 degrees with the help of a cooling system, they have still had to adjust their training because they practise at an outdoor facility.
"We are from a hot climate as well, but nothing to compare with this," Bahamian coach Ronald Cartwright told Reuters.
"Here you walk outside and it's like somebody put a heater on you. I guess that is why they are doing it at night."
Athletics officials have pledged additional medical and safety measures for marathon runners and race walkers.
The IAAF, the global governing body of athletics, said the women's marathon, scheduled to start at midnight on Friday, would go ahead as planned as temperatures would be at or below 30 degrees.
It said its medical delegate had assured athletes that weather conditions would be monitored all day and reported to the teams "to ensure the event is run at an acceptable level of health risk."
Track athletes competing inside the stadium said it was unlikely that the heat would significantly affect their performances, but conceded that practices have been especially draining.
"At practice I'm glowing because I'm sweating because it's so humid," said Rai Benjamin, who competes in the 400m hurdles.
"It's like I got out of the shower. But I don't think it will be that bad because of the cooling system."
Shot putter Ryan Crouser, the 2016 Olympic champion, said he has had to heat up his shots to around 38 degrees Celsius to prevent them from becoming wet during practices in the sizzling heat and high humidity.
"The shot is far below the dew point, the instant you take it out, it's just soaking wet and it's dripping water," the American said. "It's worse than if it was pouring down rain... We've been fighting this a little bit."
European pole vault champion Armand Duplantis, who trains in the heat of the southern U.S. state of Louisiana, said the humidity can prove helpful in practice because the addition of moisture to the chalk on his hands "makes for a really nice grip."
But other pole vaulters who spray a sticky grip enhancer on their hands might have more difficulty holding onto their poles in the humidity, he said.
"For people who use sticky spray, I can see it being a problem because it can get a little slimy and gooey," Duplantis said.
Fears of security breach at major prison as locksmith is arrested
A prison locksmith has been arrested amid fears keys to a jail's cells have been copied resulting in taxpayers footing a £500,000 bill to replace all its locks.
HMP Wandsworth called in police amid fears that duplicates had been sold to some of its 1,400 inmates.
The suspected security breach will result in 3,000 locks replaced, potentially to cell, internal and outer doors.
Police arrested a 40-year-old man at the jail on suspicion of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office on September 13. The man, from South West London, was working for the Government Facility Services Ltd, which maintains 52 jails across the south of the country.
The police investigation has raised concerns that imprints of some of the keys may have been taken in clay before actual copies were produced.
However, prison bosses stressed that they had not found any evidence that inmates had obtained any keys.
Wandsworth Prison is a Category B jail in South West London which can house up to 1,628 prisoners, making it one of the largest prisons in Western Europe. The jail, built in 1851, holds convicted male criminals and those on remand awaiting trial.
A Prison Service spokeswoman said: "HMP Wandsworth has increased security at the gate and is operating extra identity checks as a result of a security incident. It would be inappropriate to comment further while a police investigation is ongoing."
House chairmen warn Trump to stop attacking whistleblower
"The President's comments today constitute reprehensible witness intimidation and an attempt to obstruct Congress' impeachment inquiry. We condemn the President's attacks, and we invite our Republican counterparts to do the same because Congress must do all it can to protect this whistleblower, and all whistleblowers," they said. "Threats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security."
The statement said Trump "is fully aware that our Committees are seeking testimony from this whistleblower and others referenced in the whistleblower's complaint released today as part of the House's impeachment inquiry, and our nation's laws prohibit efforts to discourage, intimidate, or otherwise pressure a witness not to provide testimony to Congress."
"No officials with knowledge relevant to the committees' investigation, including knowledge of the subject of the whistleblower complaint, may be subject to any intimidation, reprisal, or threat of reprisal, and all witnesses must be made available for congressional testimony," they added.
The statement on Thursday comes amidst an explosive week in Washington rooted in a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump abused his official powers "to solicit interference" from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the upcoming 2020 election, and the White House took steps to cover it up. A transcript of July phone conversation released by the White House on Wednesday shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.
Even before the whistleblower complaint was made available to lawmakers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday declared Trump had betrayed his oath of office and announced she was opening a formal impeachment inquiry into the President.
Michelle Obama Calls Meghan Markle 'An Inspiration' In Adoring Instagram
Michelle Obama gave high praise to Meghan Markle in a sweet Instagram on Thursday, calling the Duchess of Sussex "a thoughtful leader who is breaking the mold and making our world better for it."
The duchess and Prince Harry, now on a 10-day royal tour of South Africa with their baby son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a youth reception earlier this week and met Obama Foundation leaders.
"Thank you to my friend, Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex @sussexroyal, a thoughtful leader who is breaking the mold and making our world better for it," the former first lady wrote in her glowing post.
"Whether meeting with our @ObamaFoundation Leaders or helping girls around the world seek the education they deserve, she is an inspiration to so many," Obama added, alongside a photo of a smiling Meghan posing with foundation leaders.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September issue of British Vogue, which the former "Suits" actress guest-edited. In their candid chat, the former first lady reflected on motherhood and how it's changed her.
"Being a mother has been a masterclass in letting go," Obama said in the interview.
"Motherhood has taught me that, most of the time, my job is to give them the space to explore and develop into the people they want to be. Not who I want them to be or who I wish I was at that age, but who they are, deep inside."
Obama, who knows first-hand the pressure of being under a global spotlight, doled out some advice to the duchess in an interview with Good Housekeeping.
"The pressure you feel ― from yourself and from others ― can sometimes feel like a lot," she said. "So my biggest piece of advice would be to take some time and don't be in a hurry to do anything."
She continued:
I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughters, making sure they were off to a good start at school and making new friends before I launched into any more ambitious work. I think it's okay - it's good, even - to do that.
Moment hero police officer rushes onto busy motorway to save dog hit by car
This is the heroic moment a police officer ran out onto a busy motorway to rescue an injured dog.
Footage from Joseph Puglia's dashcam shows him jumping out of his police car within seconds of seeing the dog get hit by another vehicle.
The officer, who works in Pinellas Park, Florida, wrapped the wounded pup in an emergency blanket, placed him in his SUV rushed to the nearest animal hospital.
"My heart really sank until I started seeing him breathing," Mr Puglia told ABC news.
Thankfully, the dog survived with just minor cuts and bruises.
"We nicknamed him "Lucky" and I think the name applies," the officer said. "He's definitely one lucky dog."
The dog was brought to a local animal shelter and his rescuer has since been hailed as a hero.
But Mr Puglia insists he was just doing his job.
The officer added that if animal services cannot find the owner, some of his family members would be more than willing to give Lucky a home.
After WeWork debacle, IPO market slams brakes on unprofitable companies
BOSTON (Reuters) - Companies making their debut on the U.S. stock market are getting a rough welcome, especially if they are losing money, casting a shadow over the calendar for initial public offerings for the rest of the year.
The surprise postponement of the WeWork IPO has underscored how confidence is eroding in the market both for companies looking to raise capital and investors.
A more discerning market for initial public offerings continued to punish Peloton Interactive Inc PTON.O on Friday, a day after it began trading, as shares of the fitness startup fell 4% to $24.74. The company is now trading 15% below its Wednesday IPO price.
In the past, public market investors have typically expected companies to become profitable within 18 months or so of an IPO. This timeline has been relaxed with money managers eager to add businesses with fast-growing revenue to their portfolios.
Recent deals, however, suggest an uncertain economic outlook is pushing investors to be more selective about the loss-making companies they are willing to back.
Peloton reported rapid top-line growth of 110% during the fiscal year that ended June 30. But the company also showed negative operating leverage, with operating expenses surging 147% over the prior year.
Loss-making teeth-alignment company SmileDirectClub SDC.O earlier this month became the first U.S. IPO in three years to price above its target range and close down on its first trading day, according to research firm Renaissance Capital.
The average IPO return in 2019 is now about 9%, down from more than 30% at the end of June and more than 18% about two weeks ago.
In the United States, much of the attention in the third quarter has focused on a deal that failed to come to fruition - the planned IPO of WeWork parent We Company.
Having aimed to launch its IPO earlier in September, the company postponed plans to list until later in 2019, before replacing its chief executive officer and saying it was reviewing its timetable to go public.
Endeavor Group Holdings (EDR.N), an entertainment and talent agency company backed by Hollywood power broker Ari Emanuel with a track record of losses, made a last-minute decision to abandon its IPO due to the tough market conditions. Taking a lesson from the struggles earlier in 2019 of ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies (UBER.N) and Lyft Inc (LYFT.O), which have no stated timetable for becoming profitable, investors have started to push back on companies with a history of steep losses. "It will be a dialogue among bankers and boards and senior management teams where they say, "these were isolated and not comparable," or say "we have a sentiment shift and we need to be more conservative and use a different strategy,"" said David Ethridge, U.S. IPO services leader at audit firm PwC. The market was more receptive to lesser-known names such as cyber security company Ping Identity PING.N and cloud monitoring company Datadog Inc DDOG.O. Both companies have reported more modest losses and rely on selling to companies rather than to consumers.
Jonathan Van Ness Just Hung Out With Nancy Pelosi And They've Got A Plan
"Queer Eye" star Jonathan Van Ness strutted his stuff on Capitol Hill on Thursday, joining forces with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to discuss the Equality Act.
The Equality Act would extend nondiscrimination protections to LGBTQ individuals in credit, education, employment, housing, federal financial assistance, jury service and public accommodations.
The bill would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of already protected classes.
Van Ness, who recently publicly came out as HIV positive, first shared a video of himself cat-walking in the Capitol, explaining in his caption that he'd met with the House speaker to talk Equality Act, living with HIV and access to PrEP (an HIV preventative medication):
He then shared a longer post picturing the two of them arm in arm, urging his followers to stand up to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and apply pressure to GOP senators to bring the Equality Act up for a Senate vote:
Pelosi introduced the Equality Act on March 13. The House passed the legislation in May. It has not yet been brought to the Senate floor.
In August, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to essentially legalize anti-gay discrimination in the workplace, arguing in an amicus brief that the federal laws on employer discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were not intended to protect individuals from being fired based on their sexual orientation.
Pelosi met earlier this year with Van Ness and three of his "Queer Eye" co-stars as well as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), to talk policy and promote the bill.
On Thursday, Pelosi shared her own image of herself and Van Ness warmly holding hands on a balcony, thanking him for bringing his voice to the fight:
David Attenborough working on new documentary about animals and colour
David Attenborough is 93-years-old but the iconic nature guru is not slowing down just yet.
No, after the success of his groundbreaking Netflix documentary Our Planet, the much loved star is set to return with another series: Life In Colour.
This time, the father-of-two will look at how animals use colour in their lives through high-tech cameras that were built especially for the programme.
The BBC have revealed that the star aims to show "a world of colour normally invisible to human eyes" - and it sounds truly fascinating.
However, despite fans being eager for the upcoming release, it seems we all need to sit tight as it won't be dropping on our screens until 2021.
But we're sure it'll be worth the wait.
Earlier this month, David was presented with the TV Choice Lifetime Achievement Award, at the prestigious ceremony in London.
The national treasure has entertained millions over his career, which has so far spanned 60 years.
When collecting his gong, the reporter enthused: "Indeed. What I do isn't always entertaining, and sometimes people hear things they don't like!
"But this is an honour and a great pleasure."
TV Choice said of the winner: "Still working, learning and making programmes Sir David Attenborough isn't just a British hero, he's a global icon."
This week, David was celebrated once again as a polar research ship was named after him.
The star joined both Prince William and Kate for the naming ceremony in Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
He said: "It's no news to any of you that the world is facing great, great problems and the most aware of that are the young people of today, who will inherit this world.
"Great problems require great research and facts in order to solve them.
"That's what this astonishing ship will be here to do, to find out the facts and find the science with which to deal with problems that are facing the world today and will increasingly do so tomorrow."
Life In Colour is expected to air on BBC Two in 2021, while it's said Netflix will retain global rights.
Don't use my wife's name to score points, says husband of murdered MP Jo Cox
The husband of Jo Cox said his wife's name must not be used to score political points after Jeremy Corbyn last night posted footage of the murdered MP to criticise Boris Johnson.
The Labour leader's film featured clips of Mrs Cox and a vigil held after her death, with the caption: "Boris Johnson does not care about violence on our streets."
Critics said Mr Corbyn was using her murder to score "cheap political points" while her husband Brendan Cox said the Labour leader was "wrong" to infer hateful language was a "simple party political issue."
Mr Cox said: "Jeremy is right that the best way to honour Jo is to defeat hatred and division. He's also right the PM has a particular responsibility.
"But he's wrong to infer this is a simple party political issue. Jo was passionately Labour but some things must transcend party politics."
He also shared a post which said Jo Cox's name was "more than a political scoring point" with the caption "This. Thank you." Mr Corbyn was facing a backlash for his video which opens with him talking about Mrs Cox's murder three years ago by a far-Right activist in her West Yorkshire constituency.
Speaking over a montage of clips of Mrs Cox, Mr Johnson and female MPs, Mr Corbyn said: "This Prime Minister knows these words can promote violence and have real consequences. He wants division. Clearly, he doesn't care about the violence on our streets."
He goes on to criticise Mr Johnson and call for a Labour government.
Mr Corbyn added: "Many are deeply concerned about the language used by Boris Johnson, language which is being repeated by the far-Right. When this was raised with him by women MPs, who themselves face death threats, he arrogantly dismissed them. It was nothing short of disgraceful." Former Labour MP John Woodcock shared the video and said: "You can really shut up. Disgusting."
Meanwhile Tory MP and business minister Nadhim Zahawi said: "You are so wrong to use Jo Cox in this way, when her family have specifically asked for her not to be used in this way. To be kept out of politics.
"If you have an ounce of decency Jeremy Corbyn you would take this video down." It follows a row over language in Parliament this week in which Mr Johnson said that the "best way" to honour Mrs Cox was to "get Brexit done." Her sister Kim Leadbeater called for a dialling down of extreme language saying it was "not helpful to Jo's kids."
She told ITV: "For me to come out and say outrageous things about Boris Johnson - I just don't think that's a useful way of moving forward. I can say what I think is right and what I think is wrong but I'm going to try and do that in a measured manner."
The daughter of Labour MP Yvette Cooper spoke out yesterday to say she constantly fears for her mother's life because of the way people speak about politicians.
House rebukes Trump on border wall, but he plans veto
The Democratic-controlled House is making a second attempt to overturn President Donald Trump's use of emergency powers to raid military base projects such as schools and target ranges to pay for his long-promised border fence.
The 236-174 vote sent the legislation to Trump, who is sure to veto it just as he killed a similar measure in March.
The Senate passed the measure last week with about a dozen veteran Republican lawmakers rebuking Trump.
Friday's vote was different because it followed the recent release by the administration of a list of 127 military construction projects totaling $3.6 billion that will be canceled to pay for the border wall, including numerous projects in GOP districts and states.
Brazil says oil in spill along northeast beaches not Brazilian
Brazil's environmental agency Ibama said on Thursday that an analysis of a vast oil spill along the country's northeastern beaches showed the spilled crude did not originate in the country.
Ibama said in a statement that it had been investigating the spill in several beaches in some northeastern states since Sept. 2. Local media showed pictures of sea turtles coated in black tar by the slick.
The spill spans over 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) of Brazil's northeast coast, affecting wildlife and polluting some of the postcard beaches in one of the nation's top touristic destinations, such as Praia do Futuro, in the state of Ceara, and Maragogi, in Alagoas state.
Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA said in a statement that it had concluded after a molecular analysis of the oil that the crude spilled was not produced nor sold by the company.
Crude oil is tested before export to make sure it complies with the standards of the refinery it is being shipped to. Crude oil from different fields can be identified according to a series of chemical signatures, including levels of sulfur and nitrogen, acidity and viscosity.
The head of Brazil's oil agency ANP Decio Oddone said the agency believes the oil could have been spilled by a tanker transporting the crude far from the Brazilian coast, but added this possibility has not yet been confirmed yet. An ANP statement said there were no reports of spills by any operator of oil drilling rigs in the country.
Some marine turtles were contaminated by the oil. They were rescued alive in the state of Rio Grande do Norte and sent to rehabilitation centers. Other animals were found dead, Ibama said, without disclosing species or numbers.
Petrobras, as the state oil company is known, said in a statement that even though it was not involved in the spill it was contributing to the clean-up efforts, with some 100 Petrobras employees helping clean the beaches.
Skoda to provide drivers with voice activated digital assistant
Skoda is to introduce a digital assistant that can be activated with a verbal command. In an announcement Wednesday, the Czech car maker said the digital assistant could be activated by the phrase "Okay, Laura."
The system, which supports six languages, is able to undertake a range of tasks including starting navigation to a destination and searching for music. It will initially be available in models of the Kamiq city SUV and the compact Scala. Part of the Volkswagen Group since 1991, the Skoda brand delivered 1.25 million vehicles globally in 2018, according to its annual report.
The company's introduction of a virtual, voice activated assistant mirrors efforts by other manufacturers in the sector. Some BMW cars, for instance, are now equipped with an "intelligent personal assistant" which can be activated by using a button, a personal activation word or the phrase "Hello, BMW." Verbal commands can be used to, among other things, activate seat heating, get information on tire pressure, and adjust the in-car temperature.
"Voice is the ideal interaction tool in the vehicle," Jack Palmer, a senior connected car specialist at SBD Automotive, said in a statement sent to CNBC via email on Thursday.
"If the lion's share of commands from the driver can be inputted through virtual assistants, rather than fiddling around with touchscreens and buttons, the current epidemic of driver distraction will be greatly mitigated," Palmer added. "Automakers have realized this and the race is on for them to integrate their own solutions or partner with consumer electronics companies such as Google and Amazon."
The moves by firms such as Skoda and BMW point to a potential shift in the way people interact with their cars. Hannah Keshishian, an automotive analyst at market intelligence firm Mintel, told CNBC via email that one of its recent reports had highlighted how nearly 40% of U.S. consumers who owned a vehicle "would like to use a digital personal assistant in their vehicle." This, she added, "opens the door to greater possibilities for digital assistant vehicle connectivity."
Ghana: World Rabies Day Observed
The 13th World Rabies Day was marked in Accra on Wednesday with a call on pet owners to vaccinate their dogs in order to safeguard the lives of the citizenry.
The programme which was held under the theme "Rabies: Vaccinate to eliminate" was organised by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture Veterinary Service.
It was aimed at highlighting the essential role of mass canine vaccination in rabies elimination in the country.
Addressing the conference, the Assistant Director General and FAO Representative to Ghana, Mr Abebe Haile-Gabriel indicated that the issue of rabies could be minimised if efforts were geared towards vaccination and keeping stray animals away from humans especially children.
According to him, the 'Zero by 30' Global Strategic Plan "of the 500,000 people who died from rabies each year, 40 per cent are children living in Asia and Africa," and called for holistic approach to deal with the situation to save kids from rabies.
Mr Haile-Gabriel stated that most stray animals carried rabies and re-echoed the need for the country to supplement the United against Rabies 2030 strategy that requires the pet owners to vaccinate animals that carried zoonotic diseases.
He underscored the need for the country to embark on five-year campaign and vaccination programme to create awareness to eliminate potential exposure of human to rabies.
A comprehensive roadmap for progressive elimination of rabies, he noted had been rolled out through the Ghana Rabies and Prevention Action Plan (2018-2030) to end epidemics of neglected tropical diseases by 2030.
Mr Haile-Gabriel pledged the readiness of the FAO to collaborate with other stakeholders in preventing and controlling rabies in the country.
Dr Owen Kaluwa, the World Health Organisation (WHO) Representative to Ghana observed that rabies was an endemic which had to be controlled to save lives.
He explained that through the "Zero human rabies deaths by 2030" strategy, countries were supported to develop and implement their national rabies elimination plans that embrace the One Health Concept and cross sectoral collaboration.
Dr Kaluwa noted that 99 per cent of zoonotic disease like rabies was transmitted from dogs to humans, adding that One Health approach to controlling and ultimately eliminating human rabies was expedient.
Director of Veterinary Service, Dr Asiedu Baah lamented that rabies had become global burden.
"Though rabies has no cure, the infection is vaccine preventable, hence its elimination is feasible therefore any animal owner must ensure their animals are vaccinated," he stated.
Dr Baah said although rabies was fully preventable using appropriate sustainable control strategies, lack of funds and concerted efforts had continued to result in escalation of human death and the spread of the endemic.
"It is imperative that the animal sector is adequately resourced to prevent transmission of rabies in dogs as a protective measure against the disease," he added.
The 12-year-old who "silenced the world"
Greta Thunberg has established herself as the planet's spokeswoman on climate change at the tender age of 16. But long before social media, another teenager was scolding UN leaders on the world stage 27 years ago.
In the year since she organized school walkouts in her native Sweden to protest climate change, Greta Thunberg's environmental crusade has been unavoidable, culminating on Monday in an angry and passionate speech before the UN's Climate Action Summit, in which she lambasted politicians for stealing her "dreams" and her "childhood" with "empty words" while humanity stares down "a mass extinction."
Thunberg's grim pronouncements have earned her savage criticism, and glowing praise. New York Magazine called her "the Joan of Arc of climate change," while The Guardian ranked her speech alongside President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address for its historical significance.
Then again, they said the same about Severn Cullis-Suzuki in 1992. Long before Thunberg deadpanned to parliamentarians that "we probably don't even have a future any more," and netizens tore each other to shreds attacking and defending her, 12-year-old Cullis-Suzuki became known as the "The girl who silenced the world for five minutes" when she delivered a similar sermon before the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
The tone of Cullis-Suzuki's speech is strikingly similar to Thunberg's. "We've come...to tell you adults that you must change your ways," she opened, just like Thunberg told the assembled adults "we will not let you get away with this."
Just as Thunberg told the UN summit "we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is the money and fairytales of eternal economic growth," Cullis-Suzuki told leaders that "losing my future is not like losing an election or a few points on the stock market."
And underpinning both girls" messages was a nihilistic fatalism. "I am afraid to go out in the sun now because of the hole in our ozone. I am afraid to breathe the air because I don't know what chemicals are in it," Cullis-Suzuki said in 1992. Striking schoolchildren in 2019 carry banners reading "You'll die of old age, I'll die of climate change."
The environmental problems addressed by Cullis-Suzuki reflect the world of the early 1990s, when deforestation, the depletion of the ozone layer, and the extinction of species were the ecological concerns de jour. Yet humanity has been fairly successful at resolving those problems in the intervening years. Thanks to a landmark chemicals ban, ozone depletion has slowed dramatically, and forest cover worldwide has increased by an area the size of Texas and Alaska combined.
Cullis-Suzuki herself went on to found an environmental think tank and work for UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's Special Advisory Panel in the early 2000s.
So what does the future have in store for Thunberg? Well that depends how you look at Cullis-Suzuki's example. On one hand, none of her worst fears came to pass. On the other, world governments still have ecological problems to contend with, and are still being lectured by children about them.
Assuming the world as we know it still exists 27 years from now - as Thunberg says it won't unless we slash carbon emissions to absolute zero in the next decade or so - then the teenage activist will likely look back on a long UN and NGO career that kicked off with one famous speech.
By then, another concerned child will likely be delivering a passionate warning about acid rain in the Martian colonies.
SNP could support Jeremy Corbyn as temporary PM to stop no-deal Brexit
The SNP has signalled it could support installing Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street on a temporary basis to thwart a no-deal Brexit.
As tensions between MPs and Downing Street deepened, Nicola Sturgeon suggested it could row in behind the Labour leader as a caretaker prime minister until a general election.
Mr Corbyn called on rebel Tories and opposition MPs to back him to lead a temporary administration in August - but the move was met with resistance, particularly from the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson.
Under the proposals, opposition parties would seek to oust Boris Johnson in a vote of no confidence and then form a unity government that would seek an extension to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU on 31 October.
The plan failed to gain cross-party support at the time, but senior figures in the SNP are concerned that Mr Johnson could defy a law forcing him to delay Brexit if there is no deal in place before 19 October.
Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, suggested that Mr Corbyn could be brought in to secure the extension as leaving Mr Johnson in charge would be a "terrible idea."
Responding to a tweet suggesting installing the Labour leader or another temporary prime minister, she said: "Agree with this.
"Vote of no confidence, opposition unites around someone for sole purpose of securing an extension, and then immediate general election.
"Nothing is risk free but leaving Johnson in post to force through no deal - or even a bad deal - seems like a terrible idea to me."
Veteran MPs Harriet Harman and Ken Clarke have both been named as potential figures to lead a unity government but a senior SNP source insisted it had to be the Labour leader.
"It is increasingly clear that we will have to install a new prime minister via a vote of no confidence, so that we can request a delay to Brexit and hold an election," the source told ITV's Robert Peston.
"Trying to find a compromise candidate, a national unity candidate, is too complicated, especially in the time we have. Whether people like it or not, the temporary prime minister has to be Corbyn."
An SNP spokesperson said the party was committed to stopping a no-deal Brexit and removing "this dangerous and undemocratic prime minister as soon as possible."
The spokesperson said: "It is now possible - if the political will is there - that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of Boris Johnson and his cronies, who are determined to find a way to get around the Benn Act, but is instead sent by a temporary caretaker prime minister, who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter, with an election held immediately afterwards.
"We remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a no-deal Brexit and getting rid of Boris Johnson."
Even with SNP support, it would come down to a knife-edge vote for Mr Corbyn. There are 288 Tory MPs, as well as 10 Democratic Unionists, so the opposition would need some of the 34 independent MPs to come on board.
Labour argued that the plan was the "simplest and most democratic way to stop no deal."
However the Liberal Democrats believe a temporary government led by Mr Corbyn cannot achieve the necessary support across the House, as he would need the backing of ex-Tory MPs and defectors from his own party.
Kirstene Hair, Tory MP for Angus, said: "This report confirms what many have long suspected - SNP MPs will happily prop up Jeremy Corbyn in No10.
"There is no doubt that Corbyn's weak stance on indyref2 is a deciding factor for the nationalists.
"He has already left the door open for a re-run of the 2014 referendum if he becomes prime minister.
"Only a Conservative government will stand up for those who voted "No" in what was meant to be a once in a generation event."
Over 50 Surrey University students banned from sports teams amid accusations of sexual harassment
"People are just doing everything you would expect from a lads holiday. It is accepted that this is an alcohol heavy, raucous trip."
However, students said that this year behaviour of some students went too far, particularly during a game which involved members of the football club being dared by their teammates to make advances on women, while their friends attempt to "intercept" them.
Alan Sutherland, chief executive of Surrey's student unions said: "We became aware of the misconduct, and as investigations proceeded any individual students who were accused of committing a "major" offence as per the student disciplinary regulations were referred to a university investigation."
Three students were formally disciplined by the university, which launched its own investigation into the football team's conduct.
One student was expelled for three counts of sexual misconduct or harassment, and one count of aggressive behaviour.
Meanwhile two other students, who were also accused of harassment, were issued with final warnings and made to issue apologies.
One was banned from University premises at certain times and the other was banned from attending organised social events. All three students were banned from attending their graduation ceremonies.
The Surrey University men's football club said that they "sincerely apologise" for its members actions during the Croatia tour.
Matt de Grood shouldn't be punished because of schizophrenia stigma
In 2016, Matthew de Grood, the man who killed five people at a house party in Calgary, was found to be not criminally responsible for his actions.
Now, in 2019, there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms, such as unsupervised outings. The decision won't come for a few more weeks, so in the meantime we're left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea. There are two sides to this: one citing his violent behaviour in the past, calling to prevent it from happening again, and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation.
First, let's examine the more pessimistic side. De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break. It was a violent and unpredictable attack. He suffers from schizophrenia, which is why he was found not criminally responsible, but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication. His psychiatrist, Dr. Santoch Rai, has said in front of the review board that "if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence, it would be severe." Despite his perceived improvement, there is still risk of re-offense. But is this reason enough to remain afraid? Is it enough to keep de Grood locked up?
As long as de Grood continues to take his medication, there isn't a huge risk of reoffense, so why are people so concerned? I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness, particularly those with schizophrenia, largely influences this fear. Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized, such as mood and anxiety disorders. But others, including schizophrenia, remain highly stigmatized. This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people.
That was the case in this situation, but these instances are rare, and that's perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur. In fact, the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent, and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence. In light of this, it seems unreasonable to insist that de Grood be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re-offense is based more on a prejudiced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood.
I don't believe de Grood should ever be unsupervised permanently. A parole-like system where he has to check in to make sure he's still taking his medication could work well. Arguing that he or other mentally ill people remain institutionalized unless absolutely necessary is a form of segregation. It perpetuates the idea that mentally ill people, those with schizophrenia in particular, cannot ever mesh with society; thus continuing the stigma and perpetuating the idea that they are dangerous criminals. He was found not criminally responsible by a court of law, so why should he be treated like a prisoner instead of someone who was ill and is now better?
Hungarian PM Orban defends his candidate for EU executive, "has solutions in pocket"
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said he has several solutions "in his pocket" after Hungary's candidate for the European Commission was rejected.
The EU transport commissioner-designate, Romanian socialist politician Rovana Plumb, and the proposed commissioner for EU enlargement, former Hungarian justice minister Laszlo Trocsanyi, were told their confirmation hearings could not go ahead because of inconsistencies in their financial statements, Reuters reported.
"I am convinced that [Trocsanyi] is the most suitable candidate for becoming member of the European Commission," Orban said. "His sin was that he helped the government and me... to protect Hungary from migration."
The move is seen as an embarrassment for Orban, who proposed Trocsanyi, and who has been in constant conflict with Brussels over his migration policy and other issues.
Babies on a plane: Japan Airlines unveils tool to tackle horror of screaming infants
Being stuck on a long-haul flight within earshot of a crying baby could be a thing of the past for passengers on Japan Airlines (JAL), after the carrier unveiled an online booking tool that indicates where toddlers will be seated.
When passengers with children aged between eight days and two years old reserve their seat, a child icon automatically appears on the seat plan, alerting other passengers who have yet to select their seats.
JAL was quick to point out that the new feature did not guarantee that passengers would be out of earshot of a screaming infant.
The icon would not appear if passengers booked their flight through a third party or were part of a tour group, or if there was a last-minute change of aircraft, the airline's website said.
JAL and other airlines have yet to come up with way of anticipating seat reservations by serial snorers and passengers who fully recline their seats during in-flight meals.
But the move attracted praise from some social media users.
"Thank you, @JAL_Official_jp for warnings me about where babies plan to scream and yell during a 13 hour trip," Rahat Ahmed, a businessman, tweeted. "This really ought to be mandatory across the board."
Others, though, castigated travellers for intolerance towards fellow passengers.
"They are babies, as we all once were. We need to learn tolerance or will soon start needing a map of seat locations for mouth breathers, droolers, farters, drunks, and perhaps a lot more things in life," one user said.
Pompeo accuses Syria of using chemical weapons in May attack
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday, said the United States has concluded the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year.
Pompeo said U.S. officials had determined Syrian President Bashar Assad's government had used chlorine in the attack on opposition forces in Idlib province on May 19.
"The Assad regime is responsible for innumerable atrocities some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity," Pompeo told a news conference.
U.S. officials in May said they'd received reports consistent with a chemical attack in northwest Syria but did not offer a definitive conclusion at the time.
In April 2018, the U.S., Britain and France launched airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month.
"This is different in some sense because it was chlorine... but know that President Trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons," Pompeo said.
He added that the U.S. would provide an additional $4.5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to fund investigations into other instances of suspected Syrian chemical-weapons use.
Pompeo also called on the Assad government to release thousands of unjustly detained prisoners, including American journalist Austin Tice, who has been missing and presumed held by the government for seven years.
"He is just one of a number of American citizens held in Syria and we call upon the Syrian regime to release them all."
Tesla jumps on report Musk aims to deliver 100,000 cars this quarter
Elon Musk, co-founder and chief executive officer of Tesla Motors.
Shares of Tesla jumped more than 5% after Electrek, an electric vehicle news website, reported that CEO Elon Musk said the company "has a shot" at delivering 100,000 cars this quarter, which would be a new record.
Electrek attributed the update to a leaked email from Musk sent to his employees at Tesla. Musk wrote in the email: "We have a shot at achieving our first 100,000 vehicle delivery quarter, which is an incredibly exciting milestone for our company!"
The CEO also reportedly added, "The challenge is making sure that we have the right car variants in the right locations and rallying as much as our company resources as possible to help with the end of the quarter deliveries."
The automaker is expected to report its quarterly vehicle deliveries in the next few days.
Last quarter, Tesla delivered approximately 95,000 electric vehicles.
Greece: 5 deny poor women's babies sold in illegal adoptions
Five Greek and Georgian citizens have appeared in court on charges of belonging to a criminal organization that allegedly sold babies for adoption.
All five denied the charges before a Thessaloniki magistrate on Friday. The two Georgian nationals are accused of being the ringleaders.
The gang allegedly recruited pregnant Bulgarian women who were destitute and willing to give up newborns they might deliver. Authorities say the group sold babies to childless Greek couples.
A total 12 people were arrested this week in connection with the alleged illegal adoptions and the alleged sale of human eggs. Another 54 have been charged with complicity.
Police say it was one of the biggest and best-organized gangs of its kind in Europe. The continent's Europol police agency assisted the investigation.
Mike Pompeo says Syrian government used chlorine in May chemical weapon attack
Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, said on Thursday that the United States had concluded the Syrian government had used chlorine as a chemical weapon in an attack in May during a battle with insurgents in Idlib.
"The Assad regime is responsible for innumerable atrocities, some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity," Mr Pompeo told a news conference in New York, where he has been attending the United Nations General Assembly.
"Today I am announcing that the United States has concluded that the Assad regime used chlorine as a chemical weapon on May 19," Mr Pompeo added.
The United States said in May it had received numerous reports that appeared consistent with chemical exposure after an attack by the forces of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, in northwestern Syria, but it had made no definitive conclusion as to whether they used chemical weapons.
The Trump administration has twice bombed Syria over Assad's suspected use of chemical weapons, in April 2017 and April 2018.
Father Remains Hopeful That Suspect Who Fatally Shot Son One Year Ago Will Be Caught
It's been one year since a 20-year-old from Long Beach was fatally shot, but the victim's family isn't giving up hope that the shooter will be caught.
"I wish I could trade places with you son, I wish I could trade places with you," Guy Alford, the victim's father, said.
Alford came back to the scene of the crime exactly one year after his son, Guy Alford III, was gunned down at a Jack In The Box near 52nd and Atlantic. He said he wanted to call attention to his son's unsolved murder.
"Somebody knows something, they need to say something," he said.
Security video, which has never been released, showed Alford stopped in the drive-thru when a second car pulled up behind him. Three suspects were then seen getting out of that car. One of them walked up to the driver's side, and shot Alford. The four people in Alford's car jumped out and ran. The suspects were then seen getting back into their car and driving away.
"Wherever this coward is, he will get caught," Alford said.
This grieving father said he has no idea who would want to hurt his son, and he said he still didn't know who was in the car with him when he was shot.
"They upped and ran out of my son's car like that, where did you run to," Alford said. "Did you go back and try to help him or what? Nobody said nothing."
Alford said his son was a star football player at Alemany High School, then a stand-out safety on the Long Beach City College football team. Alford said his son was working toward playing for a Division 1 school and had dreams of becoming a nurse.
"He was working three jobs," Michael Harvey, a friend, said. "As somebody who's 21, he was a year younger than me, anybody with that type of hustle and work ethic, you tend to look up to."
As the investigation into the fatal shooting continues, Alford said he wasn't giving up either.
"I can assure you, this one is going to get solved," he said.
Alford is personally offering a $2,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction. Anyone with information about this crime is urged to call Long Beach police.
Brexit can get plenty more toxic from here
Humiliation in the courts at home is a taste of what awaits Johnson in Brussels if he tries to weasel out of his commitments to request an extension. That will comfort European officials, who would most probably agree to it. Mainly because taking more time to find a solution reduces the threat of a no-deal Brexit, which would be economically harmful to both sides.
Yet European diplomats can also see that the political bedlam in the UK lends itself to delay without decisions. Lawmakers in Parliament were able to set aside their differences to tie Johnson's hands and seek an extension, but that's about all they can agree on. This is the same Parliament that rejected the former prime minister Theresa May's hard-fought Brexit deal with the EU three times. Unless there's an election - another decision on which MPs have a final say - that won't change.
But even an election is a grim prospect for European capitals hoping for a friendly resolution to the Brexit mess. The opposition Labour Party's Brexit policy is a painful contortion act that's almost impossible to understand; the centrist Liberal Democrats' idea to cancel Brexit altogether is seen as extreme. The longer this drags on, the more it eats away at the smooth functioning of the EU.
There might be more optimism in Brussels if the outline of a workable deal was already sitting on a desk somewhere in the European Commission's Berlaymont headquarters. But there isn't.
Johnson's regular bashing of his predecessor's "backstop" proposal to avoid a return to a hard border in Ireland and protect the EU single market hasn't led to any convincing alternatives. Officials say the proposals sent in by the UK on alternative arrangements aren't concrete enough to be considered operational in time for an October 31 exit.
And Johnson's weakness will give the 27 leaders facing him even less incentive to erase crucial red lines, despite the claim by Michael Gove, the UK minister in charge of a no-deal Brexit, that they're "shifting" on the backstop.
In an ideal world, a series of blows landing on Johnson - who is also under fire over his rhetoric in the debate over Brexit - would bring the match closer to an end. Europe should still try to extract maximum concessions from the UK, given it has no choice but to negotiate with the current government while trying to preserve unity among the rest of its 27 member states - which is going to get harder the longer this drags on. If there's a window to try yet again to put a deal before the UK parliament, the EU should grab it.
But this is more like a soccer match with 27 players on one side lining up to defend while the player in the opposite team tries to pick up the ball and go home.
The EU is good at setting rules and red lines and sticking to them; it's less good at unilaterally imposing its will. The UK is hemmed in by its own internal contradictions, at least until an election or a second referendum breaks the impasse.
Brexit can get plenty more toxic from here.
Black hole swallowing and ripping apart star captured for first time
A gigantic black hole has been captured pulling in and ripping apart a star for the first time.
The star, which was about the same size as our sun, was seen from 375 million light years away warping and spiralling into the gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole, researchers said in the Astrophysical Journal.
It was then sucked into oblivion in a rare cosmic occurrence astronomers call a tidal disruption event.
NASA's planet-searching telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite - TESS - captured the detailed timeline from beginning to end for the first time.
Astronomers used a worldwide network of telescopes to detect the phenomenon before looking at TESS, whose permanent viewing zones designed to find distant planets, caught the beginning of the violent event.
Thomas Holoien, an astronomer for the Carnegie Institution for Science who led the research, said: "This was really a combination of both being good and being lucky, and sometimes that's what you need to push the science forward."
Stars get sucked in when they venture too close to a supermassive black hole, which lives at the centre of most galaxies, including the Earth's Milky Way.
The black hole's impressive gravitational forces tear the star apart, with some of its material thrown into space and the rest into the black hole, forming a disc of hot, bright gas as it is swallowed.
Mr Holoien added: "Specifically, we are able to measure the rate at which it gets brighter after it starts brightening, and we also observed a drop in its temperature and brightness that is unique."
UK business committee to probe Thomas Cook collapse
The UK's Civil Aviation Authority said today that 72 flights are scheduled to operate to bring back a further 16,000 people to the country following the collapse of travel group Thomas Cook.
The aviation regulator said it has brought back over 40% of the total number of passengers in the largest peacetime repatriation 'Operation Matterhorn' launched on Monday.
Meanwhile, the British parliament's business committee has launched an inquiry into the collapse of Thomas Cook and will seek to question the management over issues such as executive pay and accounting practices.
Thomas Cook, the world's oldest tour operator, collapsed in the early hours of Monday, hitting hotel owners, tourist sites and resorts around the world.
"The main players in the sad demise of Britain's oldest travel firm should face public scrutiny and be held to account for their actions before the company collapsed," said Rachel Reeves, Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee.
Evidence hearings will begin in mid-to-late October.
"Directors will welcome the opportunity to set the record straight and demonstrate that their conduct was always in the best interests of Thomas Cook's customers, employees and stakeholders," a person familiar with the company told Reuters.
Why The Times Published Details of the Whistle-Blower's Identity
On Thursday, The Times published exclusive details about the identity of the whistle-blower whose claims led Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry against President Trump this week. (The article reported that the whistle-blower is a C.I.A. officer who was previously detailed to work at the White House and had expertise on Ukraine.)
Many readers, including some who work in national security and intelligence, have criticized The Times's decision to publish the details, saying it potentially put the person's life in danger and may have a chilling effect on would-be whistle-blowers.
We took their concerns to Dean Baquet, The Times's executive editor, who responded to them in a discussion with the Reader Center:
The president and some of his supporters have attacked the credibility of the whistle-blower, who has presented information that has touched off a landmark impeachment proceeding. The president himself has called the whistle-blower's account a "political hack job."
We decided to publish limited information about the whistle-blower - including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House - because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible.
China Says It Didn't Fight Any War Nor Invaded Foreign Land
China on Friday said it has not provoked a "single war or conflict" or "invaded a single square" of foreign land, skirting any reference to the 1962 war with India.
"China has always been dedicated to resolving territorial and maritime delimitation disputes through negotiation and consultation," stated an official white paper released, four days ahead of the country set to celebrate its 70th anniversary of the leadership of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) on October 1.
"China safeguards world peace through real actions. Over the past 70 years, China has not provoked a single war or conflict, nor invaded a single square of foreign land," the paper titled "China and the World in the New Era" said.
The white paper, while highlighting the CPS's "peaceful rise" made no reference of the bloody 1962 war with India and the vast tracts of land, especially in the Aksai Chin area, occupied by China.
The Sino-India border dispute involving 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) remained unresolved. China also claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet, which India contests.
So far, the two countries held 21 rounds of Special Representatives talks to resolve the border dispute.
Besides the 1962 war, India and China had a major military standoff at Doklam in 2017 when the People's Liberation Army (PLA) tried to lay a road close to India"s narrow Chicken Neck corridor connecting with the North-Eastern states in an area also claimed by Bhutan.
It was finally diplomatically resolved after which both sides pulled back their troops.
China also had a major military conflict with Vietnam in 1979. China claims sovereignty over all of South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims.
"China has achieved full resolution of land border delimitation problems with 12 of its 14 neighbouring countries, and delineated the China-Vietnam maritime boundary in the Beibu Gulf," the white paper said, noting that since reform and opening up in 1978, the country has cut its armed forces "by over four million."
The two-million strong Chinese military still remain the world's largest.
Prolonged monsoon brings floods and chaos to many parts of India
India's monsoon season has overrun by almost a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing deaths from collapsing buildings and many crops beginning to rot.
Normally the monsoon in north India recedes by the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month has been 37% above normal. If the situation continues for the remaining few days, it will be the latest the monsoon has ever receded in decades, according to experts in the India Meteorological Department.
Many areas of the country are still getting unprecedented rain, the latest being the town of Pune in western India, where torrential rain on Wednesday and Thursday caused several deaths and havoc from collapsed buildings.
Homes were flooded and people waded through streets with water up to their knees in scenes normally seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad have also experienced heavy rainfall. Uttarakhand state in the north has seen extensive damage to homes from the prolonged rains.
The monsoon was also late to arrive. Many areas suffered water shortages and farmers braced themselves for a possible drought.
The extended monsoon is not welcome among farmers. "This amount of rain is not normal at this time of the year. It is making my vegetables - I've got cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes at the moment - rot," said Prakash Mehra, a small farmer in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the impact of the delayed and now late-receding monsoon has meant a rise in the price in the price of onions, an essential ingredient in Indian food. Onions are selling at 80 rupees (about £1) a kilo in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, as opposed to the normal 20 rupees (23p).
Festivals are also at risk. The next big festival is Dussehra on 8 October, when Hindus erect giant, comic book-style effigies of Ravana, a figure from the Hindu epic The Ramayana who sports a bushy moustache and an evil grin.
Burning Ravana symbolises the triumph of good over evil. But given that the effigies are made of paper, if the monsoon continues, Ravana might have the last laugh.
Julian Assange: Private security firm 'spied on WikiLeaks founder in Ecuadorian embassy for CIA'
A Spanish private security company hired to protect the Ecuadorian embassy in London when Julian Assange lived there spied on the WikiLeaks founder for the US intelligence service, it has been claimed.
A report in Spanish newspaper El Pais said the company, UC Global SL, allegedly handed over audio and video to the CIA of meetings Assange held with his lawyers.
The company is being investigated over the claims by Spain's High Court, the Audiencia Nacional, said the report.
Assange filed a criminal complaint himself, in which he accused the company of violating his privacy and the secrecy of his client-attorney privileges.
El Pais said UC Global SL had failed to respond to requests for comment on the claims.
In April, Assange was dragged out of the embassy after being handed over to the British authorities by Ecuador.
He took refuge there in 2012 while on bail and facing extradition to Sweden over sex assault allegations, saying he feared extradition to the US if he left over the activities of WikiLeaks.
The US formally requested his extradition in June on 18 charges, including computer misuse and the unauthorised disclosure of national defence information.
He is accused of working with former US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.
He is now in Belmarsh prison in London after being jailed for violating bail conditions imposed over the Swedish extradition request and was due to be released last week, but was remanded in custody pending a hearing of the US extradition case in London in February 2020.
In May, Swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation into an allegation of rape against Assange - an allegation he has always denied.
Omni Air flight lands in Baltimore after declaring emergency
The Federal Aviation Administration says an Omni Air International jet landed safely at Baltimore Washington International Airport after declaring an emergency.
The FAA said in an email that Flight 328 landed at BWI at 6:19 p.m. on Thursday because of what was described as a hydraulic problem with the Boeing B777.
According to the FAA, the flight departed from Baltimore, but its destination wasn't known. It's unclear how many people were on board. The agency is investigating the incident.
A telephone message left at Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Omni Air International was immediately returned Thursday night.
Why we still need Gandhi
The leaders of the world's two largest democracies need to heed the principles of a remarkable man whose 150th birthday we are currently celebrating.
Mohandas Karamchand "Mahatma" Gandhi, who was born on Oct. 2, 1869, left a worldwide legacy with his focus on ethics, nonviolence, tolerance and social justice. He had a profound impact on two of the most important mass mobilizations in the United States.
The influence of Gandhi on the civil rights movement actually started well before the Rev. Martin Luther King's embrace of his ideals, with African-American activists such as Howard Thurman and Benjamin Mays undertaking long sea voyages to India to meet Gandhi.
And Cesar Chavez, who modeled many of his tactics on Gandhi's in leading the farmworkers" movement, traced his political awakening to a newsreel he watched at the age of 11 or 12 showing that "this half-naked man without a gun had conquered the might of the British Empire."
Outside the United States, Gandhi had a similar effect. Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Nobel Peace Prize-winner Malala Yousafzai and climate change activists, to give just a few examples, have acknowledged Gandhi as a guiding light.
But President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who triumphantly addressed a joint mega-rally in Houston recently, seem to be impervious to Gandhi's ideas, despite paying lip service to him at the event. Both are right-wing populists who have ruled with scant compassion or tolerance, successfully mobilizing whites and Hindus in their respective countries as voting blocs, and fomenting division and social antagonism.
Modi has belonged, since he was 8 years old, to a Hindu nationalist organization known as the RSS, an ex-member of which, Nathuram Godse, assassinated Gandhi on Jan. 30, 1948. Indeed, parliamentarians from Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party have heaped praise on Gandhi's killer in recent years.
The Modi government's un-Gandhian approach has manifested itself on many fronts. It has stripped the Muslim-majority province of Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy and statehood and put it into lockdown. It has proven unwelcoming to the mostly Muslim Rohingya refugees who have fled from extreme persecution in Myanmar.
And Modi's government has created an uproar by instituting a national registry of citizens and setting up detention camps in the border state of Assam to ostensibly catch noncitizens from neighboring Muslim-majority Bangladesh, a step that may end up disenfranchising and imprisoning almost 2 million people.
Trump is singing from a similar songbook. His administration's Muslim-majority travel ban echoes the Islamophobia that often informs Modi's policymaking. Its callousness toward refugees mirrors the Indian government's disdain for the Rohingya population's suffering, and its detention camps parallel the ones the Modi regime is setting up. Trump's stirring of racial animosity is analogous to troublesome rhetoric from a number of Modi's cabinet members.
There was a teachable moment for the two leaders at their recent joint rally. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer at the event quoted Gandhi's definition of democracy as "something that gives the weak the same chance as the strong."
Trump and Modi would do very well to keep Gandhi's advice in mind, 150 years after his birth.
Trump nominates Peter Gaynor to be FEMA chief: White House
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Acting Administrator Peter Gaynor smiles as he testifies before a Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing on FEMA's FY2020 budget request on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 3, 2019.
U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor on Thursday to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the White House said in a statement.
Gaynor, FEMA's deputy administrator, had been acting chief of the agency, which oversees the government response to disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.
The agency has been without a Senate-confirmed administrator since March, when Brock Long left the post. Long resigned after the Department of Homeland Security, under which FEMA falls, concluded Long had inappropriately used government vehicles to commute between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
A different nominee for the job, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn from consideration earlier this month, after a background check uncovered allegations that he had been involved in a barroom brawl.
Gaynor's nomination to the post was expected. He will require a majority of the Senate to approve the nomination to take the job.
Before becoming FEMA's deputy administrator in 2018, Gaynor worked in emergency management in Rhode Island and was a Marine, the White House said.
Man set alight on doorstep 'in targeted attack'
A man has been set alight on his doorstep in what police believe is a targeted attack.
The 48-year-old was soaked in flammable liquid, believed to be petrol, before bursting into flames outside his home in Skelmersdale, West Lancashire.
He is in hospital in a critical but stable condition after suffering serious burns.
Police have launched an attempted murder inquiry after they were called to the man's house at about 1am on Thursday.
Detective Chief Inspector Pauline Stables, leading the investigation, said: "This is a horrific incident which has left a man in a very poorly condition in hospital.
"We are carrying out a number of enquiries to try to identify those responsible.
"While we are trying to establish a motive for what has happened, we do believe that the incident was targeted and I would like to stress that I don't believe there is any threat to the wider community at this time.
"Someone out there knows who has done this and I would urge them to come forward and speak to us.
"Has a loved one come home acting suspiciously, smelling of smoke or petrol or with unexplained injuries?
"We need to find the people responsible for this dreadful crime."
Vulnerable Dems air impeachment concerns to Pelosi
During the meeting, several members made clear their stance that Democrats should keep the inquiry focused on the Ukraine matter -- allegations that Trump asked the Ukrainian President to initiate an investigation into a potential 2020 political rival -- and not the other instances of potential wrongdoing detailed in the report from special counsel Robert Mueller.
Democrats are largely in agreement about the strategy, with Pelosi saying during her press conference on Thursday morning that the whistleblower complaint is "the focus of the moment."
By keeping the impeachment inquiry focused, leaders hope to keep the caucus unified -- with an eye to the moderate members who only recently joined calls for proceedings. The Ukraine matter is also relatively clear-cut and easy to explain to the public, lawmakers say. They also argue the probe, spearheaded by the intelligence committee, will be able to move faster -- possibly in the next month or two -- with a narrower scope.
Rep. Angie Craig, a vulnerable freshman Democrat from Minnesota, who said earlier this week that she supported the impeachment inquiry said after the meeting that Pelosi and Democratic leaders mostly listened to the views raised by the lawmakers.
"I'm in a district where I've been reluctant to move forward only from the perspective where I want to be disciplined, I want to look at due process and want to make sure we get all of our facts -- and this process will allow us to do that," Craig said, adding she backed a narrow probe led by the House Intelligence Committee.
Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, told CNN that he wouldn't -- at this point -- vote for articles of impeachment.
"I would vote no right now because we haven't seen all the facts," Cartwright said. "We have to presume that people are innocent, don't we, and we have to see if what the press has been reporting and what has been revealed in terms of documentation, if if all that is true."
Democrats will hear from constituents about their moves toward impeachment soon, with members scheduled to return to their districts for a two-week recess at the start of October. It will be the first time a swath of members from more conservative districts will receive clear, in-person feedback -- or, in some cases, blowback -- from the people they represent since they joined calls for impeachment proceedings in the wake of the Ukraine allegations earlier this week.
But Rep. Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, said the timing of the recess has its upsides.
"I really can't think of a better thing to do than to sort of check in with the boss before we move forward," he told reporters. "It's actually good timing that we get a chance to go home, catch our breath, get the perspective of people back home, explain what we're doing, and then come back and move forward accordingly."
Once lawmakers return, though, movement is likely to be quick.
"I think it's everybody's intention here to get this done in 2019," said Rep. Jamie Raskin, an impeachment advocate and member of the Judiciary Committee.
"The caucus is unified around the lawlessness and corruption pouring forth from the White House, and our job will be to reduce it to a set of articles of impeachment that make sense to the country," the Maryland Democrat told reporters on Thursday night. "We need a set of articles that make a compelling legal case and that tell a coherent story to the public. And if we do our job right, it will be a unifying exercise for the whole country."
Rep. Anthony Brindisi, a freshman from New York who has resisted calls for an impeachment probe, told CNN that he's "not yet" there on impeaching Trump.
"While I find many of the statements in the whistleblower's report disturbing, there's a lot more information that's out there," Brindisi said. "We have to talk to some of these officials that they have listed in the report here and see where it goes."
More than half the members of the US House of Representatives have said they support an impeachment inquiry, according to a CNN count. However, that count includes many Democrats who say they support an impeachment investigation but are still waiting for the results of the probe before deciding whether to finally vote to impeach Trump. Even if the House could pass the vote, it likely would go nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate, one of many reasons the issue has been politically divisive in the party.
Still there has been a surge in support -- more than 75 House members in about three days -- of launching such an inquiry as part of the fallout from Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky where he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden.
Trump official says lawyers had Ukraine call transcript moved to secure system
A senior Trump administration official acknowledged Friday that White House lawyers directed moving the transcript of President Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to a highly secure system.
Other details about what efforts were taken to move the records are not immediately known, beyond the allegations contained in the whistleblower complaint about that call.
The whistleblower complaint, which was declassified by the Trump administration and released to the public on Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee, alleges that White House officials said they were "directed" by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept.
The whistleblower alleged that the transcript was kept on a different system normally used for classified information. The whistleblower also said that, according to White House officials, it was "not the first time" a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national security-sensitive information. The complaint alleged that the White House tried to "restrict access" to records of the call.
"In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to "lock down" all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced - as customary - by the White House Situation Room," the whistleblower stated.
The White House released an unclassified version of that transcript of the call on Wednesday. The memo, which does not reflect a "verbatim transcript" but is based on "notes and recollections" of those memorializing the call, shows Trump seeking assistance in investigating the Bidens.
"The other thing, there is a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great," he said. "Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it...sounds horrible to me."
This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor Viktor Shokin who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings - where his son, Hunter Biden, was on the board. Biden allies maintain that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.
But the whistleblower's complaint alleges that Trump was soliciting foreign assistance to help in the 2020 campaign. The whistleblower acknowledged in the complaint, though, that the concerns were based on second-hand information.
The White House lawyers" directive to move the transcript has been characterized by top Democrats as a "cover-up."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was prompted by Ukraine developments this week to announce a formal impeachment inquiry into the president, called the move a "cover-up" and said it would be part of the impeachment inquiry.
Meanwhile, Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow downplayed the importance of the record-keeping details.
"A cover-up? Think about that for a moment," Sekulow said on "Fox & Friends" Friday. "The White House secured a call with the president of Ukraine? It's so secret and such a cover-up, here's the documents. This is nonsense."
Ukraine scandal: Pelosi says Barr 'rogue'; former U.S. officials back investigation
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused U.S. Attorney General William Barr Friday of going "rogue" to protect President Donald Trump over his controversial phone call with Ukraine's leader, which has led to an impeachment inquiry.
The California Democrat's words follow a release of the complaint Thursday, which was submitted by an unidentified intelligence official to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Atkinson turned it over to national intelligence director Joseph Maguire.
Barr is mentioned several times in the July 25 phone call, as is Trump attorney Rudolph Giuliani. The complaint says White House officials were concerned enough that they attempted to "lock down" the record of the call.
"[Barr has] gone rogue," Pelosi told MSNBC Friday. "I think where they're going is a cover-up of a cover-up. I think it's sad, to have a Justice Department go so rogue. Well, they have been for a while. And now it just makes matters worse."
Pelosi announced an official impeachment investigation this week after Trump acknowledged he'd withheld military aid to Ukraine. The aid was ultimately granted, but House Democrats want to know whether there was any connection to the aid and Trump's asking Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company for five years.
Also Friday, nearly 300 former U.S. foreign policy and national security officials signed a letter supporting the impeachment investigation. The coalition said Trump's actions constitute a "profound national security concern."
"We applaud those members of Congress, including Speaker Pelosi, who have started us down that necessary path," the letter states. "President Trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic process. That would constitute an unconscionable abuse of power.
"It would also represent an effort to subordinate America's national interests -- and those of our closest allies and partners -- to the president's personal political interest."
Trump has denied there was any impropriety with the phone call. Friday, he denounced the complainant and again said the call with Zelensky was a "perfect conversation"
"Sounding more and more like the so-called whistle-blower isn't a whistle-blower at all," he tweeted. "In addition, all second-hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?"
Vice President Mike Pence also had interactions with Ukrainian leaders, the whistle-blower complaint shows, and he met with Zelensky in Poland earlier this month. He said neither Joe Biden or Hunter Biden were discussed.
Death of Chinese activist in police custody prompts calls for investigation into torture
Human rights advocates are calling for an investigation into the death of a Chinese activist, arrested after holding up a placard calling for Chinese leader Xi Jinping to step down.
Wang Meiyu, 38, was detained in July after he stood outside the Hunan provincial police department holding a sign that called on Xi and Chinese premier Li Keqiang to resign and implement universal suffrage in China. He was later charged with "picking quarrels and provoking trouble," a vague offence often given to dissidents.
According to Wang's mother and lawyer, he died on Monday. Wang's wife Cao Shuxia received a call from police notifying her that her husband had died at a military hospital in the city of Hengyang where he had been held. The police officer on the phone did not offer any explanation of the cause of death.
According to Minsheng Guancha, a Chinese human rights group, Cao was later able to see Wang's body and saw he was bleeding from his eyes, mouth, ears and nose and there were bruises on his face.
"The Chinese government must investigate allegations of torture and the death in detention of human rights activist Wang Meiyu and hold the perpetrators of torture and extrajudicial killing criminally accountable," the Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) said in a statement.
According to Radio Free Asia, Cao said police pressured her to accept their statement that Wang's death had been an accident but she refused. An officer at the Hengyang police station said he could not comment on the case. Wang's mother told the Guardian the family has been offered compensation of more than 2 million yuan (about $220,000).
"Giving compensation without an investigation or criminal accountability for the perpetrator is not true redress nor will it effectively prevent torture," said Frances Eve, deputy director of research at CHRD.
"Especially when a family has effectively been held hostage and thus likely coerced into giving up claims for investigation for the compensation."
Wang's death follows after those of other activists including grassroots lawyer Ji Sizun, who died in police custody in July, Uighur scholar Muhammad Salih Hajim who died last year. Nobel laureate winner Liu Xiaobo who was denied cancer treatment died in 2017 while serving an 11-year-prison sentence and activist Cao Shunli died in 2014, detained after attempting to attend a UN session on human rights in China.
Since Monday, Wang's family has been placed under house arrest, according to CHRD. He has two young children. Others connected to his case have also come under pressure. Late on Wednesday, six armed police detained Xie Yang, a rights lawyer, and Chen Yanhui, an activist, who had met at a hotel to discuss Wang's case. They were released on Thursday.
Wang, who began his work as an activist when his home was forcibly demolished, has been detained and claimed to have suffered torture before.
In 2018 after he held up the placard calling for Xi's resignation, he wrote online of how police stormed into his home, ordering him to write a confession letter and a statement promising he would stop.

Hong Kong police say student arrests at protests increase
Hong Kong police said Friday that students accounted for 29% of nearly 1,600 people detained in anti-democracy protests since June and urged young people to take the "straight and narrow path" as more major rallies are planned this weekend.
Police public relations chief Tse Chun-chung said 207 high school and university students were detained this month alone despite the resumption of classes after the summer holiday, compared to 257 over the June-August period.
He said there was a rise in teenagers participating in violent crimes, with some already charged in court. This included a 16-year-old charged recently with arson, which carries possible a life imprisonment upon conviction, a 13-year-old girl charged with desecrating Chinese flags and others with attacking police officers and carrying dangerous weapons.
"It is an alarming trend to us," he said at a news conference. "It is worrying to see these youths breaking the law and possibly having criminal records at such a young and tender age. We appeal to all youngsters to rethink their actions and hope the education sector and parents will help our young people to walk the straight and narrow path."
Young people have largely led the protests that started in June over an extradition bill that the government has now agreed to withdraw. But the movement has since drawn wider participation as it snowballed into a wider anti-China campaign against what protesters say is Beijing's creeping intrusion into Hong Kong's autonomy promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Protesters have widened their demands to include direct elections for the city's leaders and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality against protesters.
Thousands of people staged a peaceful protest at a downtown square Friday night against alleged abuse of power by police, waving anti-police banners and chanting pro-democracy slogans. The government has said complaints against police will be examined by a police watchdog agency that critics say is toothless and has no real investigative powers.
Police have approved a major rally in downtown Hong Kong on Saturday organized by the Civil Human Rights Front to mark the fifth anniversary of the start of the Umbrella Revolution, when protesters occupied key thoroughfares in the city for 79 days in 2014 to demand universal suffrage. That movement ended without any government concession.
Protesters are also organizing "anti-totalitarianism" rallies in Hong Kong and many cities worldwide on Sunday against what they denounced as China's tyranny.
Tse appealed to protesters to stop hijacking peaceful protests, like what happened in previous rallies when some lobbed gasoline bombs, set off street fires and vandalized public utilities. Police have responded with tear gas, water cannons, and other measures, prompting complaints from protesters that they are using excessive force.
The Civil Human Rights Front is also planning another big march on Oct. 1, sparking fears of a bloody showdown that could embarrass China's ruling Communist Party as it marks its 70th year in power with grand festivities in Beijing. The Hong Kong government has scaled down National Day celebrations by calling off an annual firework display and moving a reception indoors.
Nestle tightens controls on coffee beans after weedkiller scare
The world's largest coffee company said in a statement Friday that it had found glyphosate residues close to the maximum allowed in some deliveries of green coffee beans.
Glyphosate is the key ingredient in Monsanto's weedkiller, Roundup. In the United States, juries have awarded huge monetary damages to people who say their cancer was caused by exposure to glyphosate. Bayer, which owns Monsanto, says the herbicide is safe when used properly, as does the US Environmental Protection Agency.
Neumann Kaffee Gruppe (NKG), one of the world's largest traders, said glyphosate was one of a number of substances it monitored on the coffee it buys. Nestle buys some of its coffee beans from NKG. It was too early to say what consequences Nestle's tighter controls would have on NKG, a spokesperson said.
Nestle's (NSRGF) decision to increase the frequency of checks was unlikely to disrupt global coffee supply chains, a spokesperson said. "This is not a new process, we are just reinforcing controls," the spokesperson told CNN Business. Tests were done before the coffee was shipped from the countries of origin.
Nestle would start with suppliers in Indonesia and Brazil, since these countries are among the world's biggest coffee producers.
"Our agronomists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve their weed management practices, including the appropriate use of herbicides and adoption of other weeding methods," the Swiss company said.
Brands such as Nescafe and Nespresso make up a sizable chunk of Nestle's powdered and liquid beverages business, which generated sales of 21.6 billion Swiss francs ($21.7 billion) in 2018. Nestle last year agreed a deal to sell Starbucks' packaged coffees and teas around the world.
Does glyphosate cause cancer?
Glyphosate is used on more than 100 food crops, according to the EPA. Scientists at an environmental advocacy group with links to the organic food industry say several popular breakfast cereals contain doses of the chemical that are higher than they consider safe for children.
Still, the EPA says glyphosate is not a carcinogen and that it poses no public health risks. Ecological risks include damage to pollinators and the problem of weed resistance, the EPA said in a statement in April.
But that has not stopped thousands of people from filing lawsuits against Monsanto alleging that exposure to Roundup caused them or their loved ones to develop cancer.
Earlier this year, a jury ordered Bayer to pay a California couple $2 billion in damages after they claimed that Roundup, used on their property for more than three decades, had given them both Non-Hodgkin lymphoma within four years of one other. Bayer is contesting the verdict.
A 2015 study by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer found that glyphosate was "probably carcinogenic to humans," based on "limited" evidence of cancer in humans and "sufficient" evidence of cancer in experimental animals. However, a joint panel of the WHO and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization later concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through diet.
Man guilty of killing 6 members of his extended family in Texas
A Utah man was convicted Thursday of killing six members of his extended family in Texas and faces the possibility of a death sentence.
A Harris County jury found Ronald Haskell, 39, guilty in the July 2014 killings of six members of the Stay family: parents Stephen Stay and Katie Stay, and children Bryan, 13, Emily, 9, Rebecca, 7 and Zach, 4.
"We are grateful for the jurors' rapt attention over the last many weeks to every piece of evidence in the case," Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said in a statement. "There was never a reasonable doubt that Haskell meticulously planned and carried out the slaughter of the Stay family."
Police have said that Haskell traveled from California to the Houston suburb of Spring and ambushed his ex-wife's sister, her husband and their five children in their home.
The Stays and four of their children were fatally shot in the back of their heads, and a fifth child, who was 15 at the time, survived. That teen, Cassidy, was grazed in the head by a bullet and played dead.
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in the capital murder case, but jurors will decide whether Haskell should receive a death sentence or life in prison.
At trial, the defense argued that Haskell was insane and heard voices that led him to kill the six people, NBC affiliate KPRC of Houston reported. After the verdict was read Thursday, he hung his head.
"I think he took it as best as you could expect," said Doug Durham, one of Haskell's defense attorneys, according to the station. "He was aware that this was a strong possibility."
The sentencing phase begins Monday. Haskell defense attorney Neil Davis III said his team will work "to save his life. That's our job," according to KPRC.
The sentencing phase is expected to last around 2 ½ weeks, the station reported.
Cassidy testified at the trial and was surrounded by family members. She appeared to be praying before the guilty verdict was read Thursday, according to KPRC.
At a 2014 memorial for her family, Cassidy thanked the community for its support and said that she was comforted knowing her parents, two brothers and two sisters are "in a much better place, and that I'll be able to see them again one day."
Haskell was disguised as a FedEx delivery driver when he went to the Stay home, apparently looking for his ex-wife, who is Katie Stay's sister.
He forced his way inside and tied up Cassidy, officials said. When the rest of her family returned minutes later, Haskell tied them up and demanded to know the whereabouts of his ex-wife. They said they didn't know, and they were each shot in the back of the head.
Cassidy, who was wounded, played dead until Haskell left, and was able to identify him to police. She told officials he was planning to drive to her grandparents' home and kill them. But police tracked down Haskell, and he was arrested after a 20-minute police chase and a three-hour standoff.
US deaths could result in Scottish ban on vaping and e-cigarette ads
A BAN on advertising for e-cigarettes and vaping products, is being considered by ministers.
The First Minister has confirmed that a consultation on the move would take place in "the coming months."
Nicola Sturgeon says that if evidence supports further moves over the sale of such products her Government would "not hesitate" to act.
It comes as it emerged a vaping-related illness had claimed two more lives, bringing the total number of fatalities to 11.
Vaping - which involves inhaling a mix typically made of nicotine, water, solvents and flavours - is seen as an alternative to smoking which can help you quit, but its safety is still not entirely known.
But in the US, more than 500 people are known to have fallen ill with a mysterious lung disease after smoking e-cigarettes. Officials said hundreds of additional cases had been reported in the past week alone.
The first deaths in Florida and Georgia were announced on Tuesday and Wednesday. Currently 38 states have recorded cases of the illness, with lives lost in eight states.
While most patients have reported a history of using products containing THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, the patient who died in Georgia on Wednesday reported only "heavy nicotine vaping."
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has more than 100 officials investigating the cause of the mystery illness, and has warned citizens against smoking e-cigarette products until more is known, particularly if modified or bought "off the street."
The First Minister has confirmed the Scottish Government was monitorigin developments in the US and elsewhere "closely," following the loss of life that has been attributed to vaping.
She pointed out that to date they have not seen any cases of deaths attributed to vaping being reported in Europe.
"Our approach has been a precautionary one, which is why in Scotland we have already taken the strictest regulatory approach in Europe to vapour products," she said.
"The European tobacco products directive restricts the advertising of e-cigarettes and ensures that e-liquids cannot contain ingredients that are known to be harmful.
"The directive also limits the concentration of nicotine in e-liquids.
"In Scotland, we have also introduced a retail register and a mandatory age verification scheme and we have funded trading standards departments in all council areas to ensure that retailers comply with the regulations.
"In the coming months, we will consult on introducing a complete ban on the advertising and promotion of vapour products."
She added: "It is important to stress, and for all of us to remember, that those devices are relatively new and, therefore, their impact continues to be studied. We do not yet fully understand what that impact is, which is why the approach that we have taken has been very cautious.
"That is perhaps a reason why e-cigarette use remains relatively low in Scotland.
"We remain committed to following the best evidence to take any steps necessary to ensure that people are protected from potential harm.
"While we already have among the strictest regimes on those products, if the evidence shows that further action is needed... we will not hesitate to take it."
Cambodian court charges exiled politicians with rebellion
A Cambodian court has charged seven top opposition politicians with plotting armed rebellion for planning to return from self-imposed exile to seek a change in government through mass peaceful protests.
The Phnom Penh Municipal Court also warned that anyone who supported the plans of the Cambodia National Rescue Party to oust the government would also be risking a long prison term.
The returning party chiefs could be sent to prison for 15 to 30 years if found guilty, and their supporters could be sentenced to five to 10 years. Even attending a rally or expressing support online could be considered plotting to topple the government, Justice Ministry spokesman Chin Malin was quoted as saying.
The court's charges on Thursday are the latest salvo in a political battle that has heated up since opposition leader Sam Rainsy announced plans to return from more than three years of exile on Nov. 9 to seek a "restoration of democracy."
Nov. 9 is Cambodia's independence day, celebrating when it obtained its freedom from France in 1953.
"My calls to the people and the armed forces of #Cambodia to rise up against the regime will continue until the regime has restored to the opposition its right to participate in the country's political life including genuine elections," Sam Rainsy said on Twitter earlier this week.
His opposition party was dissolved by the courts ahead of last year's general election, ensuring that an increasingly authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen continued his four decades in power.
The party had been expected to mount a strong challenge in the July 2018 election, and its dissolution was widely seen as being politically motivated, with Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party fearful that it could lose power in the polls.
Hun Sen's government seems unnerved by the planned return of opposition politicians, though the effort appears to be a quixotic one, with Sam Rainsy calling on Cambodian workers in Thailand to accompany him home in massive numbers.
Officials have vowed to arrest Sam Rainsy on his arrival, but there is speculation that Cambodia may simply bar him from entry, which could even keep him from boarding a plane to the country if airlines are officially informed of such a ban. Neighboring countries are also unlikely to allow him to enter from their territory.
However, the government has stepped up arrests of his supporters and there are reports of recent physical attacks on opposition organizers.
Sam Rainsy went into exile in late 2015 to avoid a two-year prison sentence on charges of criminal defamation. Other legal cases have since been lodged against him by the government.
Other top party members fled into exile during a late 2017 crackdown on all opposition to Hun Sen, which included the arrest of the party's co-founder, Kem Sokha. He was charged with treason, based on his links to a U.S. pro-democracy organization, and is under strict house arrest.
This year's Turner Prize-shortlisted pieces will be on display in Margate from tomorrow, with Brexit on the agenda.
Colombian artist Oscar Murillo's work "surge (social cataracts) " depicts people staring out to the North Sea, but with their view of the water and the European continent on the other side of it obscured by a dark canvas, with only a sliver of what lies beyond revealed through a slash in the canvas.
The work is one of four shortlisted entries to the prestigious and often contentious annual art prize, founded in 1984 and given to an artist residing in Britain or British-born but living elsewhere.
Curator Fiona Parry explains that Murillo's work focuses on the current political and socio-economic situation in the UK. The group of papier-mâché figures represent a globalised workforce, while the black cloth represents the "darkness of the contemporary moment in the UK and globally."
She added: "I think it's a broader idea of blocking the view, the outward-looking view, to anywhere really. And that gesture of blocking the light. But I guess there is still this sort of glimmer of hope, there is a slash in the canvas, and you can just see the sea on the horizon."
Helen Cammock's video piece A Long Note, meanwhile, examines the overlooked role of women in the civil rights movement in Derry/Londonderry, Northern Ireland that began in 1968. The work also connects to broader global class, race and gender struggles during the late 1960s.
All works will be exhibited at Margate's Turner Contemporary gallery, from 28 September to 12 January 2020, and the winner of the Turner Prize 2019 will be announced at a ceremony on 3 December.
Named after 19th-century landscape painter JMW Turner, the award made stars of Grayson Perry, Damien Hirst and 12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen.
Man pleads guilty in kidnap, torture plot of plastic surgeon
A Florida man has pleaded guilty to kidnapping a plastic surgeon who was tortured with a blowtorch in an extortion attempt.
The Sun Sentinel reports 34-year-old Justin Boccio pleaded guilty Thursday to kidnapping and conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the January attack on the surgeon, who hasn't been publicly identified.
Boccio's attorney, Kenneth Lange, said his client was convinced to take part in the scheme by co-defendant, Serge Nkorina, who's being extradited from Tenerife, Spain.
Court documents say the surgeon was leaving a Walmart store when he was confronted by an armed man and shoved into a van. They say he was tortured for hours before being returned to his car while unconscious. Surveillance video supports the chain of events. Investigators say Nkorina's wife was a client of the surgeon.
UK parliament rejects second bid for early election
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been dealt another blow in his push for an early election in the United Kingdom.
The House of Commons speaker says under current rules it will not be possible to go to the polls before October 31 - the day Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union.
Parliament has met for the second day since the Supreme Court ruled its suspension as unlawful.
Meanwhile, the EU's lead negotiator, Michael Barnier, says the bloc is still waiting for new plans from the UK.
US sends troops, air defense systems to Saudi Arabia to deter Iran attacks
The U.S. is sending a Patriot missile battery, four ground-based radar systems, and 200 support troops to Saudi Arabia to deter Iran's increasingly aggressive behavior, officials announced Thursday.
A THAAD missile defense system and two additional Patriot missile batteries are prepared to go if needed, the Pentagon said.
"Other countries have called out Iranian misadventures in the region, and we look for them to contribute assets in an international effort to reinforce Saudi Arabia's defense," Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said.
Last week, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said more troops would deploy to the Middle East as a "defensive" measure to help protect against attacks from Iran.
Esper said the deployment was a first step toward addressing Iran's increasingly violent acts in the region -- including this month's drone attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities -- and he called on other nations to step up and condemn the attacks.
Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the Sept. 14 attack on the world's largest oil processing plant and a major oil field, but the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed Iran directly. Iran has denied involvement in the attack.
"It is clear [...] that the weapons used were Iranian-produced and were not launched from Yemen," Esper said Friday, noting that all signs indicate "Iran was responsible for the attack."
The purpose of deploying troops and resources is to "send a clear message that the United States supports our partners" and provide a "free flow of resources," Esper said.
The U.S. calls on other countries to also "stand up and condemn the attacks," as well as contribute capabilities, the secretary said.
Meghan Markle was 'never asked' about Suits cameo
The creator of Suits, Aaron Korsh, has said he "never asked" Britain's Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, to reprise her role as Rachel Zane for a cameo in the show's last-ever episode.
In an interview with Deadline.com following the airing of Suits' finale in the US, Korsh was asked if there was "any possibility" of the former actress being asked "to do even a small cameo."
"Now that we already did it, I will tell you," Korsh replied.
"I thought about asking, and I thought about even using audio footage - that we have to come up with something - and in the end I didn't ask, and I just thought, 'I'm going to respect her new life and not put her in the position of having to ask'.
"We decided not to put her in that position so I never asked."
The Duchess of Sussex appeared in archive Suits footage during the finale's montage.
She starred as Rachel Zane in the New York-set legal drama from 2011 until her final episode aired last year.
In the final series, Rachel's onscreen husband Mike Ross, played by Patrick J Adams, paid a visit from Seattle and was asked how Rachel was getting on.
"If I told you how good, you probably wouldn't believe me," he replied.
Pit bull dies of snake bites while protecting Florida boys
A man in Florida says his family's 8-month-old pit bull Zeus died of snake bites as it was trying to protect his sons.
Gary Richardson told WOFL-TV the boys were outside the family's home in Sumter County, Florida, on Monday, cleaning Zeus' water dish when the venomous coral snake slithered toward them. Richardson says the children didn't see the snake but the dog did and attacked it.
Richardson says the snake bit Zeus four times. The dog was rushed to a veterinarian but he died a day after the attack.
Germany reports landmark case of West Nile virus
Authorities are reporting the first known human case of West Nile virus transmitted by mosquitoes in Germany, a development apparently hastened by climate change.
The national disease control and tropical medicine centers said Friday the person developed encephalitis but recovered after hospital treatment.
The virus originated in Africa but has been spread northward by migratory birds and mosquitoes. There have been several outbreaks in southern and central Europe in recent years. It is found in much of the U.S.
Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of Germany's Bernhard Nocht Institute tropical medicine center said that "the unusually warm summers of the last two years, triggered by climate change, apparently have contributed to WNV establishing itself north of the Alps."
The virus causes dangerous meningitis or encephalitis in less than 1% of those infected.
Men undergoing surgery for prostate cancer fare as well without radiotherapy
Men undergoing surgery for prostate cancer fare just as well without radiotherapy, a major study has found.
The findings, from the the largest ever trial examining those having surgery for the disease, could spare thousands from gruelling treatment which can have distressing side-effects.
The Royal Marsden study involved 1,400 men being treated for prostate cancer.
Half were given immediate radiotherapy, which until now has been standard treatment to prevent the return of disease. The rest were monitored and only given radiotherapy if there were signs that disease had returned.
Scientists found that five years later, there was almost no difference in disease recurrence between the two groups, with those who did not have treatment faring slightly better.
Progression free survival was 85 per cent in the radiotherapy group and 88 per cent in the standard care group.
There was a difference of around 1 per cent between the groups, after data was adjusted to take account of other factors.
The study, funded by Cancer Research UK, found those who had radiotherapy were twice as likely to suffer a worsening of urinary incontinence, one of the main side effects of prostate cancer treatment.
One year after surgery 5.3 per cent of patients receiving radiotherapy suffered a deterioration, compared to 2.7 per cent who had standard care.
Seth Dunlap Louisiana: WWL Radio host threatening to sue over anti-gay tweet sent the tweet himself, station claims, similar to Jussie Smollett case
A radio host in New Orleans said he received an anti-gay slur, sent to him from the radio station's Twitter account. On Wednesday, WWL host Seth Dunlap, who is openly gay, said he planned to sue the station's parent company after working for years in a homophobic and hostile workplace. In a strange turn of events Thursday, the New Orleans Police Department said the homophobic tweet sent to Dunlap came from none other than Dunlap's phone.
The tweet in question was sent earlier this month and the day it was sent, Dunlap hosted his show as usual. But the next day, he announced a leave of absence, CBS affiliate WWL-TV reports.
In a statement, Dunlap said 14 people had access WWL's Twitter account. He claimed he was not one of the people with access to the account.
However, he decided to take a polygraph test to dispel any speculation that he was the one who sent the tweet to himself, his lawyer Megan Kiefer, said. A lawsuit has not yet been filed on Dunlap's behalf, but he said in his statement that one would be coming, according to WWL-TV.
WWL Radio, which is a CBS News Radio affiliate but is owned by Entercom, said in a statement it had investigated the tweet and decided to refer the matter to law enforcement officials. "WWL has completed its investigation into the highly offensive, unauthorized tweet sent from WWL's Twitter account on September 10, which directed a homophobic slur at Seth Dunlap," said WWL Radio in a statement.
"We determined that the most appropriate next step is to involve law enforcement. At this point, the investigation is in the hands of law enforcement and it is not appropriate for us to comment any further on the substance of our findings," the statement continue.
The New Orleans Police Department opened their investigation into the tweet and in a police report Thursday revealed a twist in the story: The homophobic slur was allegedly sent from Dunlap's personal cellphone.
Radio host Seth Dunlap claimed he worked in a homophobic and hostile workplace for years. After allegedly receiving a tweet with an anti-gay slur from the radio station's Twitter, he threatened to sue.
WWL accused Dunlap of threatening the station for money, NOLA.com reports. WWL alleged the 35-year-old radio host said he would "scorch the earth" over the tweet and then demanded over $1.8 million in compensation. According to a police report obtained by NOLA.com, WWL said Dunlap made this threat when he was facing personal financial issues.
The allegations were made by WWL's senior vice president Kevin Cassidy and attorneys for the parent company, Entercom. The police department is still working to corroborate the allegations, but have classified the case as possible extortion. In the state of Louisiana, extortion is defined as "the communication of threats to another with the intention (to) obtain anything of value."
Viola Davis discusses playing Michelle Obama in 'First Ladies'
Viola Davis says she's "terrified" to portray Michelle Obama in a new TV series.
The 54-year-old actress discussed playing Obama in the Showtime series First Ladies during Thursday's episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!
Davis said she's met Obama but has no idea if the former first lady knows about her taking on the role.
"I'm terrified. I'm absolutely terrified," Davis said. "I don't care what else I've done in my life -- I've won an Emmy, I've won an Oscar, two Tonys -- but if I mess this up, this is going to be a defining moment in my life."
"It's like, 'You raised a great kid, but you messed up Michelle Obama,'" she jokingly added.
Davis said, however, that she's confident about the script, written by author Aaron Cooley. Davis and Cooley will also executive produce the show.
"It's going to be a great script, I promise," Davis said. "Listen, I don't want to make my people mad."
First Ladies will explore the political and personal lives of first ladies throughout U.S. history. The first season will focus on Obama, Eleanor Roosevelt and Betty Ford.
In addition to First Ladies, Davis will reunite with Denzel Washington, her Antwone Fisher and Fences co-star, in a Netflix adaptation of Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.
"I had to wear a fat suit," Davis told host Jimmy Kimmel. "I loved it. I told them that I wanted really, really big [expletive]. I wanted to look like the women I grew up with."
Davis plays Annalise Keating on the ABC series How to Get Away with Murder, which premiered its sixth and final season Thursday.
Mac Miller death: Third man charged with drug offences
A third man has been arrested and charged with drug offences in connection with the overdose death of rapper Mac Miller.
Steven Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone pills laced with fentanyl that Miller possessed before he died of an accidental overdose last year of cocaine, alcohol and the powerful opioid.
Walter is accused of being the source of the pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
Ryan Reavis, 36, who was arrested in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, this week is accused of serving as Walter's "runner," who delivered the pills to Pettit.
Walter, who is on supervised release over a 2005 drug case, remains in custody.
A Pittsburgh native whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, Miller's lyrics included frank discussion of his depression and drug use, earning him fans among some of the biggest names in hip-hop.
He was also in a two-year relationship with Ariana Grande that ended earlier in 2018. After his death she posted an affectionate video of him on her Instagram page and released a song, Thank U Next, that lovingly mentioned him.
Miller was one of several musicians whose deaths have been linked in recent years to a national wave of opioid abuse and overdoses.
Prince died in 2016 when he took counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl that looked like a generic version of the painkiller Vicodin.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist for the band 3 Doors Down, also died of an overdose in 2016, and had fentanyl and hydrocodone in his system.
Woman STRIPS TO NOTHING in Walmart to prove she didn't steal
A woman accused of shoplifting at a Walmart in Mexico City took drastic measures to prove her innocence, stripping stark naked in the middle of the supermarket as a stunned security guard looked on.
In a video of the incident, filmed at the Tepeyac Walmart branch in Mexico City earlier this week, a security guard can be seen approaching a woman apparently suspected of theft as she neared the store's exit. Her reaction once she was stopped, however, left the watchman speechless.
The woman first peels off her skirt and begins to proceed toward the exit, but, perhaps unsatisfied her guilt was yet assuaged, soon turned around to remove her shirt as well. Now fully nude, she stormed off, clothes in hand.
The birthday-suited shopper's identity remains unknown, though she appears to have been allowed to leave the premises after the impromptu peep show.
Similar bizarre sights are nothing new for Walmart. In July, security cameras caught a Pennsylvania woman relieving herself into a bin of potatoes at a Walmart in the town of West Mifflin. The woman, who is visibly intoxicated in the footage, was charged with open lewdness, public drunkenness, criminal mischief and disorderly conduct for the deed, and became a viral sensation to boot.
In another case of compelled supermarket nudity this week, a British man, Steve Whitehurst, was forced to expose himself to security guards after they spotted a mysterious "bulge" in his pants. He hadn't stolen anything.
"I can't help the way I'm made," Whitehurst told the Sun.
West Bengal Government Plans To Set Up Museum At Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's House
Kolkata:
West Bengal government has plans to set up a museum at the north Kolkata house of 19th century social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar where he had spent the last few years of his life, state minister Partha Chatterjee said.
The museum will come up at Vidyasagar's residence at Badur Bagan area where pictures and models, chronicling his life from his birth place at Birsinghapur village in Paschim Medinipur district to the house in north Kolkata, will be put on display, he said on Thursday.
Mr Chatterjee, who is the education minister, said this at a function after inaugurating "Vidyasagar Academy" at the Badur Bagan residence on the 200th birth anniversary celebrations of the educational and social reformer.
The minister also released two books, "Amader Vidyasagar" and "Chotoder Vidyasagar" at the programme.
Some items used by Vidyasagar, gathering dust in the storeroom of the house, will be brought out for public viewing at the museum.
This will help the present generation to know about the man, who had waged a war against women oppression and propagated widow remarriage, he said.
The School Education and Higher Education department will organise seminars highlighting Vidaysagar's life and work in schools and colleges during a year-long programme, Mr Chatterjee said.
Listing other activities to be taken up by the academy, Mr Chatterjee said that a collection of hitherto unknown writings by Vidyasagar will be published.
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had recently announced that Vidyasagar's birthplace at Birsinghapur village will be developed as an educational tourist hub.
On Thursday, a bronze statue of Vidyasagar was installed at Vidyasagar College.
"Those who are against the social reforms of Vidyasagar had vandalised his bust at the institution associated with his name," the minister said.
A bust of the social reformer was vandalised during a road show of BJP chief Amit Shah in the city in May.

The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a report on the 26th stating that Iran has started to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, further violating the nuclear agreement reached with world powers in 2015.
Summarizing foreign media reports, the IAEA report states that Iran’ s Natanz Nuclear Facility’ s advanced centrifuge is “accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium”.
Since the US President Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement in May last year and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran has been gradually violating the restrictions on nuclear agreements reached with major powers in 2015.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only use first-generation IR-1 centrifuges to refine uranium.
The other signatories of the agreement, Britain, China, France, Germany, and Russia, have been trying to save the agreement, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
On the afternoon of the 25th, local time, Japanese Foreign Minister Motegi Toshimitsu held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York, where Motegi was paying a state visit, and they confirmed that they will push ahead negotiations for concluding the peace treaty covering the territorial issues of the Four Northern Islands (the disputed islands between Japan and Russia; Japan calls these islands the “Four Northern Islands”, Russia calls them the “South Kuril Islands”), as well as develop bilateral relations across a wide range of political and economic issues in the future; they also concluded that Motegi will pay a state visit to Russia as soon as possible, Kyodo News Agency reported.
This is the first time that Motegi spoke with the Russian side as the person in charge of negotiations for concluding the peace treaty after taking the post of Foreign Minister.
Motegi said to the Russian side, “We hope to pursue negotiations on bilateral issues including promotion of common economic activities across the Four Northern Islands.”
According to the Japanese government, the territorial issues were not detailed at the talks.
The Russia-Japan Summit Talks in December 2018 confirmed the policy of pushing ahead negotiations by appointing the two foreign ministers as the delegates in charge of the issue.
At the talks, the two foreign ministers also recognized the progress made in the negotiation on common economic activities in the fields of tourism and waste disposal.
Motegi expressed his hopes for the trial tourism business scheduled to be implemented in October, “I look forward to its successful implementation, so we can take the next step. ”
Moreover, the talks also confirmed that Lavrov will pay a state visit to Japan during the G20 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Nagoya in November.

Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team Expected to Defend the World Cup Championship in Advance!
On September 27, the Chinese team lost one round to the Dutch Women’s Volleyball Team after winning two continuous rounds, and finally defeated them with a score 3:1, thereby welcoming its ninth successive victory.
As the World Cup comes to a close, the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team can’t ignore the Serbian Team, but the Chinese team will soon defend its championship.
In the first two rounds against the Dutch team, the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team performed as aggressively as before, and won two rounds at 25:19 and 25:16, until encountering a setback in the third round.
As they fell behind, the Dutch Women’s Volleyball Team became more aggressive in their serves and attacked the first passer of the Chinese team, and meanwhile, the Chinese team members were only eager to attack, thereby making more and more mistakes, and finally, the Chinese team lost the round at 21:25 to their opponents.
Lang Ping said in an interview after the race, “In the third round, we lost about 8 points due to mistakes. ”
Of course, the Dutch Women’s Volleyball Team is not to be underestimated, and the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team was prepared to meet the challenge before the match, so Lang Ping wasn’t surprised when the team lost one round, “It’s normal to win or lose a match against a powerful team, and it’s also normal to play five rounds, so we told our team members to work hard”, said Lang Ping.
In the fourth round, the team members actively adjusted their tactics: Zhang Changning attacked with full force, scoring 8 points in a single round and contributing greatly to the team’s victory.
To date, only 2 rounds in 11 of match play remain, and the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team nearly has the championship in hand, but the race against the Dutch team has truly sounded an alarm for the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team: the more critical the moment, the more effort should be made.
In another match on September 27, the Russian and American women’s volleyball teams played 5 rounds, and the American team failed to score 3 points from their opponents, thus, the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team can defend its championship by one round in advance, as long as it scores three points in the match against Serbia.
All things are currently going in the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team favor.
The six primary players of the Serbian team will be absent from the match, but this does not necessarily mean they will easily lose three points to the Chinese team.
Judging from the current league table, it is essentially impossible for the Serbian team to win the cup, which means that they will feel no stress in the match against the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team, but they will also make every possible effort to attack the Chinese team, while the Chinese team, in contrast, will feel pressure to defend the championship, which could possibly affect its state.
Besides, the Serbian team, now consisting of backup players, is absolutely not a lamb for anyone to slaughter; in an earlier match against the Dutch team, the Serbian team played five rounds, and finally the Second Serbian Team turned the situation around and defeated the Dutch team, which was composed entirely of first line players, at 3:2, reflecting a very powerful lineup.
Before the matches at the third stage started, Lang Ping noted that neither the Dutch team nor the Serbian team was easy to handle, “The matches in Osaka will be very tough, so we should still prepare properly as usual. ”
Now, the team has sounded the call to defend the championship, and the match has entered its “white-hot stage”.
The Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team has prevailed over its rivals in both ability and lineup, but we still need to wait and see whether the members of the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team can perform at their normal level and unleash the full extent of their powers on the court.

"For 70 years, the containment and defensive measures of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have been based on maintaining technical advantages," Stoltenberg said in the United States Military Academy (West Point). "
He said, "But times are changing."
Stoltenberg said:” The competition we are facing is getting fiercer and fiercer.
So, we should double our efforts to ensure that no one will surpass us. "
He said, "Some new technologies were not developed by the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but in authoritarian countries.
Chinese companies are studying 5G networks.
Russia is developing an independent internet and investing heavily to develop the next generation of weapons, such as hypersonic missiles. "
Stoltenberg said, "The future security of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization depends on our ability to understand, accept, and apply the latest advanced technologies."
On September 24th, the "Take me on a trip with a cruise ticket" event was held in Juzizhoutou, Changsha, for which more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to board the Star of Juzizhoutou cruise ship to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiang River, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the republic of China.
Most of the more than 100 disabled people who participated in the event had never boarded a cruise ship before.
56-year-old Zhao Zhengang is a physically handicapped person who rarely travels due to his inability to use his feet.
He said, "This is my first time on a cruise, I’m very excited to be able to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Xiang River up close and feel Changsha development pulse, and I won’t ever forget this. "
Volunteers from the Changsha Fukang Social Work Service Center and the Blue Sky Rescue Team provided outstanding services for people with disabilities.
For those with severe physical disabilities, volunteers carried them on and off the cruise ship.
The relevant manager of the Fukang Social Work Service Center said that in the past 70 years, with the support of the party and the government, the cause of disabled people in Changsha has continued to develop and make progress, and more and more disabled people have truly become participants and contributors in the economy and society, while caring and helping the disabled and supporting the disabled cause have gradually become widespread social consensus.
As China is about to celebrate the 70th anniversary of its founding, the media is turning its spotlight on the heroes who we barely notice in daily life so that they dazzle under the spotlight, because they are the ones whose brilliant efforts bring us warmth and light, and improve all of our lives.
However, the heroes who walk by our side appear to be ordinary, just like you and me.
Like an old farmer strolling in the fields, Yuan Longping, who devotes himself to hybrid rice research and cultivates a high-yield hybrid rice strain to prevent nationwide starvation; or Nan Rendong, a chief scientist who strives to open China's "eyes" (the world’s largest telescope, FAST), who has concentrated on one thing throughout his entire life, and who, as he eats dry steamed buns in the mountains of Guizhou, a remote area, looks similar to the old men who have experienced the hardships of life in that small village; or Zhou Ruchang, China's leading scholar of the classic novel A Dream of Red Mansions, who was once a rural boy who received a very late education and still had an innocent heart in his old age, and though he possesses a thorough knowledge of both China and the West, he doesn’t act like a scholar at all, instead appearing to the world as a man with disheveled white hair who laughs heartily when he encounters valuable ideas; or Qin Yi, whose fame as a filmmaker is overwhelming in China, and who still frolics in the grasslands for six or seven hours a day for rehearsal despite being over 90 years old, and was willing to perform as an anonymous old maid in “Legend of the Devil Cat”.
They seek their own virtue and live a simple but persistent life, and their passion ignites as they are immersed in careers which outsiders do not understand but which they themselves cherish, regardless of high position and great wealth.
Just like the floor-sweeping monk in the Sutra Pavilion of Shaolin Temple in Jin Yong's novel - though he is exceptionally skillful in martial arts, he is neither arrogant nor vainglorious, neither happy nor sad.
Behind every "floor-sweeping monk" and every innocent heart, one can see their deep feelings of love and responsibility for the country.
The responsibility to develop our country lies not only on the shoulders of heroes, but on hundreds of millions of Chinese.
Once the words of a female middle school student were popular among netizens, "When a hero passes by, someone has to sit roadside and applaud, I don't want to be a hero, I just want to be the one who sits roadside and applauds. ”
In fact, there is no contradiction between being a hero and applauding a hero.
People who applaud by the roadside are also giving us warmth and light, because they themselves are bright-burning stars.
Ordinary people also sometimes have moments in which they become heroes, like Zou Bihua, an excellent judge in Shanghai who shouldered the important task of judicial reform.
But at the annual meeting, he asked the old master of the reception room to come on stage and tell his story, and it turned out that the master sent and received countless newspaper and letters in a whole year without a single mistake, to which Zou Bihua said, "It isn’t easy to do simple things perfectly," and then led the judges in a round of applause for this "floor-sweeping monk".
This is the kind of respect one hero pays to another.
The floor-sweeping monk has the Sutra Pavilion of Shaolin Temple; Yuan Longping has his vast experimental rice fields; Nan Rendong has FAST; Qin Yi has her stage; and Zhou Ruchang has a pulpit…it takes more than just our own efforts to become a hero, it also takes a good environment and positive incentives.
Take, for example, things like FAST, which looked at today, seem like a miracle.
In the 1990s, China's scientists were still struggling to combat difficulties, and the novelist Liu Cixin had not yet started to write The Three Body Problem.
At that time, the largest telescope was at Arecibo, a single-aperture radio telescope in a Puerto Rico valley of the United States, with a diameter of 350 meters, and was considered to be an "unsurpassed" world landmark.
The diameter of Chinese telescopes was less than 1/10 of that.
Nan Rendong, who enjoyed world-class scientific research conditions and salary in Japan, insisted on returning home with an almost crazy idea: to build a new generation of "radio telescopes" in China to receive more messages from outer space!
With so much waiting to be done in China, why would it invest money to listen to stars?
However, the motherland trusted Nan Rendong, and thus began the FAST project.
It took 12 years to select the site and another 9 years from the establishment of the project to its completion.
With a diameter of 500 meters, China’s "eyes" are now open, and that’s how China created an unprecedented second-to-none scientific project.
This is how FAST and all the scientists like Nan Rendong is amazing, as well as how China, which has foresight, stands high, and looks far, is also amazing.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, those like Nan Rendong can become pillars of our country and the courage of our people.
Young talents and white-haired heroes walk by everywhere as people applaud gently by the roadside: what a beautiful and harmonious nation!
Garbage classification introduced to kindergarten in Jilin for the first time
A kindergarten in Jilin City, Jilin Province, launched a garbage classification education class to teach children how to distinguish between recyclable garbage and other types of garbage on the 27th.
It is reported that this is the first time for garbage sorting to be introduced in local preschool education.
Nine departments in Jilin Province jointly issued the Work Plan of Promoting Garbage Classification in Prefecture-level Cities in Jilin Province.
Based on the experience of compulsory garbage classification in Changchun in 2019, the government decided to carry out it in prefectural-level cities.
Jilin City is one of them.
We hope that through this activity, children can affect their family, while the kindergarten itself can persuade all of society to take up garbage classification to protect the environment.
Said Liu Lijuan, executive head of Haifaner International Kindergarten, which held the event.
The director read out the environmental protection proposal, hoping that children would take the lead in sorting garbage.
After performing dance called "Low-carbon Baby", children were divided into groups to play garbage sorting games.
Their instructors also issued labels with words like "Recyclable Waste" and "Other Waste" to children for them to stick on the trash cans and suggested that they shoot a short video when they get home.
Liu Lijuan said the kindergarten has always advocated the concepts of low carbon and environmental protection, and that environmental protection lectures are held on a regular basis.
Sortable trash bins are also placed inside the kindergarten, which bear symbols of garbage types.
The teachers educating children about recyclable garbage, photographed by Cang Yan.
Preliminary statistics show that Jilin Province created around 5.4652 million tons of solid waste in 2018, and that all of it was processed at domestic waste plants.
3.2929 million tons were landfilled, 2.0923 million tons were incinerated, and 80,100 tons were utilized in various ways.
After years of effort, all cities and counties in the province now are capable to process domestic garbage in a non-damaging manner.
The issued document, Work Plan for Promoting Garbage Classification at the Prefecture Level in Jilin Province, requires the introduction of garbage classification on campus, in textbooks, and in classes through the creation of garbage classification songs, ballads, comics, and micro videos, as well as strengthening interaction between students and parents, which the government believes is the best way to universalize this concept, ”educating a child to influence his family, then the community, and finally the next generation".
According to data released by Mazda on September 27, global sales in August were 117015 units.
Due to the impact of insufficient launch of new models and reduction of price, sales in China dropped by 21%.
Domestic sales in Japan decreased by 6%, and the need to get on the last bus before the increase of consumption tax in October was limited.
Mazda sold 17729 vehicles in China in August.
Sales in August of 2018 also decreased by 13% from the previous year, and continued to decrease.
Sales of the CX-4, the most popular SUV in China, decreased by 14%.
It has been a long time since the "CX-4" launch in 2016, and the influence of new cars has declined.
The decrease of price reductions due to a long-term strategy to increase brand value has also been reported to have a significant impact on sales.
Mazda’s sales in the U.S. increased by 7% year-on-year to 27482, which was an improvement after 14 months.
In August, the fact that sellers had one more business day than the previous year, together with the "promotional activities such as improving publicity" (Mazda), made the sales of SUVs such as "CX-5" increase.
Domestic sales in Japan fell by 6% to 14422 units.
The company said that the urgent rush to buy before the tax increase "was not as intense as the last time (2014)."
Sales of small cars such as "Demio" decreased.
Jacques Chirac passed away, left a long-lasting political legacy
On the 26th local time, former French President Jacques Chirac died at the age of 86.
At a time when the world was undergoing great changes, much of the political legacy left by this French politician when he was in power are still worthy of our praise.
Chirac served charismatically as president of France for 12 years.
He inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of Gaullism, firmly supported European integration, and is a representative figure in the pursuit of the "European Dream".
As a politician with strategic vision, he vigorously advocated for a multipolar and multilateral world.
For this reason, the French media described him as "an outstanding representative of France on the world stage".
One of Chirac's most widely known decisions is his staunch opposition to the US-led Iraq invasion.
Under his leadership, France, together with Germany, withstood pressure from the United States and stood at the forefront of the anti-war movement.
One year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would aggravate terrorist activities and make the world increasingly dangerous.
Later, Chirac's warning proved to be quite correct.
Now the European integration is bowing in the midst of a raging storm, and as American unilateralism is becoming increasingly prominent, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices in international politics and global affairs is undoubtedly of enlightening significance.
Chirac is also a French politician who is familiar and well-liked by the Chinese.
He is one of the advocates of and creators of the "Golden decade" of Sino-French relations; after being elected president of France for the first time in 1995, he used his position as a politician and his strategic vision to promote the rapid development of Sino-French relations.
China and France soon established a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2004, and the bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a brand-new phase.
During his presidency, the bilateral trade volume between China and France increased rapidly, while the two nations have made spectacular breakthroughs on cooperation in aviation, nuclear energy, railway transport, and other fields.
The “Chinese Culture Year” advocated by Chirac created a novel model of cultural exchange unique in the history of China and France.
Chirac's ardent and life-long love for Chinese culture was particularly impressive.
A Chinese diplomat who knew him well said that Chirac could recite some poems written by Li Bai and Du Fu, and could even accurately judge the historical age of Chinese bronzes.
Chirac has a well-known quote: "One hasn't really been to Egypt without visiting the pyramids; one hasn't really been to China without visiting the Terracotta Warriors.”
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency, Chirac said, "The West has concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems which have emerged during China's economic growth, and China's political status in the international arena.
However, I myself have full confidence in China.
I regard it as a country with long history of civilization, and its experience is enough to help itself establish the concept of harmonious development and assume its own responsibility on the world stage in the long-run. ”
The renaissance of China will bring vitality and creativity to the world’s culture, as well as enrich it.
He is gone, but the political heritage and enlightenment he left to the world will last forever.

Councilors of the Establishment Camp in Hong Kong SAR Legislative Council Countersign against US’ Hong Kong-related Act
On September 27, some councilors of the Establishment Camp in Hong Kong SAR Legislative Council signed a joint declaration to voice their strong opposition against the “Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019” passed by the US Congress Committee on Foreign Affairs.
The declaration, countersigned by 40 councilors from the Establishment Camp, stresses that the rights enjoyed by Hong Kong are conferred by the Basic Law on the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, including maintaining its status as a free trade port and separate customs territory, conducting trade, cooperation, and relations development with different countries/regions worldwide under the name of “Hong Kong China”, and signing and performing bilateral and multilateral agreements.
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislative authority.
Hong Kong has always strictly observed international protocols, international rules, laws, and commercial ethnics, traded with different countries and regions, and participated in the cooperation covering a broad range of areas, and Hong Kong has made outstanding achievements visible to all people.
The declaration asserts that the US Congress Committee on Foreign Affairs has no need to pass related act, and the act is only a means to echo its role as a troublemaker to Hong Kong, make a tough intervention in the internal affairs of Hong Kong, and seek political chips for their agents who disturb Hong Kong in the region.
The councilors of the Establishment Camp feel deeply regretful of the US Congress’ move and strongly oppose it.
The declaration points out that Hong Kong is an important trade partner of the US and its largest source of trade surplus.
Hong Kong is a good destination for American companies do business thanks to its good legal governance, free and fair business environment, and clean society.
The passing of the act by the US Congress will further worsen China-US relations, harm both the US and China, and will not bring any benefit but only damage to the interests of both Hong Kong and the US.
The declaration notes that Hong Kong will carry out the “one country, two systems” guideline as usual and without change, will continue to enjoy the rights vested by the Basic Law, and will effectively perform its obligations.
Hong Kong will continue to make its due contributions to the international community as well as international trade and commerce, as it has in the past, does so in the present, and will do in the future.
The French National Assembly and Senate will discuss reforms to immigration policy next week, European Minutes reported on the 26th.
French President Macron recently commented with regard to this topic that France cannot “accommodate everyone”, but will strive to make a “proper accommodation”.
According to the report, Macron is attempting to find a compromise in immigration, so there will not be a sharp impact on the brewing debate.
“We hope to propose a dual-track solution in immigration policy, and find the balance between humanitarianism and efficiency,” Macron said in an interview during the General Debate of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Macron said, “To make a proper accommodation (of immigrants), France cannot accommodate everyone.”
Macron enumerated four key points of immigration policy: granting the right of asylum to refugees who need protection as soon as possible; promoting the integration of immigrants more effectively; accommodating and protecting all immigrants entering France; re-accommodating illegal immigrants entering French more effectively.
Whether illegal immigrants should be under the protection of National Medical Assistance (AME) is a topic debated hotly by all circles.
Macron said he hoped to “evaluate” and put a certain restrictions on, but not cancel, this system.
After Macron made such comments, Le Pen, the leader of the far right “National Alliance”, tweeted that Macron indulged in empty talk.
Larcher, a member of the right-wing Republican Party and the President of the Senate, also said that the immigration policy should be discussed in a “moderate” but “realistic” manner, indirectly criticizing Macron.
Vallaud, a senator of the left-wing Socialist Party said that France should accommodate more immigrants and do it better, and criticized Macron for “manipulating” this issue.
As reported, the new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act has been enacted for a year, leading to dissension within the ruling party and failure to appease the right-wing opposition party.
In the next election in 2022, the topic of immigration policy will again become a flashpoint for the far right, and Macron needs to make a difference on this topic, despite the risk of irritating the left wing within the ruling party.
The French National Assembly will enter into a debate on immigration policy from September 30, and the Senate will debate it from October 2, said the report.
There are signs that China’s A shares are ushering in a “buy-back tide”, and many listed companies are vigorously buying back their corporate stocks.
As of the 27th, the total amount of A-share listed company buy-backs in 2019 has been over RMB 100 billion, far exceeding buy-backs in previous years and hitting an all-time record, according to statistics from Eastmoney.com, a financial data service provider.
The overall valuation of the A-share market is low this year, and by buying back at a low price, the listed companies can improve their capital usage efficiency, which also reflects their desire to actively manage market value and their abundant cash flow, which can boost investors’ confidence, said Xu Yang, the chairman of Shanghai Maikerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd.
Moreover, the continuously improving share buy-back system has also promoted listed companies to actively buy back their shares.
For instance, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued detailed rules for buying back shares, providing standards and guidelines for listed companies.
According to some media statistics, since this year, many listed companies in fields such as capital construction, real estate, IT, and electronic equipment manufacturing, have implemented overweighting and buy-back plans.
There are 6 listed companies with buy-back amounts over RMB 1 billion this year.
Out of these companies, Yili Shares is ranked first, with a buy-back amount over RMB 5 billion.
What impact will the listed companies’ buy-back have on the market?
The buy-back, on one hand, shows that the listed company is economically strong and financially healthy, and has the capacity to stabilize its share price and give investors confidence, but on the other hand, it also means that the listed company and its controlling shareholders are responsible for the company, the market, and investors, said Zhao Xijun, the deputy dean of the School of Finance, Renmin University of China, in an interview by China News Service.
The former is based on the company’s good business performance, while the latter requires the listed company and its controlling shareholders to be of high quality.
All of these are the important and fundamental elements for the capital market.
Stock buy-backs by listed companies can give investors more confidence, and support the stock price of listed companies.
The Orient Securities’ research report calculated that A-share market capital will increase up to RMB 150 billion due to buy-backs this year, based on the buy-back amounts predetermined by A-share listed companies at the beginning of the year and the average closing cost of stocks that have been bought back.
After almost 2 months, the restoration of the large mural Drawing of Miracles of Mazu in the Tianjin Temple of the Queen of Heaven, a key cultural relic under state protection, ended on the 26th, and will reopen during the National Day holiday this year.
The Drawing of Miracles of Mazu is a large traditional mural that fully reflects Mazu's life.
With the approval of the relevant departments of China, it was painted by Cai Changkui, the former curator of the Tianjin Folklore Museum (Temple of the Queen of Heaven) from 1991 to 1994.
It is understood that this mural was drawn on the south and north walls of the main hall of Temple of the Queen of Heaven with a total of 32 meters length and 2.6 meters in height; the mural is divided into upper and lower parts, and it makes use of over 30 stories, such as the birth of the queen of heaven, crossing the sea on a seat, and flying to heaven by growing feathers, as well as 358 characters to reflect life stories of Mazu.
Cai Changkui said that it has been rainy in summer and dry in winter in Tianjin in recent years, and that this kind of “wet and dry” weather caused the mural to crack, such that cracked portions cover 60% of the entire mural.
In order to protect and restore the mural of Mazu's stories, the Ancient Culture Street Management Committee in Nankai District of Tianjin and Temple of the Queen of Heaven started the restoration of the main hall and murals in the temple.
The restoration project was led by Cai Changkui and four famous Chinese painters were invited to participate.
The restoration is in line with the principle of “restoration to past condition”, however, the original mural was partially adjusted, and additional restoration was carried out on imperfections in the original mural.
During the restoration, we also made innovative attempt in color, material, ink, and other aspects.
After the restoration, the features, spirituality, spirit, and art style of the original mural were intact.
The Temple of the Queen of Heaven was built in 1326, was formerly known as Tianfei Temple, and is commonly known as Temple of the Queen; after being rebuilt many times, it is the oldest building group in Tianjin and it is also one of the earliest Mazu temples in China.
On September 25th, a grand opening ceremony was held for the Beijing Daxing International Airport.
The Beijing Daxing International Airport terminal is shaped like a “phoenix spreading its wings” and is honored as the first of the “New Seven Wonders of the World”.
Currently, Beijing Capital International Airport is overloaded with traffic having carried over 100 million passengers last year, making it the second airport in the world to handle more than 100 million passengers in a year after Atlanta’s airport in the United States.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to handle 45 million passengers by 2022, with international flights accounting for 20%, and 72 million by 2025, with international flights expected to be above 30%.
So, how cool is this "new gate to the nation"?
Beijing Daxing International Airport, located between Daxing District of Beijing and Guangyang District of Langfang City, Hebei Province, with a straight-line distance of 46 kilometers from Tiananmen Square, is the largest newly built airport in the world.
The projected area of the steel roof of its terminal on the ground is 180,000 square meters, the same area of 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is the world's first terminal which has two arrival floors and two departure floors -- F1-F4, respectively, are international arrivals, domestic arrivals, domestic departures and international departures.
The two-level bridge outside the terminal connects to both the highway and the airport, F3 and F4 of the terminal -- the upper level goes to international departures, while both levels connect to domestic departures.
The first flight from Beijing Daxing International Airport initiated Beijing’s "two airports" era.
The new airport is positioned as a major international aviation hub, a new driving force for national development, and as an integrated transport hub for Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei to support the construction of the Xiongan New Area; to date, 66 airlines have expressed interest in flying from Beijing Daxing International Airport, including 20 domestic airlines and 46 airlines from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and foreign countries, for which the flight schedule applications are slowly undergoing approval.
In winter and spring of 2019, Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, including 101 domestic routes and 15 international routes, which cover 112 destinations around the world, including 97 domestic destinations and 15 international destinations.
It forms an internationally competitive first-class “two-hub” airport layout alongside Beijing Capital International Airport through coordinated development and moderate competition, which not only reduces the close-to-capacity operating pressure currently felt by Beijing Capital International Airport, but also better meets the urgent need for rapid growth of air transport in Beijing and its surrounding areas, and thus enhances the international competitiveness of China's civil aviation.
To secure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daxing International Airport has fully considered its geographical location, and the relationship between the airport and the surrounding airspace and operation environment: its airport runways arranged in an "omnidirectional" layout for the first time in China, it uses the largest air traffic control system in the world, and contains the largest terminal control area in China, which maximizes aviation operational efficiency.
It’s the first time for an airport in China of such size to use automatic baggage handling and an information management system made in China, and the airport uses an innovative baggage transfer model to improve the efficiency of the baggage handling system.
The first flight from Beijing Daxing International Airport symbolizes a phoenix spreading its wings to take off.
The new airport, which has created over 40 global and national “firsts”, and which is more than 98% made in China, will certainly exert direct and indirect economic influences on the surrounding industries, and will inject the airport’s vitality into Beijing's economic development.
MCA tentatively plans to hold a conference in November, plans to lower party’s minimum age to 16
MCA tentatively plans to hold a central representative conference in early November, intending to revise the party constitution and lower the party’s minimum age to 16.
As the parliament lowered the voting age in the general election, MCA announced the 66th Central Representative Conference to be held this year, and proposed amendments to the party constitution, including lowering the minimum age of Malaysian Chinese to join the party, from the current 18 to 16.
MCA President Datuk Seri Wei Jiaxiang said that the MCA Central Committee was originally scheduled to convene a central representative conference on November 2 and 3 this year, but due to the by-election of the Tanjung Piai Parliament, the date of the conference may be changed.
He said that since the Election Committee will finalize the nomination and polling days for the Tanjung Piai Parliament by-election on October 1, and they will meet the next day, on October 2, to discuss whether to change the date of the central representative conference this year.
He also explained that the purpose of convening the Central Committee yesterday (26th) was to finalize the date of the representative conference and amend the party constitution, however, it happened to coincide with the unfortunate death of Datuk Mohammad Faree, Bersatu Tanjung Piai Parliament member, thus it has been joined with the agenda for this by-election.
Wang Boxiang, Former Party Secretary of Shouguang County in Shandong Province, Xinhuanet
Wang Boxiang was born in February 1943 in Shouguang, Shandong Province, started work in 1967, and successively served as the secretary of the township party committee, secretary of the county committee, and mayor.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang was appointed as the Party Secretary of Shouguang County in Shandong Province, and at that time, Shouguang was a poor county in Weifang.
During his five-year tenure in Shouguang, Wang Boxiang, who had a desire to serve the people, concentrated on doing three things: first, promoting vegetable industrialization; second, developing the salt marsh in the north of Shouguang; and third, laying the foundation for industry to succeed so that the people of Shouguang could fill their pockets and live with dignity.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables, and also have learned lessons from the practice.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers had abundant harvests of vegetables, but the vegetables could not be sold and rotted in the field.
Through research, Wang Boxiang found that the key to the vegetable industry is to improve circulation.
Shouguang took the lead in establishing a vegetable wholesale market, which was the start of its market economy development.
Party members and leaders should take the lead, because if they fail, the whole county bears the losses.
In 1989, 17 Party members, including Wang Leyi in Sanyuanzhu village, set up 17 winter-warm vegetable greenhouses with the support of Wang Boxiang, and 17 “double 10000-yuan households” emerged in the village that year.
Then the county set up a promotion group, and mobilized by Wang Boxiang, Wang Leyi carried out traveled to various villages and towns to offer guidance; in the first year, more than 5000 vegetable greenhouses were constructed, and then, like a prairie fire, the greenhouses spread to the whole county and even the whole country.
For thousands of years, 1.6 million-mu of land in the north of Shouguang has been shoals, except for a salt marsh.
Life was very hard for the local people.
The south of Shouguang had vegetable greenhouses, so what was the north of Shouguang to do?
Wang Boxiang organized tens of thousands of people to hold a general meeting and then camp at the salt marsh for 40-50 days.
Wang Boxiang and other county leaders lived and ate on the construction site, pushed carts and carried loads alongside the ordinary workers, and went through the rigors of living in the wilderness; the common people gave them a thumbs up sign when they saw them, and admired them from the bottom of their hearts, while at the same time, 150,000 mu of shrimp ponds, 200,000 mu of salt fields, and 600,000 mu of cotton fields were developed in the north of Shouguang, creating a “cornucopia” in the salt marsh.
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang participated in the Weifang Industrial Conference for the first time as a secretary of the County Committee.
During the conference, a “comparison table of industrial economic figures in 12 counties and cities in Weifang” was issued, and at first glance, the total industrial output value of Shouguang was not bad, ranking fourth.
However, if the raw salt was not counted, the pure industrial output value of Shouguang was only 119 million yuan, ranking third from the bottom.
Wang Boxiang took an experience learning group of more than 70 people and went to other places to seek new ideas.
Less than a year after returning, 150 million yuan had been invested in 77 new projects throughout the county.
After that, they organized “experience learning groups” to travel to places such as Shenzhen, Dongguan, and Shanghai to learn more.
Shouguang lacked enterprises, and even lacked entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang held a special meeting to resolve this problem: 40 enterprising and able people stood out from the public selection of factory directors and managers, and were promoted to the frontline of industry.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the top 100 counties in the country, and Wang Boxiang was transferred to serve as vice mayor of Weifang.
What he left behind was more than 200,000 vegetable greenhouses, 120,000 mu of cotton fields, salt fields, and shrimp ponds, 4854 enterprises, more than 100,000 “10,000-yuan households”, and cadre teams approved of by the common people. Shouguang people still affectionately call him “our Secretary Boxiang”.
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi hosted the China and Security Council African Member States Conference of Foreign Ministers at United Nations Headquarters in New York on September 26 local time.
African current Security Council Member States Cote d'ivoire’s Foreign Minister Tarnow, Equatorial Guinea’s Foreign Minister Oyono, and South Africa’s Foreign Minister Pandor, as well as candidate Member States Niger’s Foreign Minister Kara and Tunisia’s Foreign Minister Jessnawi attended the meeting.
Wang Yi made four suggestions on strengthening cooperation between China and Africa in the Security Council.
First, obtaining strength through unity.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, and the direct consequence is that the basic norms of international relations are challenged, the role of the Unite Nations is impacted, and the interests of a large number of developing countries and middle and small countries, including African countries, are harmed.
China and Africa need to work hand in hand and side by side to meet this challenge, because only through unity can they have strength.
In the Security Council, when the three African countries speak with one voice, the focus is not just on their three votes, but the entire African continent.
When China and Africa stand together, it adds up to more than four votes, and instead leads other countries to follow up, and thereby influence and shape the Security Council agenda.
In 2018, China established the “3+1” coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council, so we must make full use of this coordination mechanism.
Second, we must resolve disputes through negotiation.
China has always advocated the political resolution of hot-button issues, and Africa has a good tradition of negotiation, as well as the experience of successful mediation by regional and sub-regional African organizations.
For many complex problems in the Security Council agenda, especially hot-button issues in Africa, most are the legacy of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
We should jointly make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and give full play to the role of the United Nations in mediation, conciliation, etc.
Third, we must seek self-improvement autonomously.
African countries and people know best about Africa’s problems, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
When dealing with hot-button issues in Africa, the Security Council should pay attention to listening to and respecting the wishes of Africa, should allow regional and sub-regional organizations to play their role, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is willing to strengthen coordination with Africa and firmly promote capability building for autonomous peace operation in Africa.
Fourth, resolve root conflicts through development.
China and African countries are both developing countries, we must persist in putting economic and social development first and mutually support the development path chosen by each nation.
China is willing to closely link the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative with the 2063 Agenda of the African Union, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries to enhance their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
We will jointly push the United Nations to increase investment in the development of Africa.
The Ebola epidemic outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has restarted, and China has and will continue to fully support and provide human and material help with our power; China is also willing to coordinate its actions with African nations to mobilize the institutions such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization to expand assistance and give full play to the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Multiple Departments (Including the Neonatology Department) Saved a Little Life Together.
Breathtaking!
A pregnant mother delivered her second child, a 32-week-old premature infant, in the passenger seat of their car as her husband was driving on the way to the hospital.
Fortunately, the obstetricians and neonatologists provided timely treatment, and together saved this little life.
Coincidentally, the Obstetrics Department and Neonatology Department of the Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital in Hubei received three premature infants delivered in this matter three days in a row on the 19th, 20th and 21st, but the other two babies were both 29-week-old and delivered in the 120 emergency hotline ambulance.
Ms. Cheng, whose delivery of her second child was imminent, felt stomach pains at 7:00 am on September 19, so she packed up all maternity items and prepared to take a shower and then go to the hospital, in consideration of the fact that she was 32 weeks pregnant and her first child was also premature.
After 9:30 am, Ms. Cheng was ready, and her husband drove her from their home in Xudong to the hospital.
But unexpectedly, soon after they took to the road, the baby was delivered in the passenger seat.
20 minutes later, Ms. Cheng and her baby arrived at the Obstetrics-Gynecology Building of Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital in Hubei.
Seeing the flustered couple and the baby, the security guard informed the Obstetrics Department immediately, and quickly , the associate chief physician, Zhang Huan, three other doctors, and the midwife Liu Yanyan grabbed the maternity package and umbilical cord tray rushed downstairs to them.
“She was sprawled in the passenger seat, with amniotic fluid and blood under her body, and next to her there was a baby boy with the umbilical cord connected. ”
Zhang Huan was informed that the baby was a 32-week-old premature infant, and as the parents had no time to cover the baby with a blanket in their rush to get there, in the cool morning of the early autumn, the baby wasn’t crying, and had a sickly pallor, limp arms, and cold legs.
Liu Yanyan rushed to treat the umbilical cord while Zhang Huan got into the cab and covered the baby with layers of sterile towels and swaddle from the maternity package, and then cleared the baby’s respiratory tract (as shown in the photo), and then, after this careful treatment, the baby was taken to the Neonatology Department on the 12th floor.
Upon being informed, the neonatal doctors and nurses rushed to the nurse station and rescued the premature baby on the spot.
The baby was black in the face and asphyxiated at times, so the doctor used tracheal intubation immediately, and in less than a minute, the baby’s heartbeat was restored, his skin turned ruddy, and the resuscitation was successful.
After admission, the 32-week-old baby was treated with an invasive ventilator, and the continued rescue effort finally allowed the baby’s breath to be steady and smooth, after which the ventilator was removed the next day.
After a week of treatment, the baby now has stable vital signs, regular breathing, and has begun to suckle.
Coincidentally, the hospital’s Obstetrics Department and Neonatology Department received three premature infants delivered on the way three days in a row on the 19th, 20th and 21st; the other two babies are both 29 weeks old and were delivered in the 120 emergency hotline ambulance, and they are now being treated in the Neonatology Department.
Sun Guoqiang, the director of the Obstetrics Department, said, “In recent years, our hospital has received many babies delivered in subways and private cars, but without proper care, both the baby and the mother will be in mortal danger.”
Mr. Sun suggested that once an expecting mother experiences stomach pains, rupture of membranes, or sees blood, she should go to the hospital immediately.
If the baby is being delivered at home or on the road, the mother should lie on the back and put a blanket under the buttocks to prevent the head of the baby hitting the floor, and the newborn baby should be kept warm and brought to the nearest hospital.

"The most beautiful unmarried princess in the world" is engaged!
According to the British "Metro News", Buckingham Palace announced on the 26th that British Princess Beatrice and Mozzi were engaged.
It is reported that Mozzi is a 34-year-old Italian billionaire, mainly engaged in real estate development.

Up To Three Points Per Free Throw?
On the 27th (GMT+8), the NBA Gatorade League announced the new free throw rule - one free throw will be worth one, two, or three points depending on where and when a player is fouled on the shot.
The NBA star Shaquille O’Neal has a low free throw percentage.
Under the new rule, a foul on a made shot will result in a usual free-throw shot worth one point, a foul on a missed shot in two-point range will result in one free throw worth two points, and a foul on a missed three-point shot will result in one free throw worth three points.
The rule will not apply in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter or for the entirety of any overtime period.
This rule is only an experiment in the NBA Gatorade League in the new season, but fans are more concerned about what impact it will bring on players if the new rule is enforced in NBA.
Many people think that the new rule may be good for James Harden, but bad for LeBron James, as his free throw percentage is less than impressive.
Wuhan offers subsidies of up to 20 million yuan to promote the smart transformation of industrial enterprises
As this reporter learned from the “Appreciate New China and Welcome CISM Military World Games” press conference, held by the Information Office of the Wuhan Municipal Government on the 27th, since the beginning of this year, Wuhan has accelerated smart transformation of industries, and will grant a transformation subsidy of up to 20 million yuan.
To date, demand for smart transformation has been recorded from more than 800 above-scale industrial enterprises.
Zhang Hong, deputy director of the Wuhan Economy and Information Technology Bureau, said that starting from this year, Wuhan will launch an action plan for the smart transformation of industrial enterprises, providing free consultation and diagnosis services and solutions for industrial enterprises above a certain size in need to comprehensively promote a new round of technological transformation to create advanced enterprises.
Wuhan will publicly select a number of professional diagnostic service institutions every year based on this plan, and will conduct a general demand survey for all industrial enterprises of above a certain size in Wuhan through media forums, questionnaires, door-to-door reports, etc.
So far, smart transformation requirements from more than 800 above-scale industrial enterprises has been collected, accounting for nearly 1/3 of above-scale industrial enterprises.
Five municipal diagnostic platforms have organized teams to enter enterprises in batches, which will then carry out well-targeted on-site evaluation and scheme demonstrations.
Zhang Hong said that at present, 373 smart transformation projects are being arranged and implemented, with a total planned investment of 29.76 billion yuan, and that pioneering smart workshops and smart factories are initiating such projects, such as Hongxin Communication's first 5G smart production line in central China, Motorola's leading smart mobile phone production line, Wuhan Siemens unmanned transformer factory, CASIC's first batch satellite production line, Hvsen’s world-leading smart production line for new veterinary drugs, and Oubon’s IoT smart production line.
Beyond this, Wuhan has also increased financial and fiscal support for smart transformation projects.
Industrial enterprises carrying out smart transformation will receive investment according to their actual completion, including equipment, hardware, and R&D investment, with a transformation subsidy of 8% and a maximum of 20 million yuan.
At the same time, the municipal government has proactively joined forces with the Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Commercial Bank Wuhan Branch, and other financial institutions to provide personalized financial services specifically for industrial enterprises involved in this project to alleviate their financing pressure.
Will wearing blackface pose an obstacle for Trudeau’s reelection plan?
It was Trudeau himself who dug the pit he fell into this time.
Recently, the Canadian media have exposed a number of old photos of the current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which his face was in dark make-up.
This was considered an obvious act of racial discrimination and immediately caused an uproar in Canada.
Afterward, Trudeau apologized to the public.
But it seems that the Canadians aren’t so easily placated.
Trudeau lifted a rock only to drop it on his own toes.
As pointed out by political commentator Riley, since the rise of the "anti-blackface movement" in the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been accused the opposition or dissidents of their own party of such violations, repeatedly declaring that "whoever makes a mistake like this should be fired immediately".
To put it simply, it was Trudeau himself who dug the "big hole" into which he fell.
Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, is young and handsome, and has been extremely popular since he became involved in political circles.
Despite his lack of experience in political elections, he achieved an unexpected outcome in the 2015 Canadian federal legislative election after taking over the Federal Liberal Party, and the Federal Liberal Party won the valuable right to form a separate cabinet with more than half of the seats in the Federal House of Commons.
At that time, Trudeau espoused many enlightened political slogans, such as "ethnic and gender equality", "ecological environmental protection", "economic revitalization", and “anti-corruption”.
But the truth is, during his five years of governance, he has come to a dead end in almost all of the above-mentioned aspects and little progress has been made.
Despite the "blackface" incident, he only paid lip service to "ethnicity and gender equality", causing indigenous groups and leaders to move protest tents to the gates of Capital Hill on the 150th anniversary of Canada.
In terms of anti-corruption, Trudeau was involved in the "SNC Lavalin incident" at the end of last year.
It was exposed that SNC Lavalin, a construction and engineering company in his hometown, had engaged in favoritism and committed irregularities, and instead of punishing the offender, Trudeau breached ethics rules by pressuring the former justice minister to ensure SNC Lavalin avoided a corruption trial.
Once the matter grew in significance, Trudeau became angry with the official who disclosed the corruption case, Jody Wilson-Raybould, the Attorney General of Canada, who was the first person to disclose the fraud case and directly handled it.
Although doubts still remained in the case itself, his interference is undeniable.
Observers point out that the collapse of Trudeau's reputation after five years in power was primarily caused by his own deeds, and that now he is paying the penalty for falling to fulfill his promise and exercising loose self-discipline.
According to Canada's most authoritative Angus-Reid poll, the number of respondents who supported Trudeau has slipped from more than 60% to just over 30% since 2015, while opponents have soared from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Although other opposition parties and their party leaders have performed poorly, and a considerable number of voters are still willing to vote for the Federal Liberal Party, the voters are dismissive of the head of the ruling party.
On October 21st, when the new Canadian federal legislative election is about to begin, will Trudeau be able to reproduce his victory five years ago?
The answer may disappoint him.
The establishment of Beijing Daxing International Airport has a far-reaching and positive effect on enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration, and the integrated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area.
Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened on September 25.
This Beijing News reporter learned from the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission that the Beijing Capital Airport is already oversaturated, and the opening of Daxing International Airport will greatly improve Beijing’s aviation service capacity.
Beijing has become the second city with two airports after Shanghai, in that similar to the model wherein Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport mainly serves domestic aviation, while Pudong Airport mainly deals with international shipping and aviation, Capital Airport and Daxing Airport will also provide differentiated services to serve domestic and international aviation in the future.
The opening of Daxing Airport is beneficial to Capital Airport from a business development perspective.
In 2018, the passenger throughput of Capital Airport exceeded 100 million, ranking first domestically, but its transport capacity is not enough to cope with the rapid growth of demand, especially the demand for international routes.
In order to better serve domestic and foreign passengers in their tourism and business trips and keep up with Beijing’s trend of internationalization, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large hub for international flights, and it is estimated to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million while also offering mail transportation handling volume of 4 million tons.
Therefore, the two airports play separate roles, target different customer groups, and have sufficient market space.
From the economic perspective, Daxing Airport will obviously help to produce win-win result, ease the tense situation of Beijing’s aviation capacity, accelerate the growth of passenger and cargo throughput volume, and achieving dual-track growth for the capital’s aviation industry.
For users, the opening of Daxing International Airport gives them another option beyond Capital Airport, and also perfectly resolves problems caused by the excessive concentration of routes, such as long transit guarantee time and slow boarding speed of passengers, which may indirectly increase the stay time of aircraft and passengers at the airport and make airport operation less efficient, thus, by alleviating burdens of the Capital Airport, the new airport also improves the travel experience for passengers.
Based on media reports, we have calculated the time and cost of various transportation routes to this airport: 1) 50 minutes’ drive by taking the Jingkai Expressway directly to Daxing Airport Expressway from the South Fifth Ring Road, which will cost 40 yuan in total, with the highway tolls being 15 yuan; 2) take Daxing Airport Subway, for which the distance varies from 20 km and 30 km, and for which the ticket price is 10, 25, or 35 yuan; 3) take the Jingxiong Intercity Train, which takes only more than 20 minutes from Beijing West Railway Station to Daxing Airport Station.
On the whole, a variety of means are available for citizens to reach the Airport, and the cost and time are reasonable.
From the perspective of overall development trends, Daxing Airport is positioned as a Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei transportation hub, meaning it is positioned a little far away from Beijing, but it strengthens Beijing’s connection to Hebei and Tianjin, makes it easier for more people to travel, and is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
Passengers in Hebei and Tianjin will enjoy more international air route services provided by Daxing International Airport, which is expressed in its traffic planning.
Daxing Airport’s supporting transportation facilities are well-equipped, and beyond the new airport line from downtown Beijing to Daxing Airport, a number of highways also connect Daxing Airport with the surrounding areas.
Just like passengers in Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan, and other cities near Guangdong can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport through the Guangzhou-Foshan and Guangzhou-Shenzhen expressways, residents of Langfang and Xiongan New Area will also benefit from Daxing Airport and have access to convenient and efficient aviation services.
Therefore, the opening of Daxing International Airport is not only about extra runways and aircraft, it has far-reaching and proactive impacts on enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration, and the integrated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei; it is not only related to the long-term layout and development of Beijing's logistics industry, but provides more travel options for the vast number of residents in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, promotes the service quality of Beijing logistics industry, and also promotes the development process of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integration and the economic and trade development of the areas around Daxing Airport.
So, as we take account of the opening of Daxing International Airport, we should look beyond the mere benefits to individuals and see its greater benefit to society’s overall development.

2019 Vietnam Forum on Economic and Social Issues held in Thua Thien-Hue Province
Ruan Dejian, Deputy Director of the Economic Committee of the Vietnamese Congress, revealed that at the beginning of this year, Vietnam’s economy and society presented many new improvements and continued to maintain a trend of growth.
This forum focused on the prominent economic and social issues in the first few months of 2019, and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and in 2020.
At the forum, the participating delegates exchanged in-depth opinions and views on 4 topics, which included economic development in 2019, the impact of some free-trade agreements, some prominent issues of the Vietnamese economy, society and culture in 2019, and predictions and suggestions for economic and social development in Vietnam in 2020.
Delegates generally believed that in the first few months of 2019, global economic growth had slowed down, and that risks and challenges had increased.
Trade frictions between major economies had further contracted global trade and investment.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), despite the fact that global economy is full of uncertainties, and 70% of the world ’s economies are in a state of stagnation, Vietnam’s economy has still achieved many gratifying developments, the macro economy in Vietnam has been operating smoothly, and inflation has been effectively controlled in the first half of 2019, while the consumer price index increased by an average of 2.64%, which is the lowest increase in the past three years.
In the first half of 2019, the GDP of Vietnam increased by 6.76%, and although the rate is lower than 7.05% in the same period last year, compared with the same period in the 2011-2017 period, the growth rate is still relatively high.
When making predictions about Vietnam's economic development trend from 2019 to 2020, Deng Deying, Deputy Director of the National Economic and Social Prediction Center of Vietnam, said that in the context of world economic turmoil, the Vietnamese economy in 2019 showed strong growth.
It is estimated that by 2020, Vietnam's macro economy will continue to be basically stable, the implementation of various free-trade agreements will help promote trade, but as economic restructuring and the improvement of the business environment will be further strengthened, due to the impact of trade friction, Vietnam's export activities will show a downward trend.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen monitoring and risk warning mechanisms, proactively seek trade remedy measures for Vietnam's export commodities, look for opportunities to expand new export markets, and create convenience for the export of various commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, the inflation rate should be kept at a reasonable level to promote the development of auxiliary industries, and the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture, and ecological agriculture should be supported.
Liu Zhijie, director of the Consular Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Siem Reap, held a reception in Siem Reap on the 26th to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Peoples Republic of China.
During the 70 years since the founding of the Peoples Republic of China, China has actively participated in international affairs, offering Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to improve global economic governance and common development, and thus has made important contributions to world peace and development, and has brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic growth, as well as people's livelihoods and well-being, said Liu Zhijie.
Liu Zhijie said that as the world's second largest economy, China is responsible for more than 30% of world economic growth, and especially thanks to China's "Belt and Road Initiative", China's local provinces and cities on one side and Siem Reap and its neighbors on the other have made substantive headway in their cooperation.
He said that this is the 61st year of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia, and that as the two countries share brotherly friendship, their mutually beneficial cooperation will become the driving force for local economic and social development.
Tea Seyha, governor of Siem Reap Province, spoke highly of China’s great achievements over the past 70 years, and congratulated both sides for accomplishments made throughout friendly cooperation between China and Cambodia.
Tea Seyha hoped that the two sides would continue to work together to promote Sino-Cambodian friendship, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit, and continue to improve people's living standards.
Tea Seyha said that the friendly exchanges between Siem Reap and China’s provinces and cities are noticeable, in that Siem Reap has established friendship-city relations with 28 provinces and cities in China so far, and collaboration projects including large-scale cultural tourism complexes, namely "Angkor Smile" and "Angkor Dynasty", the Siem Reap-Guangxi agricultural demonstration park, the Siem Reap new international airport project, special training courses for Siem Reap provincial government officials, scholarships for Siem Reap students studying in China, free rural clinics, construction and improvements of urban roads, as well as a public welfare project for cataract treatment called "Guang Ming Xing", have proved fruitful, and in which the people of Siem Reap have become the direct beneficiaries.
Khim Bun Song, the secretary of the Ministry of National Defense (Cambodia), the president of the Siem Reap Provincial Council, the governors of five provinces, representatives of the Siem Reap Branch of the Council of Sino-Cambodia, volunteer teachers, representatives of the Chinese Siem Reap Branch of Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, representatives of Chinese enterprises, and diplomatic representatives of foreign nations in Siem Reap attended the reception.
Witnessing the decade of digital China in Cloud Town—Xinhuanet
If the 2009 local website forum is regarded as the starting point, the 2019 Cloud Town Conference held in Hangzhou from the 25th to the 27th has gone through a full decade.
From a visional concept to a "cloud" practice, big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies supporting China's economic development, social management, and public services in the past 10 years.
In the CHNT New Energy Photovoltaic Cell Workshop in Haining, Zhejiang, recently, a new “colleague” loaded with Alibaba's artificial intelligence was placed beside the quality inspector.
It works 24 hours a day, the recognition speed is more than twice that of manual checks, and the accuracy of quality inspection is stable at more than 95%.
According to the company's director, the "quality inspector" with the camera has concentrated on learning from more than 40,000 defective samples, and with the power of cloud computing behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary language and sort out defective batteries.
The company is just one example of how cloud computing is helping to transform manufacturing today.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the Guide to Promote the Cloud Implementation of Enterprises (2018-2020) in 2018, and proposed that by 2020, they will strive to achieve a noticeable increase in cloud awareness and enthusiasm for enterprises, as well as a significant increase in the proportion and depth of cloud adoption.
Alibaba Cloud founder Wang Jian said that data-centric cloud computing has built a bridge and opened the way for the digital economy where data is a key element.
At the same time, in the past 10 years, the scale of China's cloud computing industry has continued to expand.
According to the White Paper on Cloud Computing Development (2019) released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology in July this year, the total market size of China's cloud computing in 2018 reached 96.28 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2% over 2017.
In addition to being a key technology supporting industrial transformation and the development of digital economy, the invisible "cloud" has also imperceptibly changed urban management and social life.
In this year's Cloud Town Conference, the "city brain" presented for three consecutive years is still attracting people’s attention.
According to Alibaba Cloud, the current urban brain has become a city management hub from a traffic management tool, and related cooperation applications have been expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception and artificial intelligence algorithms, the city brain can realize new city management service functions such as “stop and pay”, “real-time perception of visits”, and “tourist route design” through powerful computing capabilities.
In the field of government service, “One Cloud” is used to connect with “One Affair”, and “Office on Mobile” and “Service on Mobile” are jointly promoted, cloud computing has brought convenience to both ends of the government services.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform across the province through government affairs on the cloud.
As of September 11, this platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, and collected 19.08 billion pieces of data in 3066 categories.
Zhejiang's government departments make an average of 12 million calls and share data every month, and each additional call on the cloud may mean less people running errands.
Be Cautious about Making Tea with Plastic Tea Bags!
The Central News Agency reports that the latest Canadian research has found that one plastic tea bag may release billions and even tens of billions of plastic particles, which is significantly higher than the number of plastic micro-particles a person takes in throughout the year, however, no evidence so far proves that the intake of plastic particles is a danger to humans.
According to the report, the researchers of McGill University found that after soaking in a cup of hot water that is almost boiling (95 Celsius degrees), it will release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanometer-size plastic particles in the cup.
This quantity is significantly higher than the number of plastic micro-particles a person takes in throughout the year.
Earlier research published in 2019 reveals that generally, a person consumes at least 50,000 plastic particles and aspirates the same amount of plastic particles.
In this study, which was published in the Environmental Science and Technology Journal, the researchers tested four different types of commercial plastic tea bags collected at stores and cafes in Montreal, opened the tea bags, cleaned them, soaked them in water that was almost boiling for 5 minutes, and then analyzed the particles with an electron microscope and spectrograph.
According to their research, a single tea bag can release more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, “which is higher than the plastic load of other earlier foods by several magnitudes”.
According to the report, most tea bags are made of natural fibers, but many tea bag brands which use natural fibers still seal the bags with plastics.
Some brands no longer use paper tea bags, but have turned to plastics, and it is these plastic tea bags that the researchers tested.
Plastic particles are tiny fragments of plastic, and researchers have defined the size of these plastic particles at 100 nanometers to 5 centimeters, which are produced mainly from the decomposition of plastic garbage.
Researchers have found the traces of plastic particles in the air, soil, and rivers across the world, as well as in the deepest oceanic trench, and these plastic particles also can be found in tap water, bottled water, sea foods, and beer.
In October 2018, researchers first detected plastic particles in human feces samples collected in several countries of different regions worldwide.
To test the potential toxicity of the plastic particles released from the tea bags, this Canadian research team put water fleas into polluted water and found that these plastic particles affected the behaviors of these fleas and caused them to suffer developmental malformation.
So far, there is no evidence proving that the intake of plastic particles threatens humans, says the World Health Organization (WHO).
However, the WHO points out that we should perform more research to fully understand how these plastic particles spread in the environment and how they affect people.
The researchers surmise that these tea bags release a large number of plastic particles possibly because after contact with the boiled water, these plastic bags, even “food-grade” plastic, may decompose or leach toxic substances after they are heated to above 40 Celsius degrees.
Guterres said that the climate emergency is the largest threat to the survival of small island countries.
There, natural disaster will erode their development achievements within one generation.
The disasters in Barbuda, Dominica, and the Bahamas, which have been hit by hurricanes, serve to illustrate this point.
About a quarter of people in small island developing countries live at an attitude of 5 meters or less above sea level.
Relocation may seriously affect their society and lifestyle, and may even cause problems with aspects of sovereignty and national identity.
At the Climate Action Summit on Monday, small island countries worked together to realize carbon neutral 100 percent renewable energy before 2030, becoming leaders for the world to move in the right direction again.
Guterres said, "The climate crisis is stacking new injustices over old injustices.
Although contributing little to global warming, small island developing countries have paid the highest price.
Since these countries are middle-income status, many are caught in accelerated and unsustainable cycles of disaster and debt.
The world must take action, for now is the time to make big decisions and make large investment in small island developing countries. "
Today’s high-level meeting issued a political declaration calling for seeking a method to help small island developing countries to manage their disaster risks, invest in basic facilities with climate adaptability, and transition to renewable energy, and also urged international organizations to help small island developing countries, especially debt-ridden middle-income countries, to obtain funding.
Small island developing countries are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the earth’s lifeline--the ocean.
The latest special report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week confirms that the ocean is suffering from "sweeping" serious consequences of the climate crisis.
According to this report, once-in-a-century sea level rise may occur in many regions by the middle of this century.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable if significant funding is not invested in adapting to the problem.
Pollution, overfishing, and acidification have caused huge losses.
The world has lost half of its live coral in the past 150 years, and plastic pollution has been increased by 10 times in the past 40 years.
Demand from industry, shipping, mining, and tourism is leading to reduced resources, including the fish stocks necessary for maintaining many island communities.
Small island countries also faces high costs of transportation, energy, and basic facilities.
They depend heavily on certain external markets and are subjected to price fluctuation.
Some countries are struggling to deal with the security implications of illegal trafficking in persons, weapons, and drugs.
Guterres said, "If a problem can be solved in the most challenging environment, the problem can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing countries to realize the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons, and examples for the world to learn from. "
He emphasized that the small island developing countries were special cases of sustainable development.
They need long-term attention and investment from the entire international community.
India’s financial system has sufficient liquidity, says its Finance Ministry.
Driven by holiday spending, India's economy is expected to grow again in the second half of the current fiscal year, as the financial system has sufficient liquidity, Finance Minister Sitharaman said on the 26th.
Sitharaman made the above statement after meeting with representatives of private banks, non-bank financial institutions, and housing banks in India.
Sitharaman did not indicate the relevance of these remarks.
Earlier, some Indian and overseas media attributed India's sustained economic slowdownto the current tight liquidity of non-bank financial institutions.
Citing the decline in auto sales, Sitharaman denied that liquidity was the main reason for the drop.
Sitharaman noted that the decline in auto sales was largely driven by cyclical factors.
And he expected growth to resume in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday spending.
India's annual shopping season starts in September and runs until the end of the year.
Shopping is expected to be a big boost to India's economy.

The production of fertile sows must be implemented, while the subsidy policy for fertile sows must be conscientiously put into effect; the pig-breeding companies shall be encouraged to expand breeding scale, and the companies shall select outstanding sows from the commercial pigs in a planned way.
Policies to attract investment should be put in place in which the top priority is to recruit well-known domestic large-scale breeding enterprises that have not yet entered our province.
The market circulation system shall be thoroughly implemented, and the construction of cold chain logistics facilities for pigs shall be sped up to comprehensively promote the transition from "transporting pigs" to "transporting meat".
The modern epidemic prevention system shall be finalized, and all localities should be equipped with epidemic prevention and quarantine personnel in line with the scale of breeding and work tasks to build the first line of defense for epidemic prevention and control.
Sui Zhongcheng required that all efforts be made to ensure meat market supply, to ensure that large-scale shortages and large-scale supply cuts do not occur, and to ensure a stable supply of pork on major holidays.
The meeting also made arrangements to continue to do a good job in preventing and controlling the African swine fever epidemic, banning and withdrawing fishing in important waters of the Yangtze River in our province, and acquiring mid-to-late period rice in the province.

“Over-age migrant workers on some construction sites may account for more than half.
Where can we find young workers?
Though we do not want to use so many 'old people' on the construction site, there is nothing we can do about it. ”
Zou Kui sighed, who has worked as an engineering contractor in construction industry for many years, because recently, quite a few over-age migrant workers (over the retirement age) are working on construction sites.
Recently, the university where this writer is located has been carrying out rain and pollution diversion project, which means many migrant workers work inside the campus, and if we pay attention, we notice that many of them are over-age migrant workers.
They do not work because they feel bored at home, they do so out of necessity as they save money to solve pension and medical issues, or to finance their children; these are the driving forces for these senior citizens, who should be retired and enjoy their later years.
It’s not as easy as we might think to ensure those workers be well taken care of.
Raising children, supporting the elderly, paying for their children’s education, helping the next generation build houses and buy cars, and helping them to them get married and settle down, and raising their grandchildren are the ”life tasks” for these workers, and when these migrant workers have completed their "life tasks", their pockets are empty, or they may even incur heavy debts, causing most of them have little savings.
To support their children and save more money for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "working until they can't anymore".
Younger migrant workers, like those born in the 1980’s, 1990’s, and 2000’s, are unwilling to engage in secondary industries or low-end service industries that are difficult and require heavy labor, resulting in a structural "labor shortage", which in turn means these unattractive jobs provide opportunities for over-age migrant workers.
Due to the lack of skills and the decline of physical function and working ability, a great deal of over-age migrant workers are doing jobs with heavy physical demands, low income, high risks, and few guarantees.
Behind their attitude that “every day and every cent count”, the difficulties surviving faced by these “tireless” over-age migrant workers must not be ignored or disregarded.
Their living conditions can be enhanced through guaranteeing their right to get paid, improving labor protection, reducing safety risks, and increasing labor income, because despite the fact that they "can save themselves", it is also important to have institutional protection and humanistic care from the public sector.
Some scholars have pointed out that over-age migrant workers are unlikely to be able to rely on farming in their hometowns to resolve their pension and medical problems, and that they have to find other ways to support their families.
Understanding the helpless mood and strong character of these “tireless” over-age migrant workers will help us to better understand their love and pain.
The public sector, the market, and society need to share responsibility and work together to create beneficial interactions, so that as we notice these over-age migrant workers and hear their plight, we can think of ways to ensure they genuinely are taken care of when the return to their hometowns.
Chemezov said that Russia would not export the system in the next five years, because “it must supply our army firstly, and only then can be produced for export.”
This practice fully conforms to international practice.
The main producing countries of weapons and military equipment always ensure their own defense needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, Yuri Glekhov, deputy commander in chief of VKS, said that the development of the system was about to completed.
The S-500 system was developed by the “Almaz-Antey” air-space defense Konzern.
This is next-generation air defense system, which adopts the destruction of ballistic and aerodynamic targets as its working principle.
The main function of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles; the S-500 can intercept missiles within a range of 3500 kilometers.
In addition, according to some data, the S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles, aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft and hypersonic missiles with speeds exceeding 5 times the speed of sound, even targets located in near space.
This weapon also can be integrated with other air defense systems, especially the S-400 system, to form a unified network, which is very important from the perspective of national defense.
Sergei Chermezov paid special attention to the S-400.
He said that there was currently great demand for the system in the world, but the Russian army also needs it, including in the Arctic region.
The S-400 air defense system was put into service for the Arctic air defense group.
According to the news on September 15, the modification of the S-400 air defense missile system by the Arctic air defense group in Novaya Zemlya has been completed.
This is not Russian militarization of the Arctic region.
The Russian Ministry of Defense said that this was entirely part of a transition process to more advanced defense tools in the northern strategic direction.
The Russian Northern Fleet News Service said, “With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controllable airspace of the Arctic region is significantly increased. "
It is critical that the system is used successfully in the Far North and Arctic regions, according to the military’s assessment.
The officers and soldiers of the air defense group were trained for the new system and ready for combat duty.
S-300 long-range air defense systems were provided there previously, and one part of that systems remains at present.
The air defense system must have weapons capable of destroying various aerial targets, no matter whether the targets are flying at high speed in the outer atmosphere at high-altitude or are neglected targets close to the protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 “Triumph” system developed by the “Almaz-Antey” air-space defense Konzern is designed for attacking strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets, and other air attack weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within the range of 400 kilometers, and can shoot down the ballistic target flying at 4.8 km/s within a range of 60 kilometers.
Russia has never concealed that it will supplement and deploy air defense forces in the Far North to ensure the airspace safety of the Northern Sea Route.
The first 12 sets of “Tor-M2DT” air defense missile systems were delivered to the Russian arctic region not long ago, and together, they were sufficient to form an air defense battalion to strengthen the air defense system in the Arctic region.
At the time, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the Arctic “Tor” army would be expanded to a complete brigade-level system in the future.
Together with the S-400 long-range systems newly deployed in Novaya Zemlya and the “Pantsir-SA” short-range system deployed in the Far North, these advanced air defense weapons form a powerful defense for Russia’s polar sky.
It will be difficult for enemy aircraft, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicle missiles to break through this defense.
According to the ideal of the Russian government, the flagship store will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, and thus avoiding the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
Epinduo Company, as an operator of Russian goods store, focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
Epinduo has online stores on China’s largest trading platforms such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, ShouQ, and multifunctional instant messaging software Wechat, and has its own online platform Epinduo.com, as well as Russian goods retail chain stores.
The Russian Export Center, in partnership with Epinduo, will develop store market strategies and participation standards, and will screen enterprises which put products on virtual shelves.
The store plans to open at the end of this year, and to place products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers on its shelves.
Data from the Russian Export Center shows that there are up to 1 billion total monthly visits to Chinese e-commerce platform.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been showing steady growth since 2014, exceeding 1 billion USD in 2018.
At present, Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia, and Singapore within the global import strategic framework.
According to Alexei Kozevnikov, the new store will display goods from enterprises with a sales volume of at least 5 million rubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and the sales volume of 5 million rubles is not enough.
We all know that Chinese customers have a very positive attitude towards Russian goods and regard our goods as high-quality and green products. "
Kozevnikov said that competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and intensifying.
He said, "Our goal is ambitious, because we will launch 500 enterprises through the store within three years. "
Meanwhile, the platform will put products from enterprises in the Russian Far East on its shelves.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, professor of Trade Policy Foundation Teaching and Research Section of Plekhanov University of Economics, Russia, said, "This is a political project representing the image of both sides, because the Russian Export Center is a state-owned institution rather than privately owned institution.” "
"I haven’t seen a large amount of highly competitive Russian goods on the market." "
He thought that the project would probably not be implemented, but it would help strengthen the relationship between the two countries.
According to RIA Novosti, Andrey Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Center, said during Eastern Economic Forum that product information from more than 170 Russian enterprises has been published on the largest international wholesale online platform Alibaba.com, and the products can be purchased both in China or in other countries.
Another model of cooperating with the Alibaba Group is a project to train Russian enterprises by experts from Taobao University, the first seminar of which was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Center will organize the participation of Russian enterprises in industry exhibitions and commercial projects at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November this year.
A large exhibition will be held in a 1000-square-meter exhibition hall, which will be the center for holding commercial project activities, agreement signing ceremonies, and promotion conferences, as well as meeting with Chinese enterprise representatives.
Currently, about 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Information Service of the Russian Export Center said, "In addition to agricultural exhibition stands, well will definitely hold business conferences, which will arrange direct contact among entrepreneurs. "
"This is another direction in our efforts to support enterprises and ensure to arrange dozens of special meetings for them. "
In addition, master classes, cooking contests, as well as Russian food tastings cooked by Russian famous chefs and of the "Exploring Russian Food in Shanghai Station" project will be held at the Expo.

Xinhua Commentary: Follow firmly our own path without hesitation
The white paper, China and the World in the New Era, released on September 27th, states: Over the past 70 years, China has achieved great success, and the ultimate reason is that China has found and will continue on the right path – socialism with Chinese characteristics.
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people for China to follow its own development path.
In modern times, China was reduced to poverty and weakness, as well as threatened by domestic strife and foreign aggression, and generations of people with lofty ideals have sought a path to save the country and the people.
However, "They thought it over and tried constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentary system, a multi-party system, and a presidential system, but all failed. "
It was not until the Communist Party of China and the People’s Republic of China that the Chinese people gradually opened up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The path China has taken is the path to happiness for the Chinese people, the path to rejuvenation for the Chinese nation, and the path to common development for China and other countries in the world.
Only by following the right path can China run its own affairs well, become the world's second largest economy, contribute the most to the global economic growth, and benefit the world through its own development.
As the white paper says, China’s development path conforms to reality and the requirements of the times, and will look to ever brighter prospects as time passes.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how difficult it is to find the right path; and looking around the world, the Chinese people appreciate the right path even more.
The Chinese know oranges change with their environment, and understand that what is suitable for others may not be suitable for themselves, but only what is suitable for themselves is the best.
It is with this confidence in its path and strategic determination that China has created a globally recognized miracle.
In the twists and turns of mankind’s time on earth, the "theory of the end of history" was popular in the world for a time.
Today, the success of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics declares the end of the "theory of the end of history", the collapse of the "theory of the collapse of China " and the failure of the "theory of the failure of socialism".
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries that they build a prosperous country with a strong and powerful people, has expanded the methods for developing countries to modernize, and provided experience and references for countries and nations who wish to speed up development and maintain their independence to follow a path suitable for their own national conditions.
We live in a diverse and interesting world.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose a development path suitable for their national conditions.
China doesn’t "import" foreign models, nor does it "export" the Chinese model, and China will unwaveringly follow its own path, maintain its own continuous development, strengthen governance exchanges with other countries, and make its due contributions to jointly realizing good governance.
A Foodworks supermarket owner has been slammed for the “disgraceful” sacking by text of a 66-year-old female worker after the Fair Work Commission found he dismissed her because he preferred to hire employees from Asian-speaking backgrounds.
The commission said the treatment by owner Jianbin “Eddie” Wang of Gail Ayton, who had worked at the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, was “grossly unfair” and represented a breach of anti-discrimination laws.
Ms Ayton told the commission that Mr Wang, who took over the store in 2016, had been “trying to get rid of me” because she was not Chinese.
During the case, commission deputy president Peter Sams conducted an internet search and found “a number of past job ­advertisements by Mr Wang on various Chinese Australian job forums”.
These posts listed the job requirements, with one stating “Asian Lady preferred” while another said, “Asian staff preferred”.
A third post said he “more preferred overseas people (sic)”.
Mr Wang sacked Ms Ayton via text message in April this year, later claiming it was due to her ­absences from work and alleged minor cash shortages ranging from $5.10 to $30 from the cash register.
But Mr Sams said Mr Wang’s reasons for sacking Ms Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She had been absent for just one shift in three years and the “shortages” amounted to a few dollars.
He said Ms Ayton’s dismissal was “not, in truth, related to her conduct or performance”.
“In my view, supported by the job advertisements posted by Mr Wang, the respondent’s real ­motive for dismissing her was Mr Wang’s preference to hire staff of Asian-speaking backgrounds,’’ he said.
“Mr Wang’s conduct constituted a breach of anti-discrimination laws and/or the ­applicant’s dismissal was for an unlawful reason, pursuant to s 772(f) of the (Fair Work) Act. ”
Mr Sams said he did not consider reinstatement appropriate given the “appalling” treatment of Ms Ayton by Mr Wang.
He will consider compensation to be paid to Ms Ayton, who was employed as a casual, earning $26 an hour.
Given the potential breaches of anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation, Mr Sams said he would send his decision and files to the commission general manager to consider whether Mr Wang’s conduct should be referred to other agencies to investigate potential state or commonwealth law breaches.
He said Ms Ayton was not given any opportunity by Mr Wang to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
“In my view, the respondent adopted a hopelessly unfair and biased process to dismiss the ­applicant, whereby Mr Wang ‘waited’ for an opportunity, which he believed would ‘justify’ terminating the employment of the ­applicant,’’ he said. ”
“He was mistaken … the ­respondent’s complete disregard in affording the applicant any natural justice when dismissing her was astounding for its brazen and appallingly perfunctory unfairness. ”
Mr Sams said while the Foodworks store was a small business “it must be bluntly said that no employer with any sense of common decency, would have effected a dismissal in the hopelessly unfair and perfunctory manner admitted to in this case. ”
He said that “it was disgraceful and grossly unfair. ”

Six people deny sale of fake Malaysian birth certificates, case to be heard by the High Court
Six men suspected of forging and selling passports, birth certificates, and identity cards, including an assistant director of the National Register of Names and a Dato-class businessman, went to court on Thursday; the district court judge approved the allegations of anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking in migrants, and the case was referred to the High Court.
Among them, the defense lawyer who originally represented the Dato-class Chinese defendant Li Zhenhua, also a member of the parliament of Jelutong, applied to the judge to withdraw from the trial on behalf of the case, that is, he would no longer be the defendant's representative lawyer, and this was approved in court.
He said that he had been criticized by political opponents for representing the defendant, and that his democratic action party was also implicated.
He emphasized that he was not afraid of any threats, but he did not want to be used by irresponsible entities to stigmatize the DAP and the Pakatan Harapan government or other Pakatan leaders, so the decision was made after careful consideration.
He also said that there was no conflict of interest between the defendant and his role as a member of Parliament, and that he was not legally prohibited from representing any of the defendants, and to date, the defendant Li Zhenhua has not been convicted.
The six defendants were charged in court on September 12 this year, and facing a number of charges against Article 26E of the Anti-Human Trafficking and Anti-Trafficking in Immigration Act and Article 466 of the Criminal Code (forged documents), they all pled not guilty, which were not approved by the court and are pending trial.
On Thursday, two district court judges, Noshaha and Mazlan, approved the prosecution's submission for transferring the six defendants’ charges against the Anti-Human Trafficking and Anti-Trafficking in Immigration Act to the High Court, and as for the allegations of falsification of documents, they will appear in the court on October 3, pending the prosecution's transfer of documents to the defense.
Earlier, the six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (SOSMA), and thus the judge did not grant bail.
Marching Together with the Motherland - A Sketch of a Certain Parade Unit of the People's Armed Police Force
On a training field for the military parade in this golden autumn, an armed police force formation composed of officers and soldiers with an average height of 1.83m was busy rehearsing.
Their shining bayonets and singular olive green and bright red shoulder boards jointly formed an eye-catching scene.
This journalist recently visited the unit, and deeply felt the armed police officers’ and soldiers’ determination to be loyal guardians of the Party and people forever, as well as their sentiment and their pursuit of “honor first”.
“The dream illuminates a splendid life, and authors an immortal miracle in the new era...” is the song written by the formation members - “Marching Together with the Motherland”.
This song was the motto of every member of the unit.
Qi Xiaoguang, at 1.92m tall, was particularly eye-catching in the formation.
As a flag bearer of the former National Flag Guard of the People's Armed Police, he understood the honors all the more deeply.
The honor of servicemen comes from bitter, difficult training.
As the flag bearer, Qi Xiaoguang always followed high standards and rigorous requirements of training.
He practiced his posture by binding sand bags on his legs, practiced the pace by setting a chronometer, practiced the step length by covering his eyes, and practiced stability in strong winds.
He considers one scene from his career as a flag bearer to be unforgettable.
A heavy rain came all of a sudden during a flag raising ceremony, but none of the tourists who came to watch the ceremony left.
At the moment when the national flag rose, Qi Xiaoguang deeply felt the honor represented by the five-starred Red Flag on his shoulders.
In 2019, Qi Xiaoguang was selected to take part in the military parade as a pacesetter.
The motion standards for the pacesetter and the flag bearer are different.
The marching step frequencies of the flag bearer and the pacesetter have a difference of just over 20 steps, but he still had to make greater efforts in his training, according to Qi Xiaoguang.
The pacesetter is the first in the first row, and directly determines the uniformity of the entire formation.
After intensive training for the military parade began, he practiced kicking his legs every day, and finally succeeded.
During a demo, his accurate step length and pace won successive applause from his teammates.
Almost every officer and soldier in the formation feels the same as Qi Xiaoguang.
The father of soldier Zhu Xudong participated in the military parade in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the New China 20 years ago.
To follow in the steps of his father and become a formation member, he suffered one setback after another, but he never lost heart.
He said, “It is the greatest honor of my life to march across Tian’anmen Square, and accept the inspection of the Party and people as my father did, so I am willing to bear any hardship. ”
When entering the unit’s Honor Room, this journalist first saw an eight-character banner - “Elite Force Keeps the Stability of the Capital”.
Political Commissar Wang Qian from the unit said that all members come from the People's Armed Police Beijing Corps - a group that takes pride in its glorious traditions, and that has taken on many significant tasks, including the founding ceremony of the New China, past National Day celebrations, security at Party National Congresses, anti-terrorist fighting, and stability maintenance in the capital, it has produced many personal and collective heroes, and more than 50 units and individuals have received honorary titles conferred by the State Council, the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, and the People’s Armed Police Force.

Song Tao, chief engineer of the shaft working area in the DaRui project department of the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, said, "The successful tunneling of the main shaft of Gaoligong Tunnel No. 1 to the end will help to promote the construction of the vehicle yard at the bottom of the construction well, open multiple working faces for later construction and the horizontal guide, and will speed up the construction progress of the whole Gaoligong Tunnel. "
Song Tao explained that the drilling method for the construction of the No. 1 shaft of the Gaoligong Tunnel used a large-scale drilling derrick, a drilling stable car, a drilling winch, an integral mobile metal formwork, an FJD-6A umbrella drill, and a central rotary rock grab, so specialized machinery has formed a "four-in-one" mechanized assembly line such as a mechanized excavation system, lifting system, suspension system, and winch hoisting system, realizing the mechanization of the entire process of drilling, blasting, excavation, formwork installation, and concrete pouring operation, which greatly accelerated the construction schedule.
It is learned that the DaRui Railway runs from Dali in the east to Ruili in the west and has a total length of about 331 kilometers and a design speed of 140 kilometers per hour.
The Gaoligong Tunnel is 34.538 kilometers long and is the longest tunnel of China's railway.
The TV series “Hunting” reproduces the demeanor of front-line police detectives
The criminal investigation TV series “Hunting”, which covers the transnational pursuit of fugitives, was recently filmed at Tianjin Airport, in which actors such as Wang Kai, Wang Ou, and others performed key scenes such as escorting fugitive economic suspects back to China, and the production of which was supported by China Southern Airlines.
The “Hunting” crew filmed the key scene at the airport that best demonstrates the achievements of “Hunting Action” - members of the Hunting team brought fugitives back to China, escorted them off the plane, and signed arrest warrants.
The crew took shots of the tarmac, crossing points, aircraft cabins, and hatch doors, recreating the arduous journey and professional demeanor of China's front-line economic police detectives and hunting heroes who cross over many nations to arrest fugitive criminals.
To complete shooting, the creative team did a lot of early preparatory work and repeatedly confirmed every detail to ensure that the most authentic and striking visual effects could finally be achieved.
It is reported that the TV series will also be filmed in many places abroad.
Vietnam should seize the opportunity for the development of artificial intelligence.
The four criteria used to evaluate and rank the level of cities' readiness for the AI wave include prospects, realization ability, asset base, and development direction.
Singapore ranks first, followed by cities in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an organization expert, responded to the reporter's interview for Maxine Pewana, "When reviewing and evaluating cities such as Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, I found it meaningful.
In general, I believe that Vietnam's future is very bright in light of its high growth rates, strong economic development strategy, and rapid talent building.
I think Vietnam is on the right path and doing a good job.
It is important that Vietnam knows how to use the opportunities brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to promote more economic development. "
Artificial intelligence is completely changing the way people work, communicate, and live.
It brings greater efficiency, but it also generates the threat of exacerbating social, economic, and technological inequality.
However, according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman, only any city in the world today is ready for the breakthrough brought about by the era of artificial intelligence.

The approximately 800 million tourist trips during the National Day holiday reflects booming demand and supply in Chinese tourism industry
There will be approximate 800 million tourist trips taken in the upcoming “National Day” golden week.
Big data from a number of tourism platforms shows that China's tourism consumption market is booming in terms of both supply and demand.
Ctrip’s National Day tourism report predicts that, based on previous National Day tourism statistics, it is expected that the number of domestic tourist trips during the National Day holidays this year will be close to 800 million, and the number of overseas tourist trips will exceed 7.5 million.
Currently, tourists from more than 500 cities have booked package tours, self-guided tours, customized tours, local entertainment, and other products through the platform in 100 countries and regions.
According to the estimate of the China Tourism Academy, the country received 726 million domestic tourist trips during the National Day holidays last year, a year-on-year increase of 9.43%.
This year’s National Day holiday will not only see a new high in the number of tourists, but also witness consumption upgrade as the "theme" of trips taken.
Ctrip’s report says that the average cost of domestic cross-provincial trips during the National Day holidays is more than RMB 3,000 yuan per person, up from the same period last year, which is because tourists generally choose products with a better user experience, such as higher-rated brand hotels, no-shopping tours, customized small group tours, exclusive vehicles, and exclusive guides.
Booking data from lvmama.com shows a similar trend: "private tours" of less than 10 people in comfortable vehicles for the whole journey for long-distance trips are more popular this year than in previous years.
Data of springtour.com shows that its consumers prefer "leisurely and slow travel" focused on experience, service, and differentiation.
Fliggy’s data indicates the number of tourist bookings in China's fourth-tier cities and below has grown fastest, with a year-on-year growth rate of 30%, reflecting the upgrading of residents' consumption in more regions in China.
Personalization is a major feature of this year's "National Day" golden week tourism.
Ctrip’s data reveal that the vehicle rental road trip orders during the National Day holidays are expected to increase by nearly 60% year on year, and as short-distance self-driving travels to explore surrounding niche routes continue to be touted, those ordering private tours will increase by 155% year on year.
To share happiness has become the main purpose of travel and leisure.
According to Ctrip, 28% of tourists during the National Day holidays are parents and children, 25% are couples, and 23% are colleagues and friends.
As for the age of tourists, those born in the 1980s and 1990s account for more than half of the total.
It is worth noting that even though outbound tourism grew faster in previous golden weeks, this year's inbound tourism market performance is more "eye-catching".
According to Fliggy’s data, the number of people booking inbound cultural and tourism routes during the National Day holidays this year has increased by 42% compared with the same period last year, growing faster than outbound tourism.
An industry analysis shows that while demand is high, the reform of the tourism supply side all over the country provides tourists with more abundant "grand cultural and tourism banquets".
For example, the General Administration of Sport and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism have jointly released the "2019 National Day Golden Week Quality Routes for Sports Tourism", the ongoing 2019 Shanghai Tourism Festival has launched 100 cultural and tourism activities in 7 sectors to attract Chinese and foreign tourists, and as the golden week approaches, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong, and other provinces have reduced the price or exempt tickets to their scenic spots.
Ctrip’s booking data shows that destinations with unique natural scenery or cultural features in China are the most popular, and that Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xi 'an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Tianjin will be the most popular domestic destinations.

The world's oldest hairdresser dies at 108, has cut hair for 96 years
Anthony Mancinelli, the world's oldest hairdresser in New York, USA, certified by King ’s World Records as 108 years old, has never retired, and diligently cut his guests’ hair every day, however, he died of mandibular cancer complications and bid farewell to his 96-year life of hair cutting.

Listed company repurchase scale hits record high of over 100 billion yuan during the year—Xinhuanet
In order to stabilize company stock price and maintain the company's image, listed companies have frequently repurchased shares in the past two years; through directional repo, collective bidding, and other means, companies hope to send the message that the company's value is underestimated to the market, thereby stabilizing the stock price and enhancing investor confidence.
Data from Oriental Fortune Choice shows that the funds used by listed companies to repurchase shares were 7.9 billion yuan in 2017, and soared to 51 billion yuan in 2018, and since 2019, the total amount of A-share listed companies' repurchase implementation has exceeded 100 billion yuan, setting a new record for the amount of funds for A-share repurchases, and far exceeding previous years.
From the perspective of the purpose of repurchasing, the repurchased shares of companies and the increase in major shareholders seem to be the same, but there are great differences in implementation, capital sources, repurchase purposes, and stock equity.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Maikerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said in an interview with Securities Daily that the Opinions on Supporting Listed Companies to Repurchase Shares, issued in November 2018, has repaired the problems with the previously existing system, such as the narrow scope of share repurchases, complicated decision-making procedures, and inadequate inventory systems, and stated that because listed companies have been encouraged to repurchase shares through policy, the phenomenon of repurchasing shares increased significantly that year.
In January of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange formally issued the Implementation Rules for Listed Companies Repurchasing Shares, the introduction of which has broadened the sources of repurchase funds of listed companies, appropriately simplified implementation procedures, guided and improved governance arrangements, and encouraged all kinds of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee stock ownership plans.
After the publication of the regulation, share repurchasing by listed companies is applicable in more situations, the repurchase process is simpler, and there is greater enthusiasm for share repurchases.
Buying back shares at a relatively low position is also beneficial to improve the efficiency of capital use for listed companies, so as to increase the level of earnings per share, improve the return on equity, and reduce the pressure on the profitability index of the companies.
Compared with the shareholding increase of major shareholders, it is more meaningful for listed companies to buy back shares, and it also reflects the willingness to conduct active market value management and the abundant cash flow of listed companies.
Xu Yang believes that the main factor in buybacks by the listed companies is the undervaluation of share prices; the share price of companies doesn’t reflect the companies’ future development prospects, so such companies deserve investors' attention, but can’t be invested in blindly, meaning that it is required to focus on the financial reports and the specific operating conditions of such listed companies.
Listed companies with massive buybacks at least show the development confidence and capital strength of the companies.
The buyback enthusiasm of A-share listed companies is heating up, which is normalizing buybacks; data shows that there are nearly a thousand listed companies that have implemented share buybacks this year, and the leading companies in all walks of life have become the main force in the repurchase market.
In the process of its recent disclosure on buyback progress, Ping An stated that the company has already bought back 57.59 million A-shares, accounting for 0.315% of the company's total capital stock by centralized bidding transactions, with RMB 5 billion of total funds paid (excluding transaction costs); the repurchased shares will all be used for the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, including but not limited to the long-term service plan that has been reviewed and approved by the general meeting of shareholders.
Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group has paid RMB 5.792 billion for share repurchases, and recently adjusted the use of repurchased share, which will be changed from the original plan, “all repurchased shares will be used as the stock source for implementation of stock equity incentive in the future” to “it is to repurchase 183 million shares in total, of which 152 million shares can be used as the stock source for implementation of stock equity incentive, and the remaining 30.49 million shares can be used for writing off to reduce registered capital”.
Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group expressed that writing off part of the repurchased shares would be in favor of further increasing the level of earnings per share and effectively improving the return on investment for company shareholders.
The notice on repurchase progress issued by the TCL Group on September 25 showed that TCL Group had repurchased 3.59% of the shares of the company in total, at a total cost of RMB 1.65 billion.
The office of the board of the TCL Group told the reporters of Securities Daily that repurchased shares would be used for the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, equity incentives, or converting corporate bonds issued by listed companies that can be converted into stocks.
The TCL Group has insisted on its existing business strategy, continuously improved its competitiveness, and developed steadily and healthily.
On the basis of confidence in the company’s future development and the maintenance of investor interests, the company plans to repurchase shares of the company using its own funds, self-raised funds, and other means of financing, combined with the performance of the secondary market of the company's shares over the past year, and taking the business condition and financial condition of the company and other factors into consideration.
Yang Delong, chief economist of First Seafront Fund, said that on one hand, listed companies buying back shares could reduce the number of shares circulating in the market and increase the earnings per share of the listed companies, which would be an important factor in favor of the stock price in the secondary market; on the other hand, the listed companies were willing to put up money proactively to repurchase the shares from the stock market for writing off, which greatly boosted market confidence.
The repurchase of domestic listed companies has been increasing in recent years, especially among blue chips, and it is both a good way to boost investor confidence by repurchasing shares and a practice worthy of affirmation and encouragement.
Hu Henghua, member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and Secretary of the Changsha Municipal Party Committee, and the four leaders of construction machinery manufacturing in Hunan Province - Zhan Chunxin, Liang Wengen, He Qinghua, and Liu Feixiang, around the theme "Changsha changes from construction machinery to intelligent manufacturing", have established a “small goal” - build the construction machinery industry cluster to a globally leading level within 3-5 years.
To build a globally leading construction machinery industry cluster in Changsha is, in modern terms, to build an "invincible industry".
As an inland provincial capital city, what gives Changsha the courage to declare such ambitions?
It comes from domineering and abundant strength.
The four Hunan construction machinery enterprises participating in the dialogue are powerful companies whose business covers all fields of sky, earth, sea and land; for example, the light aircraft of Sunward Intelligent, the concrete delivery pump of Zoomlion Heavy Industry, the all-terrain crane of Sany Heavy Industry, and the tunnel shield machine of Railway Construction Heavy Industry, provide "hard power" that are preeminent and unparalleled in the world.
There was a time when China had little say in the field of construction machinery.
But there have been rapid changes over time, and by adhering to the dual strategies of “bring in” and “go out”, alongside the drive provided by the One Belt and One Road Initiative, and by carrying out acquisitions, mergers, plant establishment, and other actions at the same time, Chinese enterprises have become leaders in the global construction machinery industry.
Among them, the output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators of companies like Sany Heavy Industry, Zoomlion Heavy Industry, Railway Construction Heavy Industry, Sunward Intelligent, and other leading construction machinery enterprises have been significantly ahead of similar enterprises.
This relies on the ability to seize opportunities.
The four leading Hunan construction machinery enterprises are the best in the construction machinery industry cluster in Changsha, and also leaders in the global construction machinery industry.
In the global industrial environment, whoever survives and operates well, has the authority to speak confidently.
In the early years, the global construction machinery industry suffered a bitter winter, and many internationally renowned construction machinery manufacturing enterprises collapsed, but the construction machinery manufacturing enterprises in Changsha went for “winter swim” instead of trying to escape the winter; they pressured themselves, achieved original breakthroughs, and have transitioned from manufacturing to smart manufacturing through the transformation of industrial structure, and so have not only survived, but also become more robust.
This is all thanks to the joint effort of governments and enterprises.
To develop competitive industries requires both enterprises to be aggressive and the government to be proactive.
Changsha has gained the reputation of "the capital of construction machinery" because it has converged the whole industrial chain, both upstream and downstream, created many correlative industrial clusters, and lowered the costs of research, development, manufacturing, and sales for enterprises by optimizing the business environment, improving supporting services, simplifying the approval process, and taking other measures to streamline administration, delegate powers, strengthen regulation, and improve services.
This good business environment has attracted a large number of construction machinery manufacturing enterprises.
The tide of history has propelled Changsha to the forefront of building the world's leading level of construction machinery, and it is time to act and to make every effort to move ahead.
Whether government, enterprises, or even relevant linked fields including industry, universities, research, and business, all should seize and take advantage of the opportunity, keep firm objectives, strive persistently, and contribute Hunan‘s efforts to the building of a manufacturing powerhouse.
Wang Yi Presided over the Foreign Ministers' Meeting between China and African Members of the United Nations Security Council.
Wang Yi expressed that China and African countries are good brothers and partners.
China has always stood firmly with its African brothers, in the past as it does in the present and will in the future.
We advocate the holding of this Foreign Ministers' Meeting as a specific measure for implementing the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and the leaders of African countries at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in September of last year for enhancing solidarity and cooperation between China and African countries at the Security Council and for pushing the international community to provide better support to Africa to achieve peace and development.
Wang Yi said that Africa is China’s most important and most trusted partner.
As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China’s vote on the Security Council has always belonged to the world’s many developing countries, including African countries.
Faced with the new situation, China is ready to work with African countries on the Security Council to strengthen solidarity and coordination and to safeguard common interests.
The two sides should grow strong through solidarity, resolve disputes through consultation, be self-reliant, and consider development to be the fundamental solution to problems.
The foreign ministers of the African countries who attended the meeting extended their congratulations on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
They said that Africa-China relations are based on equality and mutual respect, and that Africa and China have always been each other's most reliable partners.
Africa appreciates that China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has played an important and positive role in African affairs, effectively promoted the fair and reasonable settlement of African issues, and made great contributions to safeguarding African interests and boosting peace and security in Africa.
At present, Africa faces the threat of terrorism and extremism, and only by addressing these security issues can Africa truly achieve long-term peaceful development.
They expected to further coordinate with China and strengthen solidarity and cooperation on the Security Council.
Wang said that an important consensus was reached at the meeting.
All parties were supportive of safeguarding multilateralism, strengthening the authority and role of the United Nations, upholding the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and opposing unilateralism and bullying; all agreed to enhance mutual support and cooperation between China and Africa in UN and Security Council affairs, and to safeguard the common interests of China, Africa, and other developing countries; furthermore, it was supported by all that African countries should resolve African issues in the African way, and that the UN should provide financial support for independent peace operations in Africa; the concept of “cooperation for development and development for peace” was also supported by all, which will help African countries achieve independent and sustainable development, and all parties at the meeting were firmly committed to safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries, as well as opposing any country creating obstacles for developing countries or depriving them of the right to development.
Qingyang, Gansu Province: Hu sheep provided “experience of eliminating poverty”.
The beauty of September in autumn is draped over the loess plateau.
In the Yimin Breeding Specialized Cooperative in Yima Town, after filling up the food trough in the sheepfold with the last shovelful of forage, Xia Weili, a 58 year old villager, stayed by the trough and watched the white Hu sheep chew carefully.
“Only when Hu sheep eat more forage, when they get fat in autumn and winter, do they sell at a good price. "
Xia Weili said he feeds the sheep “a special nutritious meal” every day, cleans and disinfects regularly, and served them carefully without neglect.
Xia Weili has raised sheep for over 20 years, but it was not until he came to work in the cooperative that he knew how extensive sheep herding used to be.
Xia Weili is from Xialaochi Village, Yima Town, Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His neighbors were all sheep farmers, but they stuck to traditional free-range breeding, so the quality of sheep was poor, and slaughter capacity was low.
Under government guidance, 140 households in poverty in the village joined the cooperative this June, and then everything began to change.
Xia Weili delved into breeding all day long, because he had a belief in his heart.
The people who became shareholders were all poor households, and the sheep were all in trust to the cooperative, so everyone was counting on to deliver good dividends and sell the sheep at a good price.
Thanks to the guidance of technicians, he gradually learned how to carry out epidemic prevention, mastered scientific feeding, and became one of the few “skilled hands” in feeding in the village.
The Yimin Breeding Specialized Cooperative is a standardized cooperative with a total of 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1400 Hu sheep.
Zou Tao, the head of the cooperative, said that there were things to keep in mind both inside and outside the standardized sheep sheds.
“The wool is so thick that it easily breeds bacteria, so Hu sheep can't stay in hot, dark, and damp places, which means sheep sheds must be built in a place surrounded on three sides by ditches, and ventilators also had to be installed for ventilation and heat dissipation. "
Zou Tao said that in order to carry out epidemic prevention, the sheep sheds need to be regularly disinfected by spraying, and that the sheep should be vaccinated three to four times a quarter.
Besides living well, “little sheep” not only need to eat forage mixed with silage corn, wheat straw, alfalfa, and other plants, but also need a wide enough “playground” to stretch their muscles and bones.
The cooperative uses trusteeship to guide local farmers in raising, managing, and uniformly selling well-bred Hu-sheep here, so as to achieve the breeding of improved varieties, scientific handling, standardization, and intensification.
At present, the 140 poor households with shares in the sheep can gain over RMB 6,000 per household every year, among which 4 registered and filed farmers in poverty work in the cooperative.
From “grazing all over the mountain” to “feeding accurately”, from “mating locally” to “artificial insemination”, from “observing body shape and touching bellies” to “doing B-mode ultrasound one by one”…in Qingyang, Gansu Province, mutton sheep breeding not only changes feeding patterns, the mode of “leading enterprise + cooperative + farmer” has also changed the former condition of “breeding sheep on the hillside and selling them in the market”, overcome the weakness, small size and scattered nature of traditional agriculture and animal husbandry, meaning the impoverished condition of these farmers is improving because of modern sheep breeding.
Zou Tao said that if the market price is weak, Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., a local leading enterprise, feels confident in purchasing the sheep at a guaranteed market price of RMB 27 per kilogram to help farmers absorb market risks.
Xu Jianfeng, General Counsel of Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., said that the enterprise has driven more and more poor households to practice “sheep breeding” by providing poor households with services such as loan guarantees, supplying breeding sheep, breeding against order, quotation and purchase, and processing and uniform sales.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have achieved stable income increases by “joining in” forage farming, stock breeding, large-scale breeding, slaughter segmentation, and marketing thanks to Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd.
Qingyang City is located in the northern farming pastoral ecozone, and has rich forage resources.
At present, there are 913 large-scale mutton sheep farms and cooperatives in the city, with over 5 million mutton sheep raised, and two processing lines with the capacity to slaughter 1.3 million sheep have been built, so sheep are becoming the “leader” of industry poverty alleviation in the area.
The French Finance Minister said the tax reduction would exceed 10 billion euros in the next year and called on Germany to follow up.
Reuters in Paris on September 26 -- French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros (10.9 billion USD) next year and said that Germany should keep pace with French fiscal stimulus to revive a floundering economy.
When introducing France’s 2020 budget, Bruno Le Maire said that the latest monetary easing measures of the European Central Bank have created an opportunity for those member governments with sufficient finances to increase investment.
The European Central Bank cut interest rates to a record low on September 12 and plans to restart bond purchases to reduce borrowing cost, thus hoping to stimulate economic recovery and push up the inflation rate.
“Low interest rates will not make Europe prosperous, and monetary policy measures are necessary, but not enough,” Bruno Le Maire told reporters.
“Germany needs investment and needs it now, the sooner the better. Don’t wait until the situation gets worse,” he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany many times.
France has implemented a tax reduction of more than 10 billion euros this year, which has greatly boosted France’s economic growth.
The global economy has lost momentum, and the Germany economy, which depends on exports, has borne the brunt.
Bruno Le Maire indicated that the tax burden on French families will be reduced by 9.3 billion euros next year, including deductions from income taxes of 5 billion euros.
In addition, with the gradual implementation of reducing the corporate tax rate from 33.3 percent to 25 percent, the tax burden on enterprises will be reduced by nearly 1 billion euros.

Research: US national healthy eating index increases slightly but challenges remain - http://www.chinanews.com/
www.chinanews.com, September 27 According to www.uschinapress.com, the latest research in the United States reveals a moderate increase in the US government's healthy eating index over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58.
However, on a scale of 100, there is not much to celebrate.
Americans still face "significant challenges" in their diet.
Dr. Fangfang Zhang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts, and one of the authors of the report, said Americans still eat too much food that could lead to heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and the other most common diseases among Americans.
The research was published on September 24th in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
It was based on health surveys of 44,000 adults by the U.S. government between 1999 and 2016.
The authors wrote, "Despite the considerable improvements, significant challenges remain in our diets."
The challenges include getting Americans to limit snacks, hot dogs, beef fat, butter, and other foods that contain saturated fat.
The research found that daily intake of unhealthy fat increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended limit of 10%.
The biggest improvement in the American diet was reduction in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but it’s still too high.
The authorities say the daily intake of added sugar should be less than 10%.
The researchers thought the reason for the decrease in sugar intake is drinking less sweetened soda, but Dr. Zhang emphasized that sugar is often also added to foods that are not very sweet, such as yogurt and ketchup.
American adults ate slightly more fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole grain foods.
However, the data in 2016 shows that these foods still made up less than 5% of the American diet.
Although people ate slightly less salt and drank less fruit juice, resulting in the intake of low quality carbohydrate, Dr. Zhang said these still accounted for up to 42% of daily calories, and much came from processed white bread and other refined grains.
The research is based on personal health surveys once every two years that ask adults to recall what they ate in the past 24 hours.
The health surveys have put up the question twice every few days since 2003.
The government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend "healthy eating patterns" to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The Guidelines say people should eat more nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, as well as seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs, and seeds that provide protein.
During the research period, the number of Americans with diabetes has nearly doubled to more than 7%, and the obesity rate has increased over the years of the research - about 70% of American adults are now overweight or obese.
Moreover, heart disease is still the leading cause of death in the United States.
EU promotes strategic partnership with Asia
Ruan Wenping, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, and minister of the Central Ministry of Economic Affairs led a delegation to attend the forum.
According to the close cooperative relationship between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the forum set the theme as "The EU and Asia establish cooperation: building a bridge for a sustainable future".
The forum was held one year after the implementation of the cooperation strategy of the European Union between the two continents.
President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said that enhanced cooperation was part of the above-mentioned proposition because it benefitted the peoples and economies of the countries concerned.
The above-mentioned relationship helped bring stability and prosperity to all parties concerned.
He also believes that the EU wants to convey a message about increasing participation and consolidating the mutually beneficial relationship between Europe and Asia.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a special guest of the forum and will deliver an important speech at the plenary session.
China's first joint-stock bank financial management subsidiary established: empowering the asset management business with technology
On the 26th, Everbright Financial Co., LTD., a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Everbright Bank, was formally established in Qingdao, and is the first joint-stock bank financial management subsidiary established in China.
Experts said that asset management is an important area for the development of financial technology, and the establishment of financial management subsidiaries by banks is conducive to the use of technology to enhance the asset management business.
In April this year, China Everbright Bank and China Merchants Bank respectively issued announcements that they had been approved by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission to establish a financial management subsidiary.
On September 24, China Everbright Bank announced that China Everbright Financial Management was officially approved for the business.
In the next two days, China Everbright Bank led many joint-stock banks and took the lead in establishing China Everbright Financial Management in Qingdao.
Li Xiaopeng, Chairman of the Everbright Group, said that the Everbright Group will accelerate the pace of innovation, use thinking and the means provided by modern technology, rely on big data, the Internet of things, and cloud computing to improve the coverage, utilization, and penetration of financial capital, and improve customer perceptions, well-being, and security.
By the year 2021, China will establish and improve the "four beams and eight pillars" for the development of fintech, further enhance the technology application capability of the financial industry, realize the in-depth integration and coordinated development of finance and technology, and significantly enhance the people's satisfaction with digital, networked, and intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Xuyang, Chairman of Everbright Financial Management, explained that Everbright’s asset management platform would use technologies such as intelligent investment consulting, intelligent investment research, and big data to help Everbright Financial Management better judge the macroeconomic situation.
In the future, new technologies such as blockchain will also be applied to grasp the direction and trend of traditional and alternative assets, and then be extended to digital alternative assets.
Dong Ximiao, a specially-appointed researcher of the National Finance and Development Lab, said that under the new competition and co-operation situation facing the asset management industry, fintech companies and asset management institutions must jointly explore new growth paths with asset management technology.
Fintech empowers the asset management industry, which is not only the need for the transformation and development of Fintech itself, but also injects new vitality into the development of the asset management business.
Earlier this year, JD.com launched a new asset management technology system to improve the product development and risk control capabilities of asset management using technology and digital means.
The new system starts with the four major capabilities of product design, sales transactions, asset management, and risk assessment to improve the overall intelligent operation of the asset management industry.
Experts believe that while enhancing asset management capabilities and allowing rich product innovation, asset management technology can also enhance risk prevention capabilities and improve the efficiency of asset management.
Zhang Xuyang said that in the past, the risk preference of customers was easily biased through questionnaires, but now the use of artificial intelligence to conduct user portraiting helps better locate customers, and helps to launch products according to the customer's investment preference, which in turn helps to resolve risk.
"Alternative big data such as e-commerce and Spatio-temporal data can help us better characterize the activity and prosperity of a region and an industry. "
While defusing risks, big data technology will also help improve risk control, Zhang said.
There is a new record for the deepest railway tunnel shaft in China
China News Service, Baoshan, September 27th (Zhang Weiming, Xu Weiguo, Zhou Jingbo) After more than 1200 days and nights, digging and track-laying for the Dali-Ruili Railway’s No. 1 Shaft of Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel was completed on September 27th, at which point the shaft extended 762.59m under the surface, breaking the record for the deepest railway tunnel shaft in China, and this record was set despite the risk of a massive water burst.
The Dali-Ruili Railway’s Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel, located in Yunnan province is 34.5 km long in total, runs across the Gaoligong Mountains from the west bank of Nujiang River, and is the longest two-lane single-tube tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel runs through 19 fault zones and has a maximum depth of 1,155m, and due to the fact that it covers nearly all possible unfavorable geological conditions and major risks for tunnel construction, the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel is called the "geological museum" of tunnel construction.
The shaft is the most important service gallery for the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel, and is crucial to important tasks, including achieving "short tunneling time for long tunnels" work planes, and serving as permanent ventilation for later railway operations.
The successful excavation of No. 1 Shaft to the bottom marks the beginning of horizontal tunnel construction for Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel; when the shaft station is excavated and equipment is replaced, there will be 4 additional working planes at the bottom to speed the excavation of the main tunnel.
"The Shaft is entirely inside a granite formation, and there are many fractures in the granite formation, so there is no way to prevent the continuous flow of water from the top to the bottom, which is to say that essentially, the water pressure is the same as the depth of the shaft. "
Chief Engineer Si Jingzhao of the China Railway Tunnel Group Dali-Ruili Railway Project Team told this reporter that during shaft construction, sudden muddy water bursts were a common occurrence, causing the risk of collapse and other dangers, and that the builder invited experts to the site to diagnose and discuss countermeasures more than 20 times.
“The maximum water burst in the shaft is higher than 300 m3/h, and the shaft bottom is deeper than 700m, which means that the water pressure is equivalent to that 700m under the sea. "
Si said, "If we didn’t pump out and drain the water in time, the shaft would be flooded by 10 meters of water in an hour, which meant we spend almost 85% of our time in handling the water and just 15% actually tunneling. "
To overcome geological challenges at No. 1 Shaft, such as longitudinal joint development in the surrounding rock, sudden muddy water bursts, and water-rich granite, systematic water control measures which combined "water exploring, grouting, and tunneling" were adopted during tunnel construction to reduce construction risks.
After several improvements, a mechanized construction line including an excavation system, debris hauling system, suspension system, and winch hoisting system was developed for the construction of No. 1 Shaft to ensure whole-process mechanized operation including drilling, blasting, debris hauling, formwork installation, and concrete pouring, which accelerated the construction progress.
Finally, after more than 1200 days and nights, the shaft was successfully tunneled to a depth of 762.59m.
Dali-Ruili Railway is 330km long in total, and is an important part of the China-Myanmar international corridor, as well as an important “Belt and Road transportation infrastructure.
After it opens to traffic, the time to drive from Dali to Ruili will be shortened from the current 6 hours to 2 hours, which will greatly improve the transportation system in west Yunnan and facilitate economic and trade cooperation and friendly personnel exchanges between China and countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia.
Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor: As a Chinese Person, I’m Proud Of China’s Achievements
Hong Kong press circles celebrate the 70th anniversary of China’s founding.

“Over the past 70 years, China has always striven to move ahead and overcome difficulties, and has made numerous obvious achievements, and as a Chinese person, I am proud of these achievements,” said Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor.
Since its return to China, Hong Kong has continued to maintain a close connection with the mainland, and the two have made progress together and shared substantial achievements.
Under the premise of “one country, two systems”, Hong Kong will continue to play to its advantages, seize the opportunities offered by the “Belt and Road” and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and build a better future for Hong Kong.
She also said that Hong Kong has been increasingly been the subject of controversy over the past few months, that every Hong Kong resident is affected under such circumstances, and that journalists face unique challenges.
At this crucial moment, all those engaged in journalism should continue handling these difficulties in a hands-on manner, provide fair and impartial news in the spirit of professionalism, and play a part in building the future of Hong Kong and bringing society back to rational communication and dialogue.
New China’s splendid history is also Hong Kong’s journey of development and progress, as well as sharing weal or woe with the Mainland.
Especially since the return of Hong Kong to China, the central government has unwaveringly implemented the policies of “one country, two systems”, “Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong”, and a high degree of autonomy, and as such, Hong Kong and the mainland will continue to work together with one heart, and will help and support each other to create win-win miracles of economic development.
For this purpose, those in Hong Kong’s journalism industry gathered here to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
He said that in the past three months, a series of violent activities that break the law and destabilize society have occurred in Hong Kong, and some media have released false news which distorts the facts and fuels the violence.
He called upon the media to eliminate vice and exalt virtue, thereby creating a good environment where all citizens can jointly fight against violence and uphold the rule of law.
Media professionals should abide by the professional norms of journalism, and should guide citizens to consciously reject violence and maintain the law by releasing honest reports and responsible remarks.
About 500 people from Hong Kong’s press circles and all walks of life attended the reception, where together with the officiating guests, they proposed a toast to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
The reporter learned from the Publicity Department of the Xining Municipal Committee that Xining will implement the Xining Civilized Behavior Promotion Regulations from October 1st, which focus on 15 types of uncivilized behavior, such as pedestrians who do not follow the traffic lights and throw objects from buildings, so a list of key management will be made and corresponding penalties will be set.
Wang Shengbin, deputy director of the Publicity Department of the Xining Municipal Committee and director of the Municipal Civilization Office, explained that since Xining was awarded the title of National Civilized City in 2017, the civilization and moral standards of Xining citizens have improved significantly.
However, uncivilized behaviors such as pedestrians jaywalking, running red lights, and non-motorized vehicles not following traffic lights; throwing objects at height and Windows; smoking in public places, dog walking in public places, and laissez-faire defecation are still very prominent and easy to rebound, which should be resolved as soon as possible.
The Regulations, combining the reality of Xining, put forward more comprehensive and higher standards for the civilized code of conduct for individuals and units from public places, public order, public facilities, public environmental sanitation, civilized travel, civilized tourism, civilized Internet access, civilized campus construction, promotion of civilized family construction, execution of official duties, commemoration of heroes and martyrs, medical services, etc., so that the whole society can understand what it can do, what it advocates, and what it prohibits.
“Formulating regulations to eliminate blind spots and misunderstandings in the field of civilized behavior cognition, and comprehensively regulate citizens' behavior, housekeeping, dining, travel, education, tourism, Internet access, green living, wedding and funeral services etc., will provide a strong legal guarantee for the normalization of mass spiritual civilization in Xining city. "
said Qiu Huaijun, secretary general of the Standing Committee of the Xining People's Congress.

A British Family Stuck in France for 5 Days Due to Car Keys Lost in a Lake
Recently, a couple with two children went to France for a holiday from Wales, but lost their car keys in a lake and they had to wait there for a new key from the automaker, which took 5 days.
Afterward, the family was finally able to leave France.
It is reported that on September 16, local time, a British family was visiting a lake in France, and their daughter accidentally knocked over their bag, dropping the car key from the bag into the lake.
They spent hours looking for the key, but failed to find it.
Worse, all their belongings and cash were locked in the car.
They had purchased insurance before departure, but the insurance company refused to give any compensation because their car was not at risk of being stolen.
Out of frustration, they called a tow truck and had their car taken to a garage, and then ordered a new key from the automaker.
A few days later, the British tourists finally received the new key and left France.
However, their tour reservations were cancelled due to the loss of the key.

Tourists must prepare medical insurance covering Saudi Arabia and provide an address in Saudi Arabia to apply.
Tourists can apply for the visa at the airport after landing, or apply for the electronic visa at visa.visitsaudi.com.
Of these, the electronic visa is a multiple entry visa with one year validity, which allows tourists to stay up to 90 days.
For ordinary tourists, Saudi Arabia is a very mysterious country because this country has never issued tourist visas.
In recent years, Saudi Arabia has promoted the “Vision 2030” plan under the leadership of Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed Ben Salman, which aims to reduce the country’ s long-term dependence on oil, and of which opening up tourism and the development of tourism are important components.

Survey on consumption in “National Day” holiday: More diverse tourism modes are becoming the foremost choice.
As the National Day holiday approaches, people's holiday plans are gradually being finalized.
This reporter of Securities Daily investigated the arrangements for the “National Day” holiday in Wechat Moments in the last few days, and according to feedback from nearly 20 people, although plans differ, “tourism + consumption” has become the key word for the “National Day” holiday.
Specifically speaking, from the feedback obtained by the reporter of Securities Daily, over half of the people are choosing to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said “he plans to travel to Shanghai with his family during the ‘National Day’ holiday, first to Disneyland, and then travel to the surrounding cities”; Miss Li from Beijing chose to travel to Taiwan in our country, “My family of three plans to leave on September 28 to take 10-day tour around Taiwan”; Miss Ma from Chongqing plans to travel abroad, with Singapore as the destination; Mr. Zhang from Hebei plans a road trip with his family, and said that, “My daughter is less than 2 years old, so it isn’t convenient to go on a long journey, which is why we plan to drive to Shandong to spend a few days by the seaside ”.
The Report on Residents Travel and Travel Trends in 2019 National Day Golden Week, jointly issued by Tongcheng Yilong and LY recently showed that the consumption upgrading trend of journeys and travel in the three subdivisions including trips, residence, and travel during the National Day Golden Week of this year is evident.
The rate of travelling by air and high-speed rail has increased steadily, and the proportion of the demand for starred hotels and individualized non-standard accommodation has increased.
The Report on Residents Travel and Travel Trends in 2019 National Day Golden Week issued by Meituan on September 23 showed that travel consumption continued to be vigorous, and that “eating, living, travelling, and playing” diversification and upgrades are appearing.
Much more young people prefer high-quality and unique experiences, and the popularity of cultural tourism, night tourism, and other tourism continues to rise rapidly.
Besides tourism, all kinds of demand for consumption were also stimulated during the National Day holiday.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the reporter of Securities Daily, “My main plan in this year’s ‘National Day’ holiday is to buy a car. "
The staff in a Beijing automobile brand 4S shop told the reporter of Securities Daily that generally speaking, September and October every year are known as the golden period of car sales.
During National Day, the shop holds many activities, such as prize drawings and discounts for visiting the shop.
In addition, many brands have launched new car models recently and it is expected that the new cars will significantly increase sales volume.
Amidst the trend of consumption upgrading, people pay more attention to meeting the demands for “the spirit”, and the ratio of the service consumption in culture, education, and other aspects is increasing.
“Since the birth our child, culture and education consumption have become the major portion of our family’s consumption expenditure”, Miss Du, who lives in Beijing, said.
This year’s ‘National Day’ holiday is well arranged, we will go to 'visit' planetarium, children's theater, meet with a few families to go to Elk Museum to put up tent for camping on the weekend, and also arrange some experience classes. "
In the opinions of some insiders, theoretically, residents' consumption upgrading has evolved from survival consumption to development consumption, and finally to enjoyment consumption, of which a large amount of enjoyment consumption falls under service consumption.
With the continuous development of our country’s economy and society, and the rising of residents' income level, people have higher demands for “spiritual” consumption, and traveling and taking trips is a good way to meet that demand.
In particular, people have enough time during the long “National Day” holiday, so people are more willing to travel and consume, which not only meet the demand for “spiritual” consumption, but also reflect the upgrading of residents' consumption.
I started feeling lonely in the afternoon, and I didn’t want to go out... I’m still not used to the fact that children aren’t around.
Pulling myself together, I said to my dog Nana, "Mom's taking you out.”
I wrote down a few things I had to do when I left home; my Type A blood personality traits were getting stronger, and I felt awkward as well.
Get a suit, buy nutritional grain, pay my bills, and buy sashimi and snacks for Nana.
All these were the reasons to go out.
I said to sister Aiqiang on the phone just now that without Nana, I wouldn’t even have the excuse to buy snacks.
Laughing perfunctorily, she said her child was calling and hung up.
Nana hopped up to the passenger seat and lay restfully, she knew she gets carsick, and she was terrified, but she didn’t want to be without me.
My husband, Boau, returned unusually early.
He said that the salmon with avocado salad was quite delicious, and then went to the bedroom lying on the bed watching TV.
I looked at the clock on the wall, and it was exactly 7 o'clock; in the land of the sunrise, the sun sets early, and it was dark already.
My Moments was full of pictures of bright moon, and I realized that today was Mid-Autumn Festival.
I washed a bunch of grapes from a friend and left half of them for Boau, put the rest in my favorite flower bowl, and took them outside to admire the moon.
Sitting on the ground with Nana, I ate the grapes and she ate the skins, and I spat the seeds away.
The moon was hiding in the clouds, but fortunately, the clouds were moving and the moon flickered, light and then dark, slightly piercing my eyes.
My mind was flooded with all kinds of poems about the moon, but the only verse I could remember clearly was this one: every fifteenth day of the lunar calendar month, there is a full moon at night, and with moonlight shining on the barriers, the moon had just appeared in the sky, and the people were looking up.
Maybe we think too much about the moon, and for this moment, the sentence of "the things of god belong to god, and the things of Caesar to Caesar" feels perfect.
The moonlight belongs to the moon, your mood to yourself.
After eating the grapes, I felt the chill of the cold moon.
Curling up at my feet, Nana snored slightly, so I got up and spread Nana's little blanket over the edge of her little nest, after which she happily laid down on it.
I opened the door and shouted: is the bath water ready?
I couldn’t see the moon from the bathroom window, I could only feel it, so I turned off the bathroom light and opened the glass window.
No moon cakes, no wine.

Chinese students can apply for German undergraduate courses based on their college entrance examination scores from next year
Recently, the Anabin Database in Germany, which is responsible for the assessment and certification of foreign academic qualifications, announced on its website that, from 2020, Chinese high school graduates can apply for German university undergraduate courses directly based on their college entrance examination scores, without having to register at a domestic university in advance.
Previously, Chinese high school graduates who want to apply to a German university had to study for one semester (university under 211 and 985 projects) or three semesters (ordinary undergraduate university) in China and pass the APS or TestAS exams.
The new rules could save at least half a year for Chinese students who want to study in Germany.
It is understood that the new rules will take effect in the second half of 2019.
Applicants should satisfy with the following requirements: complete 12 years of formal compulsory education and obtain a high school graduation certificate; take the unified examination and the college entrance examination and score 70% or above (if the total score is 750, a score of more than 525 is required) including the results of two languages and math or natural science, and other requirements.
However, the requirements of specific majors for the college entrance examination results are different.
For example, to apply for medical science, oral medicine, veterinary medicine, pharmacology, and other majors, the score of the college entrance examination should be 80% of the total or above, including at least two subjects in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, or the applicant should take the science subject synthesis examination; to apply for a law-related major, the score of the college entrance examination should be 80% of the total score or above, including at least two subjects of foreign language, history, geography, or the applicant should take the liberal art synthetic examination.
According to incomplete statistics, many countries, including Germany, Britain, Canada, and Australia, have recognized Chinese college entrance examination scores.
In the UK, for example, the University of Cambridge, the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester, and other colleges and universities accept applications from Chinese students based on their college entrance examination scores.
Military "robotic dog" take performance classes first Cirque du Soleil: inclusion in performance considered
The U.S. military has funded a "robot dog" for the battlefield, but its first appearance may be on the circus stage!
Cirque du Soleil said recently that it is in contact with Boston Dynamics, which develops robots, to discuss the feasibility of robots for use in circus performances.
According to a comprehensive foreign media report, Boston Dynamics announced a "Four-legged Robot Spot" promotional video on the 24th, which shows that Spot is an agile mobile robot that can carry 14kg, and has motility that is highly adaptive to off-road terrain, 360-degree obstacle avoidance, navigation, remote control, and autonomy.
In particular, Spot has a dedicated software platform developed exclusively for it so users can set Spot robot functions through various applications.
Boston Dynamics first published the idea of the robot dog in 1992, which caused a sensation at the time, but has not yet put it into commercial use.
However, Boston Dynamics pointed out that Spot has now entered mass production, and most of its subscribers were construction and energy companies.
In addition, Cirque du Soleil is currently in contact with Boston Dynamics, and Cirque du Soleil said the project was still in the concept stage and they were evaluating the potential of Spot for use in live performances.

Will MCA participate in the Parliamentary by-election of Tanjong Piai, Johor?
MCA President Datuk Seri Wei Jiaxiang said, "It will be discussed by the Supreme Council of the National Front! "
Tanjong Piai’ s parliamentary by-election is coming soon, and a great deal of attention is being paid to whether the MCA, a party in the National Front.
However, after the MCA Central Committee convened a meeting, it announced that it would be left to the Supreme Council of the National Front to decide whether this traditional MCA seat should continue belonging to MCA, or should go to another member party.
After chairing the MCA Central Committee meeting on Thursday afternoon, Wei Jiaxiang told the media that any by-elections would be conducted in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) by the National Front, which is to say, the meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front must pass it before it can be finalized.
He said that because the Election Committee would meet next Monday (1st) to finalize the parliamentary by-election of Tanjong Piai, the Supreme Council of the National Front meeting was expected to be held in early October.
"Yesterday (26th) in the morning, I also met with Datuk Seri Amozacy, chairman of the National Front, and we all agreed that we must retake this seat from the Pakatan Harapan. "
"We have decided to convene a special leadership meeting of the National Front in early October, and the heads of the three parties of the National Front will determine which party will enter the battle. "
Asked whether MCA would stick to entering the race for the traditional seats in front of the Supreme Council of the National Front, Wei Jiaxiang reiterated that as the chairman of MCA, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures, so any decision must be agreed upon by the National Front.
"In any by-election, some people are willing to go out campaigning, and some parties think that they should come out and do this, but this is commonplace. "
"The most important thing is, what organization and political alliance are we from? "

A Villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province Ordered to “Patrol the Mountain Free of Charge” after Capturing Wild Animals
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province was sentenced for hunting wild animals and simultaneously ordered to pay RMB 15,420 (Renminbi, the same below) in ecological environment and resources damages.
In consideration of the fact that the defendant’s family was poor, the procuratorate used substitute labor to replace the ecological repair expense, thereby realizing an organic unity between legal and social effect.
After accepting labor substitution, including “free mountain patrol” for 3 months, the defendant Zhou X developed profound feelings for wild macaques and felt deeply guilty for previously hunting wild animals, said Wang Zhongliang, Deputy Chief Procurator of the People’s Procuratorate of Baokang County on the 27th day of the month.
On June 21st this year, the People’s Court of Baokang County heard a philanthropic civil lawsuit collateral to criminal proceeding initiated by the People’s Procuratorate of Baokang County, and announced the judgment at the court.
The defendant Zhou X was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years with a probation of 4 years and a fine of RMB 3,000, and was ordered to pay RMB 15,420 in ecological environment and resources damages.
The investigation found that from late January 2014, Zhou X had set an electrified net at the cliff and hunted more than 20 wild animals, including goral, muntjak, and tufted deer.
Goral is a Chinese grade-two endangered protected wild animal, while muntjak and tufted deer are listed in the National Terrestrial Wildlife Protection Directory.
During the trial, Zhou X admitted the facts of his offense and behavior, and was willing to bear the collateral civil liability.
However, considering the poor economic conditions of Zhou X’s family, the local village committee, the forest station, and Zhou X reached an agreement on compensation for ecological damages with by labor substitution through mediation by the People’s Procuratorate of Baokang County: Zhou X would engage in macaque taming and care, mountain patrol free of charge, and forest protection for one year at the village macaque reserve, and would provide philanthropic labor services to compensate for biological repair expenses.
The court acknowledged the suggestion of the procurator and agreed that while under probation, Zhou X should actively perform his obligations to “compensate the biological repair expenses with labor substitution”.
So far, Zhou X has engaged in volunteer labor for 3 months, actively patrolled the mountain, and behaved well for 3 months.
In recent years, the People’s Procuratorate of Baokang County has organically fused the procuratorate function and social governance behavior, scientifically employed procuratorate suggestions, surveillance supervision, litigation supervision, and other supervision methods, and also applied judicial means to minimize the impact of offensive behaviors on the biological environment.
The United Nations Issues the “Champions of the Earth Award” to Ant Forest
Against the backdrop of warm applause and magnificent music, Xu Di, the project leader of the "Ant Forest", and Shen Junliang, user representative, walked to the podium to receive the 2019 UN “Champions of the Earth Award” from the host.
The 2019 UN “Champions of the Earth” award ceremony was held in New York, USA, on September 26th, and the Ant Forest project, which allows hundreds of millions of people to take part in environmental action through a mobile applet, won the award under the “Inspiration and Action” category.
The winners were announced a week ago by the United Nations Environment Programs at its headquarters in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, but the ceremony was still very exciting.
Ms. Inger Andersen, the Executive Director of United Nations Environment Programs, said during an interview with Xinhua News Agency that "Ant Forest" is an exciting innovation that will enable hundreds of millions of people to take action to understand the environmental challenges faced by the human beings and what can we do for the environment.
It uses technology to connect people and the environment, so that every individual can participate in protecting the earth, and it will have a huge impact.
"Ant Forest" was launched by China Ant Financial Services Group (Ant Financial for short) on Alipay in August 2016, where it allows users to accumulate "green energy" by logging their daily green trips, paying utilities online, and other low-carbon activities, and also to "plant trees" on their mobile phones.
For every virtual tree a user acquires, Ant Forest and its non-profit partners will plant a real tree on desertified land.
By August this year, 500 million users of "Ant Forest" had reduced their carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in desertified areas.
Costa Rica also received the “Champions of the Earth Award” due to their national environment protection efforts, and Carlos Alvarado, Costa Rica’s President, who was there to accept the award, praised "Ant Forest" for its contribution and "impressive ability to inspire so many people to take part in green initiatives."
Jing Xiandong, Chairman and CEO of Ant Financial, said that the “Champions of the Earth Award” is positive recognition for the "Ant Forest" project.
Its technology and open platform that make it possible for everyone to participate in low-carbon life, and the honor for the award belongs to every participant.
Jing said "Ant Forest" had affected 500 million people in the past 3 years, and its goal in the next 3 years is to inspire 1 billion people worldwide to take part in low-carbon activities.
Besides fighting desertification and environmental protection, they are also exploring ways to help farmers create more income from green mountains and rivers.
Apart from providing jobs planting trees, the company hopes to help farmers increase their income through agricultural development projects and e-commerce platforms.
The environmental protection public welfare model based on digital technology created by "Ant Forest" has also been successfully exported to other countries.
In June this year, GCash, the largest digital wallet in the Philippines, launched a Philippine version of "Ant Forest" to encourage users to better protect the environment by living a low-carbon life.
It is said that GCash plans to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within a year of the launch of the project in partnership with the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources and Environment Protection Public Welfare Organizations.
The “Champions of the Earth Award” is the UN's highest honor in the area of environmental protection.
"Ant Forest" follows the Builders of Saihanba Forest Farm in China and the Green Rural Revival Program of Zhejiang in China as the third green innovation protection project from China to receive the “Inspiration and Action” award for three consecutive years.
Economic and Trade Friction Affects U.S. Economic "Report Card".
Due to the sharp decline in private sector investment and exports, the growth rate of U.S. GDP in the second quarter of the year has slowed significantly compared to the previous quarter, the United States economic “report card” showed.
Analysts point out that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they brought about are the main reasons for the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on the 26th showed that U.S. GDP grew at an annual rate of 2% in the second quarter, which was the same as the previously revised data, but significantly lower than the 3.1% in the first quarter.
Data showed that consumption growth was the main factor supporting U.S. economic growth in the second quarter.
Personal consumption expenditures, which accounted for about 70% of the U.S. economy, increased by 4.6% quarter-on-quarter, driving 3.03 percentage points of economic growth.
In addition, government consumption expenditure and investment drove economic growth by 0.82 percent.
However, private sector investment in the second quarter fell by 6.3% from the previous quarter, dragging down economic growth by 1.16 percent; exports fell by 5.7% from the previous quarter, and net exports dragged down economic growth by 0.68 percent.
Barry Knapp, managing partner of the Ironside Macroeconomics Consulting Company in the United States, said that instead of maintaining last year's growth, private sector investment had fallen sharply as business confidence was hit by trade frictions and rising uncertainty.
Mr. Knapp believes that U.S. corporate capital spending is expected to remain on a downward trend next year amid policy uncertainty.
While consumption growth provided strong support to the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are growing signs that trade frictions and the uncertainty they brought have affected consumer confidence and hurt the outlook for U.S. consumption, analysts said.
In a recent survey, 38 percent of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, which was the highest percentage in a year and a half, said Richard Curtin, an economics professor at the university of Michigan who led the survey.
Regarding the future trend of the U.S. economy, analysts generally believe that the U.S. economy will continue to slow down.
However, some experts said that if economic and trade frictions are eased, the performance of the U.S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve.
Karin Birch, global economist of the British Economist Think Tank, predicts that the U.S. economy will continue its gradual downward trend this year, and the growth rate will drop to a lower level than that in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, Moody's Chief Economist, predicts that the U.S. economy will grow 2.3 percent this year and 1.6 percent next year, assuming economic frictions don't escalate.
Ellen Hatzen, an investment manager at Putnam Investments, said the biggest concern for businesses is the trade dispute and the uncertainty it brought about, but if economic and trade disputes can be resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced, and the performance of the industrial sector will be much better.
Matt Merley, stock strategist at Miller-Tabuck Asset Management, said that economic and trade frictions are still the "primary problem" and the main reason for the large fluctuations in the U.S. capital market this year, and whether trade frictions can be properly resolved will be the key to the direction of U.S. capital markets for the rest of the year.

This April, the General Office of the State Council issued the Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Development of Care Services for Infants Aged Below 3, which describes common childcare by both parents.
When amending the Regulation, Ningxia introduced an innovative concept: “encouraging employers to provide an annual 10-day common parental leave for the couple respectively during the period when the infant is aged 0-3, provided that the couple has an infant in line with laws and regulations”.
At the same time, the Regulation highlights the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulation adopts the latest legislative results in the personality rights section of China’s civil code, and stipulates in detail what constitutes sexual harassment, as well as anti-sexual harassment bodies and mechanisms.
Article 44 of the Regulation expressly forbids sexual assault events against female minors that frequently occur, and requires educational institutions to conduct the related education, protection, and prevention work, making Regulation has become a new benchmark among local legislation for protecting female minors.
As to females’ right to know and to dispose of common properties in the marriage and family, Article 35 expressly stipulates their right to know and to dispose of common properties, and also stipulates the obligations of property registration agencies and related entities, providing a solid institution support for females to protect their rights.
Besides, when addressing sexual discrimination in employment, which is a hotly debated issue in society, Article 26 not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also forbids indirect discrimination, and moreover adopts the latest joint interview practices and strengthens the penalty against the offensive sexually discriminating behavior to safeguard appropriate rights and interests of women.
In recent years, the Women’s Federation of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has worked together with the police, procuratorates, courts, justices, civil affairs, and other authorities to introduce and promote social professional forces to mediate marital and family disputes, and has made very significant achievements in this regard.
The Regulation summarizes and upgrades this aspect of law, and several articles of the Regulation encourage the mobilization of social forces and the gathering of social resources to jointly safeguard women’s rights and interests, and requires people’s governments at the county level and above to provide stable institutional support and security through service procurement.
Inner Mongolia Xing’an Yuan Longping Workstation: A Saline-Alkali Tolerant Rice Harvest of over Five Hundred Kilograms
This reporter learned from the Administrative Office of Xing’an Prefecture, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, that there was good news from the Saline-Alkali Tolerant Rice Harvest Evaluation Meeting of the Xing’an Yuan Longping Workstation, which was that the yield per mu broke through five hundred kilograms.
The expert team, consisting of 6 members from the Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou University, and the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs harvested the “Xing Saline Series” rice in the field.
Through the expert evaluation, on land with a pH value of 8.8 to 9.6 and a salinity of 5% to 6%, the average yield of the saline-alkali tolerant rice is 508.8kg.
Wang Shigang, Executive Director of Xing’an Yuan Longping Workstation, said, “For our next step, we plan to innovate and reform on the basis of this year’s testing, and redevelop and optimize the saline-alkali tolerant rice species to produce better quality and higher yield. "
Lai Yongcai, Leader of the Expert Team and Deputy President and Researcher of Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said, “When the production factors remain unchanged, I believe that the miracle of the saline-alkali tolerant rice will continue on saline-saturated land if we persist in strengthening our scientific and technological research. "
Xing’an Prefecture is within the concentrated poverty-stricken areas in the south of the Greater Khingan Range.
In October 2018, the Yuan Longping Workstation was established in Xing’an Prefecture.
Academician Yuan Long led his expert team to accelerate the introduction and promotion of the latest “saline-alkali tolerant hybrid rice” species and advanced technology, construct a 906-mu rice base in Horqin Right Middle Banner, and helped the local poverty-stricken population to increase its income and harvest through the technical route of testing while simultaneously promoting the technology.
This test harvest of saline-alkali tolerant rice brings hope for upgrading saline-saturated fields with low and medium yields to high yields, and also provides the scientific basis for the planting of rice on saline-saturated land with similar conditions in China.
According to au123.com, after a marathon debate and weeks of protests, New South Wales in Australia passed a bill to decriminalize abortion on September 26th (local time).
It is reported that the bill has triggered political debate over the past eight weeks, and since independent MP Greenwich announced the introduction of the bill, deep divisions in the Liberal Party have been revealed.
The NSW House of Senate approved the bill decriminalizing abortion by 26 votes to 14 on the night of September 25th following nearly 40 hours of discussion, making it the third longest debate in the state’s House of Senate’s history.

Liberal MP Tanya Davies, the strongest opponent of the bill, threatened to quit the NSW government and declared that the bill caused a "crisis of Government".

"The amendment presented to the House of Representatives to the abortion bill on the morning of September 26th actually provides more protection for women and doctors," Tanya Davies said. "
Meanwhile, NSW Nationals leader John Barilaro said he was proud to be part of a government that had decriminalized abortion.
"What we achieved last night, decriminalizing abortion, declassifying it as a criminal act and making it a health act as it should be, and not treating women like criminals, is historic for the state," he said. "

Liu Kun, Minister of Finance: 67 state-owned enterprises and financial institutions have transferred state funds of 860.1 billion yuan to enrich the social security fund.
67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, and a total of about 860.1 billion yuan of state-owned capital has been transferred, finance minister Liu Kun said on the 27th.
Liu Kun made the above statement at the deployment meeting of the national transfer of state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, which was jointly held by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the SASAC.
“Transferring some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund is an important measure to reform and improve the basic endowment insurance system; it is a full reflection of the development achievements of state-owned enterprises and the intergenerational equity of the basic endowment insurance system, so it is both a current and long-term policy. "
In 2017, the State Council issued the Implementation Plan for Transferring Part of State-owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Funds, requiring that some central enterprises and some provinces be selected for pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the preliminary work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, a total of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have transferred in three batches, with a total amount of 860.1 billion yuan transferred from the state.
Among them, the transfer work of the central financial institution that the Ministry of Finance has performed as an investor has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises has reached a certain scale.
At the local level, the preliminary work of the transfer of enterprises has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, pilot projects in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had been basically completed, with 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan of state capital transferred respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have successively carried out preparatory work for the transfer, laying a foundation for the next implementation of the project.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the transfer of some state capital from the central and local governments to the social security fund will be fully implemented in 2019 and basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on the same day made specific arrangements for the overall implementation of the work.
The meeting emphasized the need to complete the transfer work pragmatically and efficiently.
“According to the schedule, the transfer work should be basically completed by the end of 2020.
The transfer work is tough job in limited time. "
All regions and departments should carefully organize and make arrangements to ensure that the transfer work is completed as required, solidly advance the work and accurately grasp the content of the transfer policy; strengthen communication and coordination to solve difficult problems in a timely manner, Liu Kun said.
Transferring state-owned assets to enrich social security funds -- starting from “enriching the money bag of social security funds” to provide powerful support for pension security.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple "physical shift" of equity, serves as a "mathematical addition".
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission jointly issued the Notice on Comprehensively Implementing the Work of Transferring a Portion of State-owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Funds to clarify the schedule of transferring state-owned assets to social security funds, that is, the central and local governments transfer of a portion of state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund would be fully implemented in 2019.
After the issue of the document, the Ministry of Finance and other departments also put it into practice quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred its 10% of the stock rights of ICBC and ABC to entirely to the social security fund; the total value of the transfer of the two stock rights exceeded RMB 115 billion.
According to the regulations, the financial investors, social security foundations, and other undertaking entities are endowed with the rights of income, disposal, and the rights to know of the state-owned stock rights.
In the announcement, ICBC and ABC showed that the change in equity would not lead to the change of controlling shareholders and actual controllers of the Banks.
To this point, the author believes that similar equity transfers of state-owned enterprises is not a simple change of ownership, but is an "addition operation" that can stimulate a series of effects.
The first step “addition result” of transferring a portion of state-owned assets to social security can naturally reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises by the whole people, and the development results can be shared by the whole people.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in China's economy, and their overall profitability is strong and stable.
Among them, leading enterprises even continue to achieve better, bigger, and stronger results.
On July 10, at the executive meeting of the State Council, it was decided to promote the transfer of part of state-owned capital in the round to enrich the social security fund this year.
Then, the Ministry of Finance stated that it would work with relevant departments to promote the transfer of a portion of state-owned capital in the round to enrich social security funds, according to the deployment of the executive meeting of the State Council, to fully reflect the intergenerational equity of the basic endowment insurance system and the nationwide sharing of development achievements of state-owned enterprises.
The second “addition result” of the transfer is to heighten the sustainability of social security fund in China to further consolidate the foundation of the old-age social security system.
With the aging of population, the social security fund in China is under pressure, while as the transferring entities, most of the state-owned assets have the ability to sustainably earn profits and pay dividends, which can not only effectively supplement the social security fund, but also provide a source for the social security fund.
According to the calculation, when every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital are transferred, the deposit ratio of the basic pension insurance of the enterprise can be reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third “addition result” of the transfer is to add a stabilizer for the capital market.
The way to benefit undertaking entities from this transfer is “dividends first, operation as auxiliaries second”.
As a financial investor of state-owned capital, the social security fund genuinely holds obtaining equity dividends as its first priority.
However, as a value investor in the capital market, social security funds are endowed with a powerful capital operation capabilities.
For listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in shareholding will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, which will be beneficial to improving the level of business operation and have a positive impact on listed companies and the capital market.
Meanwhile, social security funds, as the investment benchmark, have increased their shareholding ratio, which is beneficial to further strengthening its influence in the market and acting as a “stabilizer” in the market.
Furthermore, it is also be beneficial to giving full play to the “value discovery” function of institutional investors and guiding investors to invest rationally and carry out value investing.

Iran upgrades nuclear infrastructure, a further step to scale down its commitments to the nuclear deal
China News, Sept. 27 According to a report by Central News Agency, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on the 26th that Iran's use of advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium has once again violated the 2015 nuclear deal.
It is reported that Iran is stepping away from the restrictions of the deal in response to Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018 while he resumes and tightens sanctions against Iran.
Iran has suspended two other commitments to keep a maximum 300 kilograms of uranium enriched to 3.67% in July, and is now making further moves.
Under the atomic accord, Iran is limited to operating around 5,000 older IR-1 centrifuges at Natanz (Natanz) to accumulate uranium, and is only allowed to use a small number of more advanced models for research, not to produce enriched uranium.
Succeeding in developing more advanced centrifuges will enable Iran to enrich uranium rapidly, which will quickly bring the material to weapons-grade levels.
The IAEA reported that, “The agency has confirmed that Iran has developed advanced model 2 and model 3 centrifuges on September 25... They are accumulating or have accumulated enriched uranium. ”
Once the IAEA submitted the report to member states on the 26th, a diplomat responded, "They are very busy (at the Natanz Uranium Enrichment Site). ”

Baidu starts trial operations of its first self-driving taxi team
Baidu declared its official start of trial operations of its self-driving taxi in Changsha yesterday.
The first Robotaxi fleet of 45 "Hongqi EV" taxis, which are jointly developed by Apollo and FAW Hongqi, has begun trial operations on open test roads in Changsha.
From today, Changsha citizens can log on to the Apollo official website and apply to participate, and may win the chance to have a trial ride.
One passenger tried the robot-driven vehicles, and said he could start the vehicle with one tap on the screen placed in front of the passenger seat while seated in the back.
For the safety of passengers, and to meet the requirements of current policies and regulations, trial vehicles are equipped with a safety guard in the driver's seat to maximize passenger’s security.
While driving, the vehicles can intelligently change lanes according to the traffic, can judge the driving state of surrounding vehicles, and can automatically avoid situations such as close overtaking.
Throughout the trip, the passenger screen shows pedestrians, cars, and even some traditional blind areas on the road in real time.
Even if some vehicles are blocking the view, the passenger can still see the change of traffic lights and waiting time in advance, making all traffic conditions clear at a glance.
Driverless cars are things we’ve heard of on TV before, and we thought they would take time to truly be adopted in real life, which is why it's amazing to find them in our lives today.
We really hope they can be available to ordinary people in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo received 45 manned testing licenses issued by the Changsha municipal government.
At present, roads open for self-driving test in Changsha can be found in places such as the Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology Town, Meixi Lake, Yanghu Lake, Dawang Mountain and the High-tech Zone, with a total length of 135 kilometers and a demonstration area of 70 square kilometers, making this currently the intelligent driving demonstration zone with the longest mileage, the largest area, the most complex scenarios, and the most advanced vehicle-road coordination infrastructure in China.
It is estimated that by the end of 2019, the length of trial operation roads of the Apollo Robotaxi fleet in Changsha will be 50 km, and may reach 135km in the first half of 2020.
Lang Ping still feels dissatisfied even after the Women’s Volleyball Team victory: with so many mistakes, it will be very difficult to defeat a powerful rival

“After the opposing team became more aggressive when serving balls in the third round, some of our team members (first passer) couldn’t resist the powerful attack, so we also made many mistakes. ”
“With so many mistakes, it will be very difficult to defeat a powerful rival. ”
said Lang Ping in an interview after the round.
“We told our members to be devoted, if the first passer is attacked and can’t get in place, we need to adjust and attack our opponent, and we should also fight our opponent by defending our own goal. ”
Lang Ping also commented on the performance of Zhang Changning, noting that when attacks caused her difficulty, Zhang seemed a little nervous, and wanted so much to make a dunk shot that her motions became distorted.
Lang Ping hoped she would be more patient, saying “We will all protect her”.
China’s Development Is An Opportunity, Not A Threat Or Challenge, To The World.
(70 Years of New China) White Paper: China’s Development Is An Opportunity, Not A Threat Or Challenge, To The World.
This white paper states that China’s development is an opportunity, not a threat or challenge, to the world.
As China’s overall national strength and international influence rapidly increases, some people in the world worry that China is bound to seek hegemony as a strong nation, and some people even promote the so-called “China Threat Theory”.
It arises from various factors - cognitive misunderstanding, ingrained prejudice, psychological imbalance caused by growing and declining power, and deliberate misrepresentation for the purpose of safeguarding vested interests.
There cannot be much dispute that all people, Chinese or otherwise, yearn for their country’s prosperity, national rejuvenation, and social happiness.
“China’s development is an opportunity, not a threat or challenge, to the world. ”
The white paper says that China has always worked to stabilize, promote, reinvigorate, and been the greatest contributor to global economic growth through its technological innovation, role which will be ever more prominent in the future.
At present, the robust Chinese economy is becoming increasingly important to global economic growth, which remains sluggish.
From high-speed growth to high-quality development, the Chinese economy is in the midst of transformation marked by accelerating new-type industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, as well as in the midst of profoundly adjusting economic structure, upgrading industry optimization, and constantly emerging new economic growth points.
“According to the research reports by McKinsey Global Institute, by 2040, China, cooperating with other economies, is expected to create a massive economic value of USD 22 trillion to 37 trillion, equivalent to 15%-26% of the global economic aggregate. ”
The white paper emphasizes that both Chinese economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and become deeply integrated.
With more stable economic operations, higher growth quality, and promising growth prospects, China is beneficial to the global economic development in the long run.
It is neither feasible nor detrimental to regard China’s economic development as a “threat” or “challenge” and disconnect China from the world economy by pushing China out of the global industry chain, supply chain, and value chain.
The white paper says that openness to the outside world on all fronts will bring more opportunities to share the “China dividend” with various countries.
To open up more forcefully at a higher level, China unwaveringly implements a win-win strategy of opening up, and with the largest potential consumer market in the world, China has become the most attractive investment destination, and will go further in its efforts to globalize to benefit even more countries.
“Opening up should be bidirectional and win-win, not unidirectional and win-lose.
Only in this way, both parties in the partnership can work together in the longer run. ”
The white paper says that China has shown its commitment to continuously expanding imports, relaxing control over market access, improving business environment, and strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights, and that other countries should also expand openness and take corresponding measures to improve their business environment.
All parties should work together in the same direction to create an open, inclusive, generous, balanced, and win-win development environment, speed up common development, and create a win-win community of common interests.
The white paper also says that China will provide more public goods to the international community.
In the future, China will strive to promote the high-quality construction of the Belt and Road, build up multilateral dialogues and cooperation platforms, actively participate in the international and regional affairs, and provide more foreign aid.
“China has benefited from the international community in development, and in turn, will always contribute to international community by providing more and better public goods. ”
In the written interview with a reporter from Xinhua News Agency recently, Andre Srepniov, the general manager of the Russian Export Center, said that Russia was willing to strengthen the cooperation with China in the field of economy and trade so as to further optimize the export structure and promote the diversification of Russia's exports to China.
Srepniov showed clearly that forestry, machine manufacturing, and the chemical industry account for a large proportion of Russia's exports to China, and at the same time, the export of agricultural products is also very important, including oil products, meat products, and dairy products, as well as cereals, fish and seafood.
Russia's exports of non-raw materials and non-energy products to China have also shown healthy and stable development for the past few years.
When it comes to optimizing Russia's export structure to China, Srepniov said that Russia has set the task of expanding its export of high-tech products to meet the import demand for high-tech products from countries and regions in the world including China.
Next, Russia will perfect financial and non-financial support measures to promote further growth in the number of high-tech enterprises.
In Srepniov’s opinion, Russia is willing to export construction technology and high-tech construction materials to China, and develop cooperation with China in medicine, aerospace manufacture, and other fields.
There is also great potential for cooperation in the field of urban environmental development for Russia and China.
He stressed that, compared with similar products in the West, Russia's products in many fields “have advantages in quality and are competitive in price”.
When it comes to the two countries' goal of achieving a bilateral trade volume of 200 billion U.S. dollars by 2024, Srepniov said that agriculture, machine manufacturing, the chemical industry, forestry, and other fields will play an important role in achieving this goal.
Russia is inclined to advance the supply diversification in these fields and promote the export of highly processed products.
He stressed that Russia is inclined to promote its exporters to enter the global value-added chain, among which China is one of the development directions.
Russian manufacturers in agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas, the chemical industry, and other fields are fully capable of participating in this process.
At present, the two countries need to continue deepening the cooperation between enterprises, “to establish more Russian-Chinese joint ventures, and jointly develop exports to third countries”.
Srepniov expressed that the Russian Export Center is taking various measures and services through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Export-Import Bank to provide support for the export of Russian products to China.
At the same time, the Russian Export Center will continue to deepen cooperation with relevant Chinese departments to promote Russian goods to enter the Chinese market more conveniently and develop new types of products to export to China.

Demonstration blasts President in Egypt, demanding he step down, authorities intend to suppress it with force
Twitter hashtags and social media are vigorously advocating that Egyptians should taking to the streets today to peacefully ask President Sisi to step down.
But the authorities have stated their intention to use force to suppress these demonstrations.
Since then military chief Sisi launched a military coup in 2013 to seize power, such dissent has almost disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest puts participants in extreme danger.
The Guardian reported that Cairo's NGO Egypt Economic and Social Rights Centre has noted that more than 1900 people were arrested since the rare outbreak of protests over the weekend that required Sisi to step down.
Allegations of corruption about Sisi and his family’s pursuit of vanity and waste of money led thousands of people to take to the streets for demonstrations on the 20th.
The Ministry of the Interior of Egypt stated firmly yesterday that it would resolutely respond to any attempt to destabilize the country and would not show mercy.
Downtown Cairo is already heavily guarded, with riot police, security agency vehicles, and plainclothes police everywhere on the streets surrounding Tahrir Square, the tipping point of the Egyptian revolution in 2011.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of important scholars and social elites on the 25th, including Nafah, a professor of political science at Cairo University and a well-known columnist.
He tweeted on the 24th, "I have no doubt that continuing the absolute rule of Sisi will cause disaster. "
"It is in Egypt's interest that he step down immediately. "
Prior to Nafah' s arrest, Hosni, a former spokesman for Egypt's former Military Chief of Staff, Annan, was detained.
Annan was arrested last year after trying to compete with Sisi for the presidency.
Constitutional Party Chairman Davoud was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that at a time when the economic hardships of the poor and the middle class are intensifying, locking up dissidents reflects the government’s instability and vulnerability.
Opposition leader Ayman Nour, who once competed for the presidency, said, "The arrests underscore the regime's disregard for the Egyptian people and how afraid it is. "
"Because he has ruined the economy and faces widespread political oppression, Sisi is trying to send a clear message to the important generals and politicians who may replace him. "
Noir pointed out that given the continued deterioration of the socio-economic situation, the government's high-pressure approach would only increase people's anger.
Now that the barrier of fear has been breached, he expected more people to take to the streets.
The businessman and actor Ali, who is currently in exile in Spain, and was formerly an Egyptian military construction contractor, began uploading a series of videos early this month, and claimed to benefit from government corruption, triggering a small wave of demonstrations in different cities last weekend.
Ali said that his company Amlak received lucrative contracts without going through the legal bidding process, emphasizing the serious corruption of the military and relatives of Sisi, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He deeply regretted his involvement.
Ali claims that he helped Sisi build magnificent palaces and luxury hotels that were in sharp contrast to the current poverty of Egyptians and was not paid.
On Twitter, hashtags such as "Come forward and you are not alone", "Sisi is finished", "Sisi get out", and "Next Friday" have attracted thousands of tweets and retweets, whose content calls for the people to take to the streets in a peaceful manner and ask Sisi to step down.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amr Waked has nearly 7 million followers on Twitter.
He tweeted in Arabic yesterday: "Sisi is doomed ... He's over, and his supporters are making a big mistake now. "

The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region announced on September 27th that a special free training program will be launched for employees affected by recent economic conditions, and a monthly training allowance up to HK $4,000 will be paid to eligible trainees upon completion of the course.
Many boutiques in Harbor City, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, have few customers.

Law described the challenges faced by Hong Kong's economy as too urgent to wait for the situation to recede.
Therefore, the Government has launched the free training program called the “Special Scheme for Upgrades in the name of Love”.
It is said all those who lost their jobs or were asked to take unpaid leave by their employers since June 1st will have the opportunity to participate in the program as long as they meet the requirements.
Law said that the courses covered a wide range of areas, the most important of which is "vocational skills" training in 19 industries including tourism, retail, and catering, and that there will also be some new courses on "innovative technologies" and cross-industry "general skills".
Yu Peng-chun, the chairman of the Employees Retraining Board, said that all courses are free of charge and the program is expected to support about 10,000 people in need.
Participants who have completed the full-time or part-time course with an attendance rate of 80% will receive a special allowance of HK $4,000 per participant per month.
The training course will last 2 to 3 months and will be offered by about 50 training institutions, will be available since October 3rd to March 31st next year, and each person can sign up for up to 4 courses.
The Government also announced a series of measures to support the tourism industry to tide over the difficulties.

Does exercise tire both the body and the brain?
A study of athletes indicates that the brain also shows signs of fatigue after intense exercise, according to Sputnik.
The study, led by Mathias Pesiglione from the Pitie Salpetriere Hospital in France, showed a weak link between mental and physical work: both require cognitive control of activities.
Mathias Pesiglione explains, “You need to control the process that can force you to stop when your muscles and joints are sore. "
The study was initiated by the French National Institute of Sport, Expertise, and Performance (INSEP).
INSEP’s experts are responsible for guiding athletes in preparation for the Olympics.
Some athletes suffer from overtraining syndrome, a condition in which they feel uncontrollably tired after high-intensity exercise, and their bodies can’t recover, resulting in performance decline.
INSEP put forward this question: Is it partially because of neurological fatigue due to excessive mental work?
The study was published in Current Biology.

Helping Chinese Citizens Be More at Ease as they “Go Out” - An Interview with Cui Aimin, Director of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Wherever you go, the motherland is behind you.
On the 25th, the first Ministry of Foreign Affairs Consul Protection Public interest short film was launched, and the line at the end of the short film resonated with the broad masses of netizens.
Cui Aimin, Director of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency that the short film aims to further make the public feel the sentiment and atmosphere of “diplomacy for the people”, and to make Chinese citizens feel that no matter where they are the world, Chinese diplomats will lend them a helping hand, and provide them with aid, strength, and hope.
There are no trivial matters as far as personal safety overseas is concerned, and we care about every one of our people.
Cui Aimin said that over the past 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens “going out” has increased sharply from “less than one million a year” before reform and opening up to more than 100 million people a year today, and at the same time, the safety of Chinese citizens traveling abroad has become more secure, while the objects of consular protection work and assistance have also expanded from overseas Chinese to include foreign people of Chinese ethnicity, tourists, foreign students, migrant workers, and other groups.
According to statistics, since the 18th CPC National Congress, we have organized and carried out more than 10 major actions to evacuate or transfer overseas Chinese citizens, safely evacuating more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
About 500,000 cases of assistance were accepted and coordinated, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
In times of danger, the motherland can take you home; and go wherever you want to go, it is no longer a dream.
By the end of August this year, China had concluded visa exemption agreements with 14 countries covering ordinary passport holders, according to Cui Aimin.
In addition, more and more countries have unilaterally granted visa-free or visa-on-arrival facilities to Chinese citizens.
Thailand, Egypt and other 42 countries and regions have unilaterally granted visa-on-arrival to Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports, while 15 countries and regions, including Indonesia, unilaterally allowed Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports to enter their countries without visas.
In addition to visa-free and visa-on-arrival arrangements, it is becoming more convenient for Chinese citizens to apply for visas, and the procedures are becoming simpler.
By the end of August, China had reached agreements or arrangements with 41 countries to simplify visa procedures.
These include the agreement with the United States, Canada, Israel, and Argentina to issue multiple visas to each other for tourism and business personnel for 10 years, and with the United Kingdom to issue multiple visas to each other for travel, business, and family visits for two years, and so on.
The United Kingdom and Belgium jointly launched a “visa one-stop” service, with France, Italy and Singapore, reducing the visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours, and 24 hours, respectively.
For business people who often go abroad, the APEC business travel card with multiple entries and convenient customs clearance is a good choice.
According to Cui Aimin, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining multiple visas for 16 economies around the Asia-Pacific region for five years, which is of great significance for business people, especially those from private enterprises, as they “go out.”
At present, China ranks first among APEC economies in terms of effective card holders.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocal agreements, promote more countries to adopt visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens, turn the results of diplomatic work into measures to benefit and facilitate the people, and constantly increase the ‘value' of Chinese passports.

Jiangxi: The "Line Guard” guards the security of operations of passenger transportation lines.
According to the Jiangxi Provincial Highway Transportation Management Bureau, to date, 1,334 passenger transportation lines in 11 districts and cities in Jiangxi and 6 counties directly under the jurisdiction of the province all have "line guards."
The person in charge of the Jiangxi Provincial Highway Transportation Management Bureau explained that due to the formal safety management of some passenger transport companies, the responsibility of safety targets has not been fulfilled, that illegal actions such as speeding in passenger vehicles and driving while fatigued have occurred frequently, and the dangers in passenger transportation are severe.
In order to further consolidate the main responsibility of road passenger transport enterprises for safe production and ensure the safety of passengers, Jiangxi started the pilot project of the "line guard system" in 2017 and began to gradually promote it throughout the whole province in 2018.
At present, 92 road passenger transport companies in Jiangxi have implemented the "line guard system" and assigned 1,334 "line guards" for passenger transportation management, which cover 4,824 passenger buses.
According to reports, the "line guard" is generally designated by passenger transport companies to take charge of the specific management of the people, cars, lines and other work, to ensure that the person in charge has comprehensive control over the line, vehicle, driver, and operating environment, so as to ensure the operational safety of the line.

The United States will deploy more air defense systems and forces to Saudi Arabia
The United States Department of Defense announced on September 26th that it will deploy one Patriot air defense system, 4 groups of Sentinel radar systems, and around 200 more troops to Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of the attack on Saudi oil facilities.
The Pentagon said in a statement that this deployment will enhance air defense and anti-missile capabilities at key military targets and civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and bolster the U.S. military presence in the region.
The statement further says that U.S. Secretary of Defense Dr. Esper has also approved the preparation of two Patriot air defense systems and one THAAD anti-missile system in the deployment sequence.
Some US defense media have questioned the effectiveness of the deployment, saying that the main interception targets of the Patriot and THAAD systems are not low-altitude targets such as the drones and cruise missiles that attacked Saudi Arabia as claimed by the US.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in his speech in the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly on September 25th that Iran can help maintain "safety in the Persian gulf" and ensure the smooth and safe navigation of oil carriers through the Strait of Hormuz, provided all countries enjoy equal rights.
He also emphasized that safety of the region can only be achieved when U.S. forces withdraw from the region.
On September 14th, several drones attacked two Saudi Aramco oil facilities, resulting in a fire.
The United States blamed Iran for the attack and imposed new sanctions upon Iran.
Chairman of Thalys’s increase in shareholding plan completed last year, called on employees to increase their holdings by up to 43%.
On the evening of September 25, Thalys (603716.SH) announced that the company’ s actual controller and chairman, Wen Wei, had increased his holdings of 1054200 shares in total through the Shanghai Stock Exchange’ s collective bidding transaction, accounting for 0.5139% of the company's total share capital,; the total increase added up to RMB 20.0926 million (including stamp taxes, commissions, interest and other transaction costs), and completed his plan to increase his shareholder ownership.
It is reported that before the implementation of this shareholding increase plan, Wen Wei directly held 8.58 million shares of Thalys, accounting for 4.18% of the company's total share capital; the controlling shareholder Tianjin Ruimei Scientific Instrument Corporation Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Tianjin Ruimei") held 82.835 million shares of the company, accounting for 40.06% of the company's total share capital, and Wen Wei holds 66.06% shares of Tianjin Ruimei, who is the actual controller of the company.
It is worth mentioning that this is not the first time that Thalys has offered positive measures.
Since September last year, in a short period of only one year, Thalys has successively introduced measures such as executives' increase in holdings, a proposal of fallback increases in the holdings of the chairman, share repurchases, and equity incentives.
On September 18 last year, Thalys announced that the company's seven senior management personnel, including Liu Wenhao, planned to increase their holding to 390300 shares (accounting for 0.1922% of the company's total share capital), so the total increase added up to 7022900 yuan, and the current shareholding plan has been fully implemented.
Shortly thereafter, Wen Wei, the chairman and actual controller of Thalys, proposed a plan for the employees to increase the company's shareholder ownership, and promised to compensate them himself should any losses occur.
The holding increase period is from October 19 to October 31, 2018, and the maximum limit of the increase of the total holding of the company's shares is not to exceed 150 million yuan, but after the increase, the company's shares must be held continuously for more than 12 months, and the employees had to remain employed at the time of receiving compensation.
This reporter found that during the period of the above-mentioned initiatives to increase employee holdings, the stock price of Thalys was as low as 14.02 yuan and as high as 16.44 yuan, and based on the closing price of Thalys on September 25, the price was 20.02 yuan, while employee holdings increased by up to 42.80% and down to 21.78%.
On January 21 of this year, Thalys once again approved the company's share repurchase plan, announcing that the total amount of funds intended to be used to repurchase shares was not less than 160 million yuan, but not more than 280 million yuan.
On August 8 this year, the company issued the announcement of the "2019 Thalys Restricted Stock Incentive Plan (Draft)" and set very high unlocking performance conditions.
It was shown in the announcement that in 2018, operating income boosted equity incentives, and the growth rates, from 2019 to 2022 for the four fiscal years were not less than 30%, 70%, 120%, and 185% respectively.
Judging from Thalys' s performance in the first half of the year, the company maintained high growth and exceeded the unlocking condition of 30% growth this year.
In the first half of the year, it realized operating income of 842 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 46.50%; net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies was 56.2324 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 16.46%.
Since the 2018 Interim Report, Thalys has achieved a year-on-year growth rate of more than 38% for five consecutive reporting periods, with a maximum growth rate of 59%.
In 2018, the company established a dual-core-driven collaborative development strategy based on the medical inspection intensive operation service (IVD Business), regarding the medical consumables intensive operation service (SPD Business) and the regional inspection center as breakthroughs, and iteratively upgraded on the basis of the advantages of the previous IVD Business to promote the SPD Business.
Relevant personnel at Thalys told reporters that in order to comply with the general trend of medical reform and achieve rapid expansion, the three major businesses of Thalys were steadily advancing.
In the SPD Business field, in January of this year, Thalys announced that it had signed the "Cooperation Agreement for the Construction of Intensive Medical Consumable Operation Platforms and Daily Operation Management Services" with Lingwu People's Hospital and Lingwu Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital.
"In fact, Thalys is vigorously expanding its SPD business to provide medical institutions with sophisticated operating services such as centralized purchases of medical consumables, warehousing management, distribution, and settlement to obtain long-term revenue, "
said the person mentioned above.
On September 17, according to the Zhejiang Government Procurement Service Information Platform of the Zhejiang Government Procurement Network announcement, Thalys won the auction of a "medical consumables (including reagents) in-hospital logistics extension service project" from Shao Yifu Hospital of the medical college of Zhejiang University .
Pharmaceutical industry analysts pointed out that this bid was very profitable, because Shao Yifu Hospital is the first public hospital in mainland China to pass the Joint Commission International (JCI); the smooth implementation of this project in the future is also an important development opportunity for the hospital.
According to its analysis, previously, Thalys’s business areas basically covered all the provinces in the country through regional expansion, national strategic cooperation, and channel mergers and acquisitions.
Winning the bid of Shao Yifu Hospital means acquiring another city in Zhejiang, and they should continue to replicate this model in different hospitals to enhance the company's competitiveness in the East China market.
In addition, this year, Thalys is also deploying in emerging areas such as industrial marijuana and blockchain technology.

The British oil tanker Stena Impero, held by Iran for more than two months was, released and set off from Bandar Abbas Port, Iran, on the morning of September 27th for international waters.
In the middle of last month, the authorities in Gibraltar, a British overseas territory, released an Iranian oil tanker that had been held for more than a month.
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, at 9 am September 27th (local time), the British oil tanker Stena Impero left Bandar Abbas Port for the international waters of the Persian Gulf.
Iran’s Hormozgan Port and Maritime Organization confirmed that the tanker's commander and crew had made formal and written commitments that, despite the fact that it was impounded, they had no claims for compensation.
Stena Bulk, the Swedish owner of Stena Impero, also said the tanker was sailing from Bandar Abbas Port.
Moreover, Refinitiv's vessel tracking data also found that the tanker began moving on September 27th and left Bandar Abbas Port.
The British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero was impounded by Iran in July.
The Company’s spokesman said the tanker was preparing to leave Bandar Abbas Port.
Two weeks after Britain impounded an Iranian tanker in the sea area of Gibraltar, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps detained the tanker, Stena Impero, in the strait of Hormuz waterway.
The tanker was released in August.
Earlier this week, the Iranian government spokesman said all legal procedures needed to release the Stena Impero had been handled.
However, Iran says the investigation is ongoing.
Several Iranian media also posted videos of the tanker's departure.
On July 19th, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Navy detained a British oil tanker, the Stena Impero, in Iranian waters in the strait of Hormuz, and escorted it to Bandar Abbas Port.
The Iranian oil tanker Grace 1, which was being held, left the waters of Gibraltar.
On July 4th, the authorities in Gibraltar, a British overseas territory, seized the oil tanker Grace 1, which was carrying Iranian crude oil in the strait of Gibraltar, on suspicion of transporting oil to Syria in violation of EU sanctions.
One month later, on August 15th, the authorities in Gibraltar announced the release of the Grace 1.
This afternoon, a special conference on the review and rectification of thematic education of undergraduate universities and colleges in the province was held in Changsha.
Wu Lan, deputy secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, emphasized that it was necessary to improve political standing, strengthen political responsibilities, take a rigorous approach to problems to review and rectification, and promote the high-quality development of party building, ideology, and reform and development in universities and colleges through the effectiveness of thematic education.
Wu Lan fully affirmed the preliminary results achieved by the undergraduate colleges and universities in the second batch of thematic education.
She pointed out that carrying out the thematic education of “remaining true to our original aspirations and keeping our mission firmly in mind” was a major deployment made by the Party Central Committee; all undergraduate colleges and universities must thoroughly study and implement the spirit of the important speech made by general secretary Xi Jinping on carrying out the theme of “remaining true to our original aspiration and keeping our mission firmly in mind”.
We should carefully complete the prescribed actions of the thematic education, especially the series of issues identified through solid rectification, and coordinate the reform and development of the school from the political height of enhancing the "four consciousnesses", achieving the "two maintenances", and fulfilling the original mission, to achieve the goal of "neglecting neither and improving both".
Wu Lan stressed that we must adhere to the principle that one shall always keep an eye on himself, focus on self-reflection, use the "four comparisons" and "four searches" standards to discover problems and open up paths to seek suggestions from the teachers, students, employees, parents, and all sectors of society, and we should dig deep into the root ideologically and then clarify the direction of our efforts and measures to improve ourselves to come up with practical and effective means to solve difficulties.
It is necessary to adhere to precise force development and strengthen true reforms to truly and thoroughly implement the word "rectification".
It is necessary to do a good job in combining thematic education with "enhancing morality and fostering talents", fully implement responsibility for rectification, and ensure that all the problems are settled so as to achieve the actual results of rectification.
We must adhere to solving both the root cause and the problem itself, improve long-term mechanisms, weave the institutional cage tightly, strengthen the rigid constraints of the system, and ensure that all work is rule-based, and all the relevant people, affairs, and power are truly managed by the system.
We must insist on leaders setting examples: leading cadres should take the lead in arming themselves with theory, in carefully reviewing and rectifying, in strict self-discipline to give play to the role of "key minorities" as a model, and strive to complete the thematic education review and rectification tasks.
The responsible comrades of the Party Committees from five universities including Hunan University and the responsible comrades from relevant provincial offices also made speeches.
The "One AC, One DC", dual UHV projects are put into service
The Zhundong-Wannan ±1,100 kV UHV DC transmission project and the Sutong 1,000 kV UHV AC GIL tunnel project were put into service on the 26th.
These two projects currently boast the world's highest electricity transmission capacity in their respective transmission modes, and enable the China’s energy resource allocation to be optimized to a much greater degree.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the National Energy Administration, said that the Zhundong-Wannan project is the transmission project with the highest power transmission capacity and the longest transmission distance globally.
Its completion is of great significance in promoting the development of energy bases in Xinjiang and ensuring the power supply in East China.
GIL means gas-insulated transmission line.
And with the highest voltage level and the highest transmission capacity among GIL projects worldwide, the Sutong GIL Tunnel Project has closed the loop of the ‘AC double-loop network’ among the main power grids with the highest voltage level in East China.
The State Grid said that the transmission distance from the Zhundong to Wannan is 3,324 kilometers.
Using conventional technology, more than 15% of all electricity would be lost on the way, but through research and development, the economically feasible transmission distance was raised above 3,000 kilometers.
The Zhundong-Wannan project can transmit 100 million kWh every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help to absorb existing new energy sources in Xinjiang.
Assuming full load, the power transmitted annually on this line alone will reach 60 to 85 billion kilowatt hours, which could satisfy more than half of Shanghai's annual electricity consumption.
The Sutong GIL tunnel project is a UHV AC loop project crossing the Yangtze River.
If conventional overhead lines were used to cross the river, two giant iron support towers more than 450 meters in height would need to be built on the Yangtze River, and an artificial island larger than four soccer fields would need to be built for each tower.
State Grid boldly innovated and developed compact UHV AC GIL transmission technology to cross the river through underwater tunnels, thereby avoiding any impact it on this golden waterway.
Both projects are significant leaps forward in China's electrical equipment manufacturing capabilities.
The State Grid has completed "10 AC, 11 DC" UHV projects, and "4 AC, 3 DC" projects are still under construction.
SAFE: China's foreign debt structure continues to improve.
“Overall, China's external debt structure has been continuously optimized and its stability has been enhanced. "
Wang Chunying, spokesman and chief economist of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said on the 27th that the main indicators of China's foreign debt are within the internationally recognized safety line, and that the risk of foreign debt is generally controllable.
Wang Chunying made the remarks in response to a reporter's question when the SAFE released the data of the end of June 2019.
Data shows, by the end of June 2019, the balance of China's full-caliber foreign debt (including local and foreign currencies) was 198 billion US dollars, an increase of 26.3 billion US dollars or 1.3 percent over the end of March 2019, mainly due to the increase in the balance of debt securities.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70% of the increase in China's total foreign debt was driven by the purchase of domestic RMB bonds by non-residents, and the non-residents were mainly medium and long-term investors such as the Central Bank.
At the end of June 2019, the proportion of medium and long-term foreign debt increased by 3 percent compared with the end of March 2019, and the proportion of local currency foreign debt increased by 1 percent compared with the end of March 2019.
Wang said that with the inclusion of China's domestic RMB bonds in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Composite Index in April 2019, international investors have further enhanced their recognition of China's bond market and continued to increase their holdings of domestic RMB bonds.
“China's international balance of payments has maintained an overall balance and the external debt risk is under control. "
This journalist learned on September 27 from the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences that so far, Yunnan has effectively prevented the spread of Spodoptera Frugiperda, which has not broken out over a large area and caused disasters, and the province has also achieved periodical results in prevention and control work.
This January, Spodoptera Frugiperda was first found to have migrated from overseas regions to Jiangcheng County, Puer City, Yunnan Province, and confirmed to have occurred in 129 counties in the province, and had also spread to the hinterland regions of China, thereby posing a direct threat to China’s grain production.
Spodoptera Frugiperda is a major polyphagous agricultural pest insect that originated in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and can migrate over a long distance, and as stated in the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s global warning about this major migratory insect, it is “international, migrant, fulminant, and destructive”.
The insect threatens more than 80 crops, including corn, sugar cane and sorghum, and in cases of heavy feeding, may cause a yield loss of up to 70%.
It is difficult to defend against the insect, and China now has no registered pesticides that can prevent it.
After Spodoptera Frugiperda invaded Yunnan, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences sent Researcher Chen Aidong, who leads the provincial innovation team on collaborative and green control over cross-border agricultural pests under the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, to the front lines along with his team, where they performed a field survey, collected samples, and conducted technical instruction and demonstration.
Chen Aidong’s team first investigated the Spodoptera Frugiperda in respect to its population characteristics, natural enemy insect resources, the characteristics of overseas sources, its population’s migration characteristics, and the toxicity of pesticides and their prevention effect in crop fields.
They actively performed research into and applied green prevention technologies, and achieved over 90% prevention in pilot regions after introducing green new prevention techniques including population monitoring, trapping of adult insects, the scientific use of pesticide, and agricultural measures; at the same time, these measures reduced the use of chemical pesticides, protected natural enemy insect resources and the biological environment, and provided technical support for the province to realize effective control over the outbreaks of Spodoptera Frugiperda and related disasters, as well as offered sustainable treatment.
So far, Yunnan has effectively prevented Spodoptera Frugiperda, which has not broken out over a large area and thus caused a disaster, and the province has made periodical achievements in prevention and control work.
For its next step, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences will mainly investigate the ecological mechanism behind the migration, invasion, and outbreak of the population, and make breakthroughs in biological prevention and green preventive technology systems.
At the same time, they will actively carry out international cooperation and seek to build a key joint laboratory as well as a joint monitoring network and pilot area in overseas regions to enhance the province’s capacity to monitor and issue comprehensive warnings about Spodoptera Frugiperda.

White Paper: China Has Found A Development Path Suited To Its Actual Conditions
Beijing, September 27 (China News Service) The State Council Information Office of the People’s Republic of China released the white paper China and the World in the New Era on September 27.
The white paper says that over the past 70 years, China has been moving forward against all odds and exploring its path to development, and that the Chinese people have opened up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and achieved remarkable outcomes.
The white paper states that the key to China’s development lies in self-reliance and hard work.
China’s development lies in its down-to-earth spirit of “trading 800 million shirts for one Boeing”, which several generations of Chinese people have carried onward with ceaseless struggle, expended difficult-to-imagine effort, labor, and sweat; it also lies in its responsible spirit of “carrying one’s own burden”, through which China never makes trouble for others, transfers contradictions, buys or sells by force, or loots resources of other countries, neither in adversity or in prosperity; it also lies in its spirit of exploration of “crossing the river while feeling the stones on the bottom”, through which China discovered a development path with Chinese characteristics by adapting to the Chinese situation, drawing lessons from the past, drawing on all the outstanding achievements of human civilization, and making bold trials, rather than following old ways like imperialism and colonialism, nor following western development patterns.
The white paper states that China has developed in connection with the world, that China’s development is a positive force for global peace and development, and that the Chinese path suits China’s national conditions and adapts to demands of the time.
China safeguards world peace with actual deeds.
Over the past 70 years, China has never provoked any war or conflict, nor invaded any other country.
The white paper states that over the past 70 years, China has achieved great success in its development, the root cause of which is that China has found its development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and unwaveringly followed this path.
This path is established according to China’s national conditions and for the purpose of giving top priority to people’s interests, reforming and innovating, pursuing common development in opening up, and fully advancing the law-based governance.
As a large country with complex national conditions, China faced tremendous difficulties in governance, so without centralization and unification, as well as strong leadership, China might split up and bring catastrophe to the world.
The white paper also stated that over the past 70 years, China has overcome various risks and challenges and created a succession of numerous remarkable China miracles.
Especially since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China has made historic achievements and changes in its development, and has made a great leap from independence, to prosperity and strength, and now is closer to the great goal of the Chinese national rejuvenation than ever before.
This development path will lead China toward a promising future as time passes.

The Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center, the Tallest Building In Northern China, Has Been Completed, Creating More Than 100 National Patents
The completion ceremony for the Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center, the tallest building in northern China, was held in Binhai New District, Tianjin on the afternoon of the 26th, marking the success of a synergetic management platform based on high-precision BIM modeling, the building information modeling independently developed by the China Construction Eighth Engineering Division’s Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center Project Department, which won first prize at the AEC Excellence Awards in the field of skyscraper construction.
Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center, located in the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area, covers an area of 390,000 square meters and is 530 meters high, including 4 underground floors and 100 floors above the ground, and it is designed to serve diverse business needs including Grade-A offices, luxury apartments, and five-star plus hotels; upon completion, the project will become an important international landmark building in Tianjin.
The entire project consumed more than 70,000 tons of steel, about 376,000 meters of high-altitude butt welding (equivalent to 42.5x Mount Everest in height) enough welding wire to circle the Earth 40 times, and about 42,000 PCS of steel components, over 50% of which are super standard, including the world’s largest double-barreled oval steel pipe column with single-layer twist of 90°, said the manager in charge of the China Construction Eighth Engineering Division’s Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center Project Department.
The Tianjin Chow Tai Fook project is a steel structure of unprecedented complexity and processing difficulty.
Industry insiders said that the Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center is the first skyscraper project completed or under construction nationwide which comprehensively uses Building Information Modeling (BIM) management.
The project creatively proposed and successfully implemented the “three-total BIM application” model - total involvement, total professional applications, and total process implementation, and developed a synergetic management platform based on high-precision BIM modeling.
During the construction of the Chow Tai Fook project, the project department first built the BIM virtually, and then made scientific and error verifications before any real construction, thereby finding possible construction issues like modification and rework before they occurred, said the person in charge of the project.
In 2017, the BIM innovation achievements of the Chow Tai Fook Financial Center project won the AEC Excellence Awards first prize for construction groups at the Autodesk University & Award Ceremony.
During the construction of the project, the project department created a total of more than 130 national patents.
It’s worth mentioning that the BIM innovation achievements and technological innovations of the Tianjin Chow Tai Fook project not only optimized the complex and overelaborate construction links, they also shortened the construction duration by more than four months and enormously improved safety management.
Recently, the Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center project also won the International Safety Award (ISA) 2019.

Taiwan Scholars Suggest, Taiwanese Businesses Should Stay Close to the Mainland to Develop Mainstream Industries in an “Age of Uncertainty”
The Taiwan Business Innovation Operation Model Forum 2019 was held in Taipei on the 26th and 27th.
Many representatives of Taiwan businesses and scholars were invited to share their experiences in enterprise transformation, innovation, succession, and market development.
The forum was hosted by the Management Institute in Taipei, and organized by groups including the Capital Securities Corporation and the Outstanding Mainland and Taiwan Business Association.
The two-day meeting was divided into many seminars, covering transformation and upgrading models and business strategies, and more than 100 people attended the meeting.
With growing Sino-US trade friction, Taiwan Businesses are ushering in the “Age of Uncertainty”, said Ch’en Ming Chang, the president of the Management Institute in Taipei.
He believed that Taiwan businesses should keep abreast of the times and stay close to the mainland to develop mainstream industries, especially innovative products related to technology, culture, tourism, and health.
“Taiwan businesses have always valued quality, effectiveness, and delivery. ”
But Ch’en Ming Chang believed that simply following the conditions above is insufficient at present.
He said that Taiwan-funded enterprises must focus on both speed and service, speed up supply chain development, and pay attention to extended services and product life services.
Moreover, Taiwan businesses also need to work hard on “value-added service”.
Hsü Wen T’ang, the representative of Taiwan businesses from Guangdong and the chairman of Yayi Electronics Co., Ltd., said that Yayi Electronics was once ailing due to sudden decline of orders, but the group improved their operating conditions by adjusting structures and activating assets.
After transitioning from traditional electrical appliances to automotive electronic equipment, and entering the smart household appliances industry, the company spent three years before becoming profitable.
Pai Hung Chang, the general manager of Apollo (Zhuhai) Electronics Co., Ltd., suggested providing “one-stop” services to regular customers if there are difficulties in developing new customers.
The reasons why the customers replaced their suppliers are simply poor service, high price, low quality, slow delivery, low variety, and integrity problems, and as suppliers, we should solve these problems while rebuilding our production lines and diversifying our products to become irreplaceable suppliers.
On the 27th, the award ceremony of the “Outstanding Mainland and Taiwan Business Awards 2019”, hosted by Management Institute in Taipei, was held in Taipei.
Lui Cheng Chang, the general manager of Shanghai-based Golden Field, won the “Outstanding Taiwan Business and Cross-Strait Contribution Award”, Economic Daily News reported.
Comments on the new rules are invited: qualification is required for social capital to obtain the right of rural land management
Qualification is required for social capital to obtain the right of rural land management
Opinions are openly being solicited on the Measures for the Administration of Circulation of Rural Land Management Right to supervise the acquisition of land management rights by the circulation of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises
The website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs released an announcement yesterday on requesting public comment on the Measures for the Administration of Circulation of Rural Land Management Right (Draft for Comments)" (hereinafter referred to as "Draft"), to strengthen supervision and risk prevention in the circulation of rural land contracted management rights.
The Draft is open to the public for opinions as of today.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs announced that in order to implement the newly revised Rural Land Contract Law, further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system, and implement "separation of three rights" (the separation of rural land ownership, contract rights, and the right to manage the land), the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the Measures for the Administration of Circulation of Rural Land Contracted Management Right, and formed a Draft for Comments.
A reporter from Beijing Youth Daily learned that the published Draft contains many important amendments for the first time.
The newly revised Rural Land Contract Law defines the scope of land circulation, implements the concept of "separation of three rights", and sets up "rural land contracted management right" and "land management right" respectively, thereby establishing a clear distinction between the transfer, exchange, and transfer of land management rights (lease, subcontract, shareholding or other ways).
To implement the concept of "separation of three rights" and effectively implement the amendments made in the Rural Land Contract Law, and in consideration of the fact that differences exist between the circulation of land management rights and the exchange as well as transfer of rural land contracted management right in terms of parties, procedures, and supervision, the Draft defines the scope of transfer, focusing on the circulation of land management rights, including leasing and shareholding, and as such, the name of the regulation has been changed from "Measures for the Administration of Circulation of Rural Land Contracted Management Right" to " Measures for the Administration of Circulation of Rural Land Management Right".
The transfer and exchange of rural land contracted management rights will be regulated by separate management measures.
The Draft points out that under the "separation of three rights", farmers can only buy shares of the land management right for a certain period of time.
Theoretically, even if bankruptcy liquidation occurs, farmers will only suffer from the risk of losing the right of management, thus it is no longer necessary to stipulate that the contracted land should be returned to the original contractor, which is also in conflict with the Bankruptcy Law.
In order to prevent the risk of farmers losing land, various methods are adopted such as preferred stock, rent before stock, and repurchasing.
Considering that the preferred stock has a more mature theoretical basis in the Company Law, it is suggested that it should be taken as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of land loss.
