28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind spirit with a big heart.
His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.
He was the brother that went with the flow.
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.

The size of Italy's national debt has grown to record levels
In June 2016, the size of Italy's national debt exceeded 2.248 trillion euros.
The country's central bank stated that this number represents a historic high, RIA Novosti reports.
The previous unfavourable record was set in May of this year.
At that time, the size of the national debt had reached 2.228 trillion euros.
It is noted that, over the first six months of the year, Italy's debt load grew by 77.2 billion euros.
Earlier, it was reported that, at the end of 2015, Italy's national debt amounted to 132.7% of the country's GDP.
Meanwhile, Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, Pier Carlo Padoan, forecast a decrease in that figure to 130.9% in 2016, and to 123.4% of GDP in 2018.
141 victims of the terrorist attack at Domodedovo received payments from the airport.
141 people received charitable payments from the Aviatsionny Foundation, which was created by management at Domodedovo airport to help victims of the terrorist attack in 2011, Interfax reports.
According to the airport's press secretary, Alexander Vlasov, two other claims are currently under consideration.
‘The foundation is continuing to make charitable payments to victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and is providing comprehensive assistance to resolve ongoing issues’, added Vlasov, while recalling that a website for the foundation, which contains complete information on the process of rendering charitable assistance, was specifically created to facilitate interaction with the victims.
In 2011, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device in the international arrivals area at Domodedovo.
As a result of the terrorist attack, 37 people were killed and another 172 were injured.
Scientists have discovered an animal that can live for 500 years
An international team of biologists have come to the conclusion that the longest-living vertebrate is the Greenland shark, which can live for approximately 500 years, RT reports.
Scientists conducted radiocarbon analysis of the eye lenses of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, with a length exceeding five metres, could be between 272 and 512 years old.
The biologists believe that a slow metabolism, which results in slower development, plays an important role in the shark's longevity.
Female Greenland sharks only reach sexual maturity by the age of 150.
Previously, it was thought that the longest living of all the vertebrates was the shark's ‘neighbour’: the Greenland whale.
The oldest such specimen known to scientists was slightly older than 210 years.
Putin changed the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed a decree to amend the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, the Kremlin press service reported.
Earlier, it came to light that Putin had removed Sergei Ivanov from the post of chief of staff of the Presidential Executive Office, with Anton Vaino appointed as his successor.
Ivanov will now serve as Special Presidential Representative for Environmental Protection, Ecology, and Transport.
Deputy Secretary of the Council, Rashid Nurgaliyev, was excluded from the list of permanent members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
Sergei Ivanov, Anton Vaino, Presidential Plenipotentiary to the Siberian Federal District, Sergei Menyailo, and Plenipotentiary to the Northwestern Federal District, Nikolai Tsukanov, were included on the Council.
Sergei Ivanov is relieved of the post of chief of staff of the Presidential Executive Office.
Sergei Ivanov is relieved of the post of head of the Kremlin administration by a presidential decree.
Ivanov is appointed Special Representative of the Russian Federation for Environmental Protection, Ecology, and Transport.
Anton Vaino, who previously held the post of deputy to Sergei Ivanov, is appointed the new head of the administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov personally asked to be transferred to another job.
Is it worth going to a health resort if you don't have any health problems?
Our expert: Head doctor of a health resort, Olga Bogush.
If a person is healthy, but just burnt-out from work, should they bother going to a health resort?
A health resort vacation is essential to us not only in terms of treatment, but also for the prevention of illnesses.
In the setting of a health resort, a person can check the state of their body and receive recommendations from a doctor about how to live so that their health does not fall apart.
These types of recommendations are useful to everyone.
‘I'm just burnt-out from work’, is an important signal from the body that shouldn't be dismissed.
Constant stress and mental and physical exhaustion can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
But about 90% of visitors feel stressed.
Moreover, the people who are most susceptible to it are from large cities and between the ages of 45 and 55.
So, it's best to not compound matters and give yourself time to relax before it’s too late.
Studies show that 98% of people lower their biological age during a stay at a health resort.
Modern health resorts offer a comfortable stay for the whole family.
So, if you want to spend your vacation with the children, you won't have to part ways with them.
Wellness programmes are available for children, even the very youngest, which include not only diagnostic services, consultations with a paediatrician, and tests, but also therapeutic services.
For example: swimming (there are children's pools at many health resorts), inhalation therapy, specialised dietary regimes, massage, oxygen cocktails, and physiotherapy.
A doctor determines a course of treatment taking into account patient-specific indications and the particular characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, health resorts usually offer a children's club with activity coordinators, where children can explore play activities and various workshops.
Some health resorts even open their doors to guests with infants, providing babies with the necessary conditions and offering the services of an experienced nanny.
Mild winters, long summers, and an abundance of sunny days each year (more than 300) create the perfect conditions for year-round recreation at the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.
After all, the body needs rest not only during the summertime.
So, there's no need to fear the weather outside, especially since the majority of procedures are conducted indoors and are in no way dependant on the season.
In general, it is advisable to undergo treatment at a health resort 2 times a year, especially for people of a mature age.
The main draw of the Caucasian Mineral Waters region is, of course, its healing mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Yessentuki, and Narzan.
Their waters possess unique properties and act on different systems of the body.
The water differs in terms of temperature, the amount of salt, total mineralisation, and chemical and gas composition.
A doctor chooses the water depending on the patient’s wellbeing.
For example, Narzan has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and repairs the function of the gastrointestinal tract and the metabolism.
Yessentuki-4 affects the gastrointestinal tract and reduces blood sugar levels.
New Yessentuki offers anti-inflammatory, choleretic, and diuretic effects.
The water at Slavyanovsky has the same effect.
When prescribing water treatment, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, they choose water with a lower salt content, because the salts retain liquid, which leads to increased blood pressure.
The consumption of mineral water requires adherence to a regime: the water should be drunk at a particular time, in a required amount, and at a specific temperature.
Nowadays, various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are also available at health resorts.
What kinds of health treatments, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, are available at resorts in the region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is the Tambukan salt lake, the silt mud from which is beneficial for the joints, spine, and internal organs.
It offers anti-inflammatory, resolving, and immunomodulatory effects.
Then there are constitutional walks along individually tailored routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is the huge Resort Park (the second largest in Europe).
They are popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in close proximity to the Narzan mineral spring.
There, you can also take baths in wine, pearls, iodine-bromine, selenium, and sage-liquorice, depending on what the doctor prescribes for you.
Extending the fruiting period.
What can be done to make the harvest last until the end of the season?
Yuliya Belopukhova, an agronomist and dacha dweller, explains.
It's time to give those tall tomato plants a trim: remove the new shoots, cut off the top of the plant, and remove all the leaves up to the second-to-last cluster with fruit and blossoms with small young fruit – they won't have time to ripen.
We top-dress all tomatoes, regardless of their ‘type’, as well as peppers and eggplant, with an ash-superphosphate extract and treat them with biologicals (Dozrevatel, to speed up the ripening and growth of the fruit; Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Baktofit, to ward off diseases; Immunotsitofit, to strengthen immunity; and Bitoxybacillin, Lepidocide, Fitoverm, if there are pests).
At the end of summer, the only chemical products that should be used are copper sulphate, colloidal sulphur, and insecticidal soap.
We do the final watering of the plants.
In the greenhouse, we lower the long climbing cucumbers from the trellis so that the lower bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) is laying on the ground, then we water it with a warm water and Zircon solution, and cover the stem in 5-7 cm of compost.
Extending the fruiting period of squash is also easy: cut off the old leaves, water it with warm water and a multinutrient fertiliser solution, and add some nutrient-rich soil under the bush.
To protect against night-time cold, drape material over the garden bed.
Keep the plants uncovered during the day, but cover them after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs that Russia is emerging from the longest recession of the past twenty years.
As noted by the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, Russia's GDP is showing improvement: in the second quarter, GDP declined by 0.8% in annual terms.
This figure represents the smallest decline since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, Russia's economic contraction slowed to 0.6% in the second quarter.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade also recently spoke about the stabilising situation.
Slow growth ahead.
According to experts from the Central Bank of Russia, the Russian economic recession is a thing of the past.
‘The index rating of Russia's GDP indicates that the recession is behind us, and that slow economic growth is ahead’, says a bulletin from the Bank of Russia called ‘What the trends indicate’.
Experts from the regulatory authority increased the GDP estimate model for the current quarter to 0.4%, while the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade reported that Russia's GDP stopped contracting in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally adjusted decline in GDP amounted to 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But over the course of the quarter, the decline stopped: it amounted to 0.2% in April, while in May and June, the change in GDP was within the range of 0-0.15%’, RIA Novosti quotes the spokesperson from the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade as saying.
The slowdown in the rate of contraction of the Russian economy over the past five quarters suggests that the ‘bottom has already been passed’.
Bloomberg names the growth in demand for electricity and rail transport, as well as the revival of business among other markers that point to signs of recovery in the national economy.
If you take into account the fact that it's a leap year, it is clear that the trend of a 1% increase in the consumption of electricity can be partially attributed to the additional workday.
Then, we'll factor in the colder than average annual temperatures in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight traffic, but here it's difficult to obtain accurate data, and an increase or decrease of 0.5% in semi-annual volume could also be explained by seasonal factors’, explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
On the other hand, there are other more obvious signs of stabilisation of the Russian economy.
For example, a decline in price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index amounted to 7.2%, compared to 15.6% for the same month last year.
Moreover, Rosstat has recorded deflation over the past two weeks.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamic of the rouble exchange rate, despite displaying high volatility at the beginning of the year, it strengthened by 12% between the beginning of the year and August.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which indicators in the real economy should follow’, underscores Yakovenko.
In addition to this, since April, there has been growth in the volume of industrial output in the Russian Federation.
In June, this figure rose by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover has slowed from -32.8% in January 2016, to -20.7% in May.
A positive trend is also evident in the labour market, where the rate of unemployment fell to 5.4%.
The only time it has been lower was in September 2015 (5.2%).
In spite of the favourable situation in the labour market, the issue of real disposable incomes leaves a lot to be desired.
In annual terms, this figure has declined by 4.8%.
This factor could slow down the economic recovery, given that household spending represents a sizeable contribution to GDP.
As a rule, its share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50%.
In addition to weak consumption, the Bank of Russia's strict policy could also be mentioned in terms of other risk factors for economic growth.
The regulatory authority has held rates at 10.5%, which doesn't have the best impact on the real sector.
Inadequate levels of investment are also a negative factor, as this hinders development of industrial capacity.
Overall, however, we can assume that by the end of the year, the rate of decline in the Russian economy will slow to -0.5%, compared to -3.7% in 2015’, says Irina Rogova, an analyst with Forex Club.
The process of naturalisation of athletes, which has recently taken-off in Russian football and was well established in the winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, is still not as extensively developed in summer sports.
If former foreigners are also competing for Russia at the Olympic Games in Rio, then in the majority of cases, we are talking about natives of countries that were former republics of the Soviet Union.
However, in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process: a sufficiently large number of Russians are competing under the flags of other states.
In each case, the story behind the change of nationality is different.
Some were brought to a different country by their parents during childhood, leaving no choice.
Some couldn't successfully compete for a spot on the Russian team.
While some thought that there would be better conditions to improve in their sport abroad.
AiF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In the German passport of the 27-year-old girl, it is written that her name is Lisa Ryzih.
Previously, however, it was, of course, Elizaveta.
She was born in 1988, in the city of Omsk.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to immigrate to Germany.
The young girl didn't have a choice.
There, she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister and pursue track and field.
Just like her sister, Lisa chose pole vaulting.
If she had stayed in Russia, it is doubtful she could have ‘usurped the thrown’ of Yelena Isinbayeva.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio, Lisa will be the only one of our countrywomen, even if only a former one, in the pole vault event.
Her highest achievements in this sport are bronze at the 2010 European Championships and silver at the continental competition in 2016, which she won, once again, amidst Yelena Isinbayeva's absence.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious proselytisers of an evangelical branch.
For the most part, they left for the United States, because of their religion, when the young girl was just three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena already started to get involved in wrestling in school.
Producing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where she continued to practice at the US Training Centre for Wrestling, under the guidance of another former Russian citizen, Vladislav Izboinikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her very first fight.
But then, at the World Championships that same year, she had a victory.
Prior to this, in fact, she managed to win silver at the World Championships in 2010.
After this, there was a bronze in 2013 and a silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first became acquainted with synchronised swimming.
However, it wouldn't be right to say that our coaches in Russia trained her.
Soon afterwards, the girl's family decided to immigrate to the United States and settle down in the city of Colorado.
Maria continued her training there.
Soon thereafter, she joined the US team and made an excellent showing at the Pan American Games.
Of course, she couldn't compete at the intensive international level of Russian synchronised swimming, but for America, her results were at the very top.
Kristen Shaldybin, which sounds odd in Russian, received her new name at 11 years of age, when her parents decided to continue the girl's training in rhythmic gymnastics overseas.
Up to that point, the girl was engaged in her favourite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
Having immigrated to the United States, she quickly joined that country's youth team, and later also pushed her way into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
Of course, she wasn't in contention for first place on the world stage, but she staged a real breakthrough for the United States, taking the team of stars and stripes into the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another one of our former ‘rhythmic gymnasts’ is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who competes for Team Germany.
Jana was born in Tolyatti.
In 2008, when the girl was only 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany: there, the girl had a better chance of making it onto the national team.
It didn't take long before she was representing her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, however, Jana was only able to take 17th place, which was not enough to get into the final competition in the individual event.
On the other hand, in the two years prior to this, she, in fact, managed to win a bronze medal at the Youth Olympic Games.
There is another gymnast, but this time, an artistic gymnast: Irina Sazonova.
If the immigration route of the already-mentioned gymnasts could be called conventional, then the choice of Irina's family was very unusual: Iceland.
Ira is an alumna of a Volgograd sport school.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became national champion.
Truth be told, Ira still trains in Russia: she comes home specifically so that she doesn't lose her skills.
In Rio, she didn't perform as well as she would have liked.
Her best placing was 40th in the individual all-around.
There is extremely little information about the swimmer, Maria Ugolkova, in the Russian infosphere.
Maria has been living and training in Switzerland for a very long time.
However, for quite a long time, she was competing under the Russian flag and producing some decent results: there was even a national record in the 200 metre butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and started competing under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance was 14th place in the 4x100 m freestyle relay.
In order to get to the Games, the girl started a crowdfunding project, through which she managed to collect around 6,000 francs, which enabled her to pay for her preparations for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle wrestler, Adam Batirov, spent virtually his entire career under the Russian flag.
During that time, the native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time winner of the European Championships, Russian champion, and an international class Master of Sports of Russia.
When he stopped making it onto our national team, the time had come to start thinking about changing nationality.
For several years, the talented fighter disappeared from the sporting podium.
His triumphant comeback happened at the 2016 Asian Championships: Batirov was already representing Bahrain, for whom he won a gold medal and got a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
Back home, there is even less known about another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, than about Swiss swimmer, Maria Ugolkova.
The fact of the matter is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It is there that Mikhail started to get involved in artistic gymnastics.
He didn't achieve great success at the international level.
In Rio, his best performance was 40th place in the qualification round on the parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympics in artistic gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Nastya, who was born in Moscow in 1985, was just 9 years old, her family immigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued to train in synchronised swimming, performing very well at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronised swimming.
In a duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum, Anastasia took eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo programme.
Just like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kroyter competes for Team Israel.
When the boy was just 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry had already become national champion.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Kroyter also won gold at the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to high jump, Dmitry also does long jump and triple jump.
31-year-old Albert is another native of Khasavyurt, who, after a long time of competing for Russia, decided to switch his sport nationality.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, whom he will also represent in Rio.
In Russia, he competed for the School of Higher Sports Mastery in Krasnoyarsk, and, in 2011, even became national champion.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow into the family of a member of the USSR's volleyball team, Yaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognised as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon thereafter, he decided to continue his career in Italy.
There, the family remained as permanent residents.
In 2015, as a part of the national team, he became the bronze medal winner at the European Championships, which were held in his new homeland.
Khadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994, and got stuck with his family in the midst of the war.
After ten years, his parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it wasn't possible to get into this northern country, and they had to go to France, to Nice.
There, Zelimkhan continued to study freestyle wrestling.
Soon thereafter, he won the Junior World Championship, and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative for France in the wrestling tournament.
And once again it's freestyle wrestling, and once again it's a former Russian citizen.
But this time, the story is about a native of North Ossetia who immigrated to Spain: it's about Taimuraz Friev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and, currently, he competes for this country's national team.
Before this, of course, the 30-year-old athlete also managed to produce very good results in Russia.
He became the bronze medal winner at the National Championships in 2007 and 2008.
Tired of not making it onto the team, Taimuraz decided to change sports nationality.
The last on our list is a Chechen boxer, Arthur Biyarslanov, born in the capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala, in 1995.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, started to box.
Since then, Arthur has become Canadian Champion three times over, and, in 2012, he became the World Youth Champion.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won gold at the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.
The Chief of Staff of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation is Aton Vaino.
On Friday, 12 August, Vladimir Putin appointed Anton Vaino as Chief of Staff of the Executive Office of the President of Russia.
Previously, Sergei Ivanov held this post.
‘The head of state appointed Anton Vaino as Chief of Staff of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation by decree, relieving him of his current post’, reads a decree signed by Putin and published on the Kremlin website.
Since May 2012, Vaino has been Deputy Chief of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation.
Anton Eduardovich Vaino was born on 17 February 1972, in Tallinn.
His father, Eduard Vaino, is Chairman of the Cuba-Russia Business Council of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation and Vice President of External Relations and Cooperation with Shareholders at OAO AvtoVAZ.
His grandfather, Karl Vaino, was First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Estonia from 1978 to 1988.
In 1996, he graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Faculty of International Relations.
From 1996 to 2001, he worked in the Russian Embassy in Japan and then in the Second Asian Department at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
From 2002 to 2004, he held various posts in the Russian Presidential Protocol Directorate.
From 2004 to 2007, he was Deputy Head of the Russian Presidential Protocol Scheduling Directorate.
In 2007, he was First Deputy Head of the Russian Presidential Protocol Directorate.
From October 2007 to April 2008, he was Deputy Chief of the Government Staff of the Russian Federation.
On 25 April 2008, he was appointed Chief of the Prime Minister's Protocol and Deputy Chief of the Government Staff of the Russian Federation.
On 27 December 2011, he became a Minister of the Russian Federation as Chief of the Government Staff of the Russian Federation.
On 22 May 2012, he was appointed Deputy Chief of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation.
He is fluent in English and Japanese.
He is a Class 1 Active State Advisor to the Russian Federation (this rank was assigned by a Decree of the President of the Russian Federation on 22 January 2008)
He received a Russian Federation Presidential Certificate of Honour (16 February 2012) for his service in support of the work of the government of the Russian Federation and many years of diligent work.
He received a Russian Federation Presidential Certificate of Gratitude (24 November 2005) for his service in the preparation and implementation of celebratory events dedicated to the 60th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War.
He is married and has a son.
Why should the children of Cossacks have classes at schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, 'Cossacks need to be educated not with campaigns and parades, but in a systematic manner'.
They should grow up and, at the very least, from the age of 7, understand that they are Cossacks and their education should be Cossack.
But so far this work, it seems to me, is being carried out as a mere formality, and, I suspect, primarily just on paper.
If Cossack classes incorporate everything positive that has been previously accumulated and take it to a whole new level, then I will be pleased.
If everything is done in a hurry and without knowing how to go about it, then this new idea will result in cheap populism.
Housing and communal services continue to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
There is evidence of misappropriation of funds that are earmarked for public utilities from budgets at various levels.
According to the Prosecutor General's Office, artificially high prices are one of the most common crimes in the sphere of housing and communal services.
As a result, consumers in the region overpaid power suppliers by more than 170 million roubles.
The other day, the Prosecutor's Office for Krasnodar Krai also became aware of the fact that unjustified costs were included in the prices.
While the expenses of OOO IV-Consulting (supplies cold water) show that 4 million roubles were spent hiring cars at above-market prices.
And there are a host of examples like this throughout the country.
The people are handing over their last rouble to ‘public utilities’ and, what's more, they are paying in a timely manner: according the Ministry of Construction, Housing, and Utilities of the Russian Federation, the average collection rate is 94% of the population.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code at once: embezzlement, money laundering, abuse of power, and so forth.
According to investigators, as head of a fund that was involved in the repair of city facilities, Makarov entered into contracts with business owners who did not actually perform work, but were still paid.
The businessmen simply returned a large portion of the money to him.
While, as the owner of a property management company, Makarov collected money from the population, but didn't pay service providers and used the money for his own purposes.
As a result, damages to the budget and residents are in the millions of roubles.
Makarov's fraudulent scheme is sadly typical of Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of directors of property management companies, who embezzled citizens' money, has swept across the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kokhan continues; incidentally, he is also a former city council member and is accused of fraud amounting to 91.7 million roubles.
According to investigators, between 2012 and 2013, he established 6 property management companies and created 3 limited liability companies in Elizovo in Kamchatka Krai.
One of them carried out contractual work for a property management company, while the other two played the role of payment processing centres, that is, they took money from the population.
However, A. Kokhan never transferred the funds to the power suppliers, but spent it on his precious self.
It's fairly difficult to litigate in the housing and communal services sector.
Cases aren't opened or drag on.
And very complicated housing legislation ‘helps’ with this, figures Svetlana Razvorotneva, Executive Director of the non-profit partnership, Housing Control.
We don't have time to start working on one law, before we devise a new one that is necessary to get the previous one to work.
There are also too few experts, including judges, in the area of housing and communal services.
Lawyers themselves acknowledge that housing law is given very little attention at universities.
Refusals to initiate criminal proceedings and red tape during investigations are even reported in the Prosecutor General's Office.
Of the 3,500 pending criminal cases in 2015, less than half made it to trial.
In the rest of the cases, the investigations took on a protracted nature, and every fifth case was suspended in connection with failure to identify the accused party.
It is not uncommon that mistakes made by law enforcement officials are written off by them on gaps in the current legislation.
The law exists, but inquiry bodies are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of forgery, but only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
In the first 5 months of this year, their number has only slightly increased to 99.
But what is meant by the falsification of tenants meeting minutes?
It means: a change in the management of the building, and financial and other issues that circumvent the opinion of the owners.
But it also means that ordinary companies, that want to work honestly and don't ‘milk’ the population, can't break into the housing and communal services market.
It turns out that tenants are losing out, and so are small and medium businesses.
Primarily, due to the eradication of corruption, in and of itself, throughout the state, assures Anton Zharkov, a member of the Duma Committee on property issues.
And currently, this work is actively underway.
It's not just isolated actions: it's a deliberate policy of fighting corruption.
Of course, not all regions are in such a sad state.
In particular, there are no signs of scandal in the capital.
Why are there no such scandals in the housing and communal services sector in Moscow, as there are in many other regions?
Well, because the city government has shown an iron will and has established order, Anatoly Vyborny, a member of the Duma Committee for security and combating corruption, told AiF.
I am referring to personnel issues, legislative amendments, and legal education.
Close supervision of property management companies has been instituted and they have all gone through the licensing process.
Citizens' complaints are dealt with promptly and in full public view (and the appeals of residents and responsive measures are posted on the internet portal of the Government of Moscow).
Many people not only pay their monthly bills, but also keep a close eye on what is written on them, and how the building is being maintained.
The public's awareness about the rights of owners and the responsibilities of resource-supplying and property management organisations is very high.
Plus, Moscow checks the reasonableness of rates for housing and communal services, because a sizeable portion of budgetary funds goes towards subsidies and benefits for a multitude of population categories.
Probably, all of this is what explains the calm situation in Moscow.
So, it turns out that everything depends on the will of regional authorities?
Perhaps the weak-willed should change jobs?
The Turkish gambit.
Can Erdogan forgo a friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has given an ultimatum to the United States, demanding a choice be made between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organising the coup.
He announced this while speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdoğan urged the Americans to withdraw support for the Fethullah Terrorist Organisation.
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States is urged to change its position.
Experts believe that the rift in Turkey's relations with the West is continuing to grow and could lead to another attempt to change power in the country.
‘Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO (Fethullah Terrorist Organisation).
Either FETO, which organised the coup, or democratic Turkey.
They must make this choice’, the Anatolian Agency quotes Erdoğan as saying in an appeal made on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but this time more sternly, urged the United States to comply with his demand, which he first voiced immediately after quelling the rebellion.
To recall, on the night of 16 July, in Turkey, an attempt was made by high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army to overthrow the country's legitimate government, and an attempt on the life of the head of state was also made.
However, after Recep Erdoğan made an appeal to the people, the rebellion was quelled, and its organisers and participants were arrested.
In total, about 8 thousand people fell under suspicion, including, in addition to military personnel, the likes of teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdoğan, Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States, acted as their mentor.
Erdoğan's supporters have also suggested that the Americans might also have been directly involved in the coup.
The United States has denied all the accusations made against it, refuses to extradite Gülen, and has advised a change in tone.
The most recent statement on this matter from representatives of the State Department were made at the time of Erdoğan's visit to Saint Petersburg this past Tuesday.
However, this is not stopping the President of Turkey, who is stubbornly sticking to his guns and is also making demands on his other Western partners.
‘Ankara will stop fulfilling its obligations under the migration agreement with the EU if Brussels does not set a date for the cancellation of visa restrictions on Turkish citizens’, Turkey’s Minister for EU Affairs, Ömer Çelik, stated on 9 August.
According to him, the introduction of amendments to the anti-terrorism law by Ankara, as required by the EU, would put the internal security of Europe at risk.
Note that, on 1 August, Sigmar Gabriel, Vice Chancellor of Germany, demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with threats to open the borders to migrants, in order to achieve a simplification of the visa regime with the EU.
His words were in response to a corresponding statement from Turkey’s Foreign Minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu.
Çavuşoğlu made another provocative statement this past Wednesday, suggesting that Turkey may withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not rule out that the country would consider the possibility of leaving the alliance if they didn't receive the expected support from it.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence sector is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign states in the area of defence, that import missiles’, Çavuşoğlu stated in an interview with Anadolu Agency.
According to him, Turkey, from now on, needs to create its own defence system based on its own technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
‘Up until now, Turkey had been trying to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have been disappointing, and we have started to look for other partners’, the minister said.
Experts believe that all of this speaks to the serious differences between Turkey and the West, and the country's reorientation towards the East.
Director of the International Institute for Political Expertise, Evgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdoğan is playing his game right now and can't afford a serious confrontation with the West.
He is very much tied to the West both in terms of business and in terms of the military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think that Erdoğan will try to find a balance, while preserving the framework of relations with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for the Americans to have a completely obedient person in this post’, the expert explained to AiF.
According to him, it can't be ruled out that, following the Turkish leader's statements (about the non-payment of compensation to the EU, demands for a visa-free space with Europe, and the extradition of Gülen from the United States), he will come under pressure.
‘Recep Erdoğan will be faced with a deterioration of relations with America and the European Union, and, in particular, they will apply pressure on him in terms of humanitarian issues, dictatorial methods of governance, and so on’, Minchenko believes.
Director of the Centre for Political Information, Alexey Mukhin, concedes that the President of Turkey will change his point of view on relations with Russia as soon as it's in his interests to do so.
Eight months ago, Erdoğan took a very tough stance against Russia and sought favour in the West by any means.
For a very short time, the situation has been reversed.
There are no guarantees that, after some time, the President of Turkey won't change his priorities once again.
I think that Erdoğan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
Having found himself between the two poles of the West and Russia, he will try to seek maximum benefit for himself’, Mukhin believes.
In his opinion, right now, the main task of the President of Turkey is to hold onto political power in the country, and this is precisely why he needs Russia and a partnership with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States stops supporting Gülen.
Both the EU and United States need Turkey, with whose help they are controlling the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached’, the expert believes.
A different point of view is espoused by Anna Glazova, Head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East.
Currently, Turkey's relations with both the EU and the United States are quite tense, and this is connected, first and foremost, with the domestic policies being pursued by Erdoğan himself.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen and, against the backdrop of this crisis, Turkey's leaders will try to carry out a reset of policy in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It's no accident that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, claim they are willing to change their stance on a whole range of issues related to Syria, differences with Israel have been settled, and active political engagement with Iran is currently underway’, Glazova explained to AiF, suggesting that Erdoğan's next step will be the normalisation of relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy currently being carried out by Erdoğan is a return to the foreign policy concept that was being pursued by Turkey before the start of the Arab revolutions.
‘It was then, from a position of "zero problems with neighbours" that Turkey began to actively develop its relations in the Middle East and Asia’.
The President of Turkey just finished very successful visits to Russia and African countries.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will continue to evolve and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey's position both in the regional and international arena’, the expert believes.
Glazova believes that it would be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to the previous relationship with EU; the question right now is whether or not the EU will start to get tough in response to Turkey, which could resort to opening the borders to migrants and, as such, create serious problems for Europe.
Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.
The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended.
He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.
But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also turned since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He's denied that emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.
They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.
"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.
It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.
But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.
He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
I'm very emotional because my family are here as well
I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see.
He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.
It has been a rollercoaster ride.
Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.
Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.
And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.
Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but gave no reason.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian).
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.
Do the smiles convince?
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.
So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
No-one knows yet.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.
In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.
Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson sacked after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Thursday before his termination was announced.
There were creative differences on the set and a disagreement.
I regret that it occurred," he said in a statement.
Details on how Gibson's character will be written out of the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, is expected to come at a later date, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statement.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred on the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been on the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I had hoped to see it through to the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would just like to say thank you to the writers, producers, actors, our amazing crew, and, most importantly, the best fans that a show could ever hope to have.
The show is slated to return for its twelfth season on 28 September.
Mystery as fish land in Banff garden
A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
Happily, it all went very well.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men are 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew saw the incident unfold in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim to safety while their boat continued under its own power.
"We saw their boat circling close to them and imagined the worst," said Moelfre lifeboat helm Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, by the time we had launched, the strong winds had blown it clear of them," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a lifejacket.
They were all taken on board the inshore lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station
Mr Jones said: "The three men thrown in the water are lucky to be alive and completely uninjured.
The boat's engine had an emergency kill cord but it had somehow come detached from the person driving the boat when it capsized.
Someone was watching over these guys today.
Pokémon Go a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world turns.
That teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been the lament of many for the the past decade.
Pokemon Go is getting people off the couch and into some activity.
Screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones.
So it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive.
I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs).
Like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive response, which overloaded servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players on smartphones go out looking for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be 'photographed' (via a screenshot on your phone) or 'captured'.
A generation who played the game when younger have joined the craze, jumping off the couch for the search.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game launching, the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels.
Many public health campaigns to get people to "find 30," "get off the couch" and "be active everyday" have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable.
Yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy.
Thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people are even making new friends on the hunt.
As usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to complain about.
And yes somebody might walk into a door.
So what?
A breakthrough has occurred.
For while smartphone apps like Fitbit could previously track our activity, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does.
The novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course.

Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Dynamic on vault.
Effortless on beam.
Jaw-dropping on floor.
Brilliant all over.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.
Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.
Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.
United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.
While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.
She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.
Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The gunman fired as many as eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car then fled in another vehicle, the report states.
Police say the triple killing doesn't appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn't take purses or $2,900 in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was tied to four earlier attacks.
In all, seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period.
"It's occurring within a residential area in front of a home," Howard said to CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including as a late-1990s brown Nissan, a late-1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police that it wasn't unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an unoccupied pickup truck just a half-hour before the triple killing and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder his mom Elizabeth Picciuto didn't know about while pregnant.
When he first came home my initial thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told Edmund might never recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institutionalized.
"My first response was 'I didn't think people did that anymore,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund didn't sit up or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly meeting some milestones.
He's walking with help, and riding a bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers, and singing.
Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund made up for "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not just typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic ones like Edmund's, and infections during pregnancy from viruses like measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.
It's too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future.
I kept saying, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I actually haven't asked for a prognosis in forever, because I don't expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from Zika.
It gets better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding prompts rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana lead the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected over the state through Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi were overflowing their banks and threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials, and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipahoa Parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area.
In south Alabama, a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set record crests over the weekend.
Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that flooding downstream in Ascension Parish is a threat, as those swollen rivers will be slow to drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says waters from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose quickly overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.
"We woke up and the water kept on coming," Hansford said.
It came up to my waist.
His wife told Hansford that it's the highest she's seen the creek in the 48 years she's lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were sheltering Friday.
Krautmann says flooding is "quickly becoming widespread" as heavy rains continue, saying officials are considering evacuation orders.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and street flooding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said.
CBS affiliate WWL reports that an alderwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches but both are now flooding.
Parish President Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water.
Shelters have been opened in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond to house those who were evacuated.
"They will be allowed to return home once the water starts to recede," he said.
In the Tangipahoa Parish city of Hammond, close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water, and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.
This one is on track to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued on the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of houses were reported as flooded Thursday, but none have been reported so far Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in some places I have never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming down."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.
"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
Family tells the station he is expected to recover.
He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.
Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.
It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.
First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.
The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This is powerful.
Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.
To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government.
This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.
If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.
Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.
If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.
And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report
A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today.
Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote.
Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.
Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.
He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting.
Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.
Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.
He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.
And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.
'I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe besides the facial hair,' Brady told Huffington Post.
'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.
Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor
Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.
Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind the pair's similar looks
One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'
Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'.
Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'
Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf
CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.
We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.
That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'
'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'
Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.
To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'
She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'
Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.
'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.
'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.'
'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.'
All the product in question has been removed from sale.
How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.
Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.
If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.
Sounds tricky?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.
Traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue along Europe's dirtiest places for travel guide
A British traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his tongue along a Euro note, a Piccadilly Circus hand rail, a train toilet's flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself, and us, just what he was getting in to.
But the experiment, which has be made into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, threw up some surprising results.
The thought of licking a train's flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly repellent, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
All the way along his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the durability of his gut by travelling around the world and eating weird and wonderful things.
From public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system
In the movie made about it he said: 'Ever since I was a kid I have been fairly carefree with my health and I've put all sorts of things in my mouth from soil, eating worms and muddy water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he turned down was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.
By comparison, freshly washed hands should come in under 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet he refused to lick after his luminometer count was over 4000 units, when freshly washed hands are less than 60
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have produced the traveller's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom
He said in the film: 'That is close to one of the worst things I have smelled in a toilet.'
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in conjunction with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help boost people's gut bacteria and immune systems.
Valio's Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juice and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We did a lot of crazy brainstorming that ended in the idea "let's call Ian."
They claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's linked to the immune system.
Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let's put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I asked him to, like the disgusting Russian toilet that's shown in the film.'
Naturally some things were easier to get Ian to lick, some were pretty tough.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks caught on tape.'
In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction
A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.
There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.
This family are notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.
Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished
Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past
Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.
One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'
We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.
The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.
The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal are left terrified as a low-flying military jet flies skims beach
Tourists sun worshipping in Aveiro, Portugal, had the shock of their lives
A Portuguese air force P-3C Orion plane swooped in incredibly low
The air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety
This is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low-flying jet swooped down over a packed beach.
Dramatic footage showed the military plane almost coming within touching distance of sunseekers on the stretch of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Holidaymakers rose to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the jet engines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the clouds.
The incident happened in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by onto social media, said: 'It passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to crash.'
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me.'
Tourists on the beach at Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the murk and flew at an incredibly low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them.
He said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires, but the air force insisted no-one's safety had been compromised.
Wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer as well as killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force said today the pilot had to fly low because of the conditions - thick fog and smoke from wildfires - which obscured his visibility
The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
The HACCP system has been mandatory for food services for more than a year already, but it still hasn't been implemented in the majority of cafes and restaurants in Saint Petersburg.
Inspections are becoming more prevalent and a business faces fines of up to 1 million roubles.
For more than a year already, conformance with the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system (HACCP, KhASSP in the Russian version) – an analysis of risks and critical control points – has been mandatory for manufacturers and transporters of food, as well as for companies in the field of food services in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CU).
In Saint Petersburg, inspections of businesses, by Rospotrebnadzor, for compliance with these standards started in February 2015.
But so far, officials are only issuing fines for specific violations of the rules (see ‘The List of Documents’...).
Failure to comply with the regulations as a whole will cost a company 600,000 roubles for the first violation and 1 million roubles for the second.
HACCP was developed in the United States in the 1960s as a system that takes into account the risks of working with food and how to prevent them.
At that time, the issue at stake was the safety of food for astronauts.
Today, the system is used in all food enterprises, not only in United States, but also in Canada and in the European Union.
HACCP has been in force within the CU since February 2015.
Businesses were given 4 years to develop and implement the system (the HACCP requirement first appeared in the technical regulations of the CU in 2011).
However, both business owners themselves and officials acknowledge that the majority of companies have not even heard about this standard.
Unfortunately, for a long time, we were convinced that the standard only applied to food production and not restaurateurs, explained Elena Tsereteli, Head of the Public Council.
Now, everyone is trying to make up for lost time.
The expected timeframe for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is between the end of August and the beginning of September.
But this won't lead to a spike in demand, since the core market, families with children, are already getting ready for school, experts point out.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies sent a letter to the government yesterday with a request to now allow charters.
‘For many Russian tourists, selecting affordable, quality seaside vacations is still an unresolved issue, because, in the resort towns of Krasnodar Krai and the Republic of Crimea, the majority of accommodation facilities are already booked up until the end of September’, note the authors of the letter, while emphasising that the establishment of charter operations in August would not significantly affect existing demand for Russian seaside tourism products.
The North-West Division Office of the Russian Union of Travel Industry (RUTI) has reported that, if aviation authorities in Russia and Turkey are able to come to a decision quickly, then the resumption of charter flights to Turkey could be expected within a month.
There is still no clear understanding of when charters will resume; it ultimately depends on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes could start flying in September, even in August, if tour operators quickly put together packages and reach an agreement with airline companies regarding the required flight paths’, says said Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects for the North-West Division Office of RUTI.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but it won't seriously affect the balance of power in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are getting ready for school or are spending their holidays in other countries.
In the autumn season, tours are mainly purchased by individual travellers or couples.
Charter packages can count on those who have the ability to spontaneously take a vacation’, says Pavel Rumyantsev.
‘Turkey has a chance to attract lots of tourists if it provides very budget-friendly offers – 50-60 thousand roubles for a trip for two – because there are people who intentionally wait for very cheap tours’, says Valery Rosenthal, CEO of Optio-Travel travel agency.
Otherwise, there's no sense in counting on a buying frenzy; the majority of travel has already been planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that, because there is demand for scheduled flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but there is no sense in expecting a buying frenzy.
‘For Turkey, the launch of charters right now is a rehearsal for next season’, says Pavel Rumyantsev.
‘The establishment of charters to Turkey is good news for the next season’, agrees Valeriya Rubtsova.
The tax code provides for an exemption from personal income tax as established in accordance with legislation on compensation payments within the bounds of established rules related to indemnity for damage caused by injury or another impairment to health.
Milk is issued to workers engaged in harmful labour conditions according to the established rules prescribed in Article 222 of the Labour Code of the Russian Federation.
Furthermore, the rules and conditions for issuance are established by Order No. 45N of the Ministry of Health of Russia of 16.02.2009.
According to this document, free milk, or other equivalent food products, is issued to workers on days of actual engagement in jobs with harmful labour conditions due to the presence of harmful factors in the workplace.
On the basis of these specified norms, the Federal Tax Service of Russia concluded in a review letter that, Article 217(3)(2) of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation provides a basis for the exemption from the imposition of personal income tax on income in the form of the cost of the milk issued to workers on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful labour conditions, in accordance with the Rules and Terms approved by Order No. 45N of the Ministry of Health of Russia of 16.02.2009.
Moscow's Gazstroibank has lost its license from the Central Bank.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to carry out banking operations from the credit institution, Joint Stock Commercial Bank GAZSTROIBANK, which is registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSC JSCB GAZSTROIBANK, pursued a high-risk lending policy related to the investment of funds in low-quality assets.
A reasonable estimate of assumed risks, as requested by the regulatory authority, and a reliable picture of the value of the bank's assets, led to the emergence of grounds for the application of bankruptcy prevention measures at the credit institution.
Furthermore, the credit institution was involved in dubious transit transactions.
A temporary administration has been appointed at the bank for a period of validity up until the appointment of the bankruptcy manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit institution have been suspended in accordance with federal laws.
JSC JSCB GAZSTROIBANK is a member of the deposit insurance system.
It bears reminding that, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ ‘On the insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the Russian Federation’, insurance payouts to bank depositors, including sole traders, covers 100% of the remaining balance, but not more than 1.4 million roubles in total per depositor.
Payouts, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will commence no later than on 26 August 2016.
According to accounting statements, as of 1 August 2016, JSC JSCB GAZSTROIBANK held 335th place in the banking system of the Russian Federation in terms of assets.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIL killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, has reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She was believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tombstone and testament to others, that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making that choice really," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a flight to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told she married an ISIL fighter in Syria - and became a widow within months.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
Treats says nude calendar for 'women, as well as men'
Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s' Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they're setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit pics online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Notices about unscrupulous online stores will be distributed to Muscovites.
In Moscow, a notice is about to be released that will describe how to avoid falling victim to an online store.
Rospotrebnadzor reported this, writes M24.
It is reported that the agency's experts are preparing a notice, which will help citizens to properly choose an online store and to recognise possibly fraudulent schemes.
The intention of this brochure is to cover several sections.
These will include general information and the legal framework, the terms of delivery for goods, and ways to protect one's legal rights.
Recommendations on how to properly lodge a complaint and so forth will be included in the appendix’, Rospotrebnadzor said.
At the moment, the notice is being finalised.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of the Moscow Department of Rospotrebnadzor, and it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute it to Muscovites.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a statement that names the second person suspected of organising subversive activities in Crimea.
The detained individuals are part of a group of Ukrainian and Russian citizens who have participated in the preparation of terrorist attacks.
They include Evgeny Alexandrovich Panov and Andrei Romanovich Zakhtei.
'All of them are giving a confession', the statement said.
Earlier, Evgeny Panov, a resident of Zaporozhsky Region, who was detained on suspicion of organising acts of terrorism in Crimea, admitted his guilt during an interrogation.
The FAS will fine Google 438 million roubles.
Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine against the corporation, Google, in the amount of 438 million roubles, according to the agency's website.
‘The fine against the company, Google, for violation of antimonopoly legislation, amounted to 438 million roubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine in the near future’, stated Alexei Dotsenko, Deputy Head of the FAS.
During the investigation, the FAS established that Google is only supplying manufacturers of smartphones that are sold in Russia with the Google Play app store on the condition that the corporation's other applications will also be installed on the device.
The search engine, which must be placed on the home screen of the smartphone, is listed among these applications.
As such, the corporation is in violation of Article 10(1) of the Federal Law ‘On Protection of Competition’ (abuse of a dominant position).
We are confident that enforcement of the order will enable the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The law “On Protection of Competition” must be followed by all companies whose products are available in the Russian Federation, including transnational corporations’, noted Elena Zaeva, Head of the Department for Regulating Communications and Information Technologies at the FAS of Russia.
The agency suspects 16 Russian stores of price collusion.
The New Book chain was fined for selling the book, ‘50 days until my suicide’.
The New Book chain of stores was fined for selling Stace Kramer's book, ‘50 days until my suicide’, Moscow City News Agency reports.
As reported by Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be seen as 'encouraging or motivating suicidal behaviour in children and adolescents'.
The Ostankino District Court confirmed the violation of specified requirements for the distribution of information products among children and ruled to impose penalty in the form of a fine and confiscation of 49 copies of the printed product, which were seized by the Rospotrebnadzor directorate.
A source from New Book confirmed that the incident concerned Stace Kramer's work.
In March of this year, it was reported that inspections for the presence of the book, ‘50 days until my suicide’, were being conducted at the largest bookstores in Moscow.
An evening in memory of Ernst Neizvestny will be held in Moscow.
An evening in memory of the sculptor, Ernst Neizvestny, will be held in Moscow, TASS reports.
The event will take place on 15 August, at the Central House of Writers.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to Neizvestny, face-to-face, in the United States.
As such, it was decided to organise this evening for those who would like to remember him in his native land’, stated the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
They noted that this is important to the sculptor's widow, Anna Graham, and to his friends throughout the world.
Close friends of Neizvestny have been invited to the evening event, including: the poet, Yevgeny Yevtushenko; the artist, Boris Messerer; President of the Pushkin Museum, Irina Antonova; the director, Mark Rozovsky; as well as Minister of Culture, Vladimir Medinsky; Head of the Department of Culture for Moscow, Alexander Kibovsky; and Deputy Mayor of Moscow, Leonid Pechatnikov.
Earlier, it was reported that Ernst Neizestny's relatives plan to hold a memorial service for the sculptor in New York, presumably before 14 August.
Vinyl destination: who is actually buying records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you rush to litter the comments section with gnarly insults under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen, this statement derives from actual data.
According to YouGov, the much talked-about record resurgence is driven not by a boom in millennials who want to embrace the novelty of a physical item, but by midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a vinyl album are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54, apparently.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
It is not just an act of hoarding by hobbyists, either - it has emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% versus 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was a televised news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street, wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping, cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like: "So, let's take a look."
So, let's take a look.
While the heart of Soho is slowly being drained of its charm and grot - hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases now fill the buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit, in which I stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observation.
Glaswegian Stuart, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I suppose I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snap, I didn't follow him home), line his living room walls.
His reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they originally came out, and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint.
"A lot of the stuff I get is late 60s, early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a bit too young to get," he says.
He agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile.
He has, however, noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records.
From conversations I've had, people have got rid of their collection, normally around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back," he says.
That may explain a boom in vinyl revivalists of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?
It takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types.
According to Wez, some older customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular.
Some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to retreat to the stability of the familiar record sleeve, of items that recall halcyon teenage memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as some kind of comfort," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I have that, and I think a lot of people do.
It's an easy way to occupy your headspace.
"We're like their social workers!" pipes up a co-worker from a stack of records.
An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it.
The poll also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations.
The "trophy" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three midde-aged men) has noticed.
"Someone came in recently and said: "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,"" he says.
That's not a large percentage, but it's definitely happening.
More of the product side, less of the music.
We have people saying: "I don't have a record player."
That's younger people, not older ones, late teens who are just getting into it.
Fopp, which now dedicates almost an entire floor to vinyl, has a far more varied audience when I arrive.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is less at ease than the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synth- and sex-fuelled pop, rather than noodling jazz, is blasting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records on sale.
She is window-shopping, rather than on a spending spree.
She doesn't earn a lot, she says, so collecting records isn't really an option.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to listen to music by a computer or another way, but the beauty of vinyl is ..." she drifts off into a lovestruck sigh.
I don't know how to explain - it's really unique.
My last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants, I observe a group of teenage girls, who cluster around the Polaroid cameras momentarily, before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a Crosley record player.
To the left is a stairwell, a wall of which is stacked with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary and classics, the essential records for any average collection.
Nobody is looking - perhaps because they are merely decoration, some so high up the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is pure "art vinyl."
But, given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is little to complain about.
It is no surprise that a demographic more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest YouGov's results are accurate, in Soho record stores at least, they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record shops and on online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of Berwick Street, flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who has been studying the sharks, says record goes to a female thought to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five metres in length
French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.
They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."
The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.
Microdistrict libraries invite the young residents of Svobodnensky District to attend educational programmes.

The programmes are oriented towards children, so for the most part, they will be play-based.
Today, 10 August, Library Branch No. 2 in Zaliniine Microdistrict invites the public to check out the presentation, ‘My little town’.
On 11 August, Library Branch No. 1 will hold a local history hour, ‘I live in this city; I know this city’.
On the same day, a multimedia lesson will be held at Library Branch No. 2 called, ‘The past fate of the native land’.
While, at Library Branch No. 4 in Surazhevka, there will be a play-based programme called, ‘Film, film, film’.
On Sunday, 14 August, Library Branch No. 3 will hold a play-based programme called, ‘Yes to Physical Education!’, for children from the northern neighbourhood.
Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.
But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team.
It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
It has been some journey for GB.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost just one.
This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.
Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.
It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.
With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing, which was converted.
12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.
A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji.
On seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17-0 to the bad.
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.
The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.
It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.
Which is pretty much how it is.
GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.
Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.
The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle
There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height.
Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, it was touch and go.
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.
If they don't it goes everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It alters your outlook a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough.
That's how it starts off.
Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.
In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams, who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."
It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well.
It's been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.
Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much in the moment.
Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything amazing.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.
The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.
For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," she said.
The government has extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctioned goods
The government has extended the deadline for the destruction of food products prohibited from entering Russia until the end of 2017.
The corresponding decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official internet portal for legal information.
The embargo against countries that have imposed anti-Russian sanctions over the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban was repeatedly extended, and is now valid until 31 December 2017.
In Russia, it is prohibited to import certain agricultural products, raw materials, and food from the United States, EU countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.
In particular, the ban covers meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits, and dairy products.
The disposal of food products imported into the country in contravention of the embargo has been underway in Russia since August 2015.
Just in the first quarter of 2016, approximately 100 t of prohibited goods have been withdrawn from sale.
On the hunt for ‘prohibited goods’
Rain and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
A weather front that will bring precipitation and lower the air temperature will pass through the capital region.
During the day, the air will warm to 25 degrees Celsius.
Then, overnight into Saturday, there will be periods of rain in some areas of Moscow, with possible thunderstorms and wind gusts of up to 15 m/s.
During the day, rain with thunderstorms and wind gusts of up to 12-17 m/s are expected.
Rain with thunderstorms is also forecast for Oryol, Kursk, and Voronezh Regions, Dni.ru reports.
Precipitation is unlikely for the upcoming workweek.
A WTO panel of arbitrators has found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators, and palm oil contravene the rules of the organisation.
The import rate is in excess of commitments assumed by Russia upon accession to the WTO.
'This is the first time that the WTO has decided against Russia', says a statement on the official website of the organisation.
However, the arbitrators pointed out in their conclusion that the EU has not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures ‘were systematic' or 'were overarching in nature'.
Russia, in turn, has promised to adjust import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is noted in a statement from the Russian Ministry of Economic Development and Trade.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to complain to the World Trade Organisation about Russia's actions, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in a complaint from the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the behaviour of the United States during the resolution of disputes through the WTO undermines the organisation's accepted principles of discussion.
Similar statements were made by Brazil, Japan, the EU, and other WTO members, because of the Americans' refusal to approve South Korean judge, Seung Wha Chang, for a second term.
As a consequence, Russia will not make an appeal to the WTO regarding the issue of Western sanctions introduced against Russia.
The WTO is an international organisation, founded in January 1995, for the liberalisation of international trade.
Currently, it consists of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The head of the Executive Office of the President has been replaced
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed Sergei Ivanov's former deputy, Anton Vaino, as head of his administration.
Vladimir Putin carried out the reshuffling of the Executive Office of the President and expressed hope that the new head of his administration would facilitate the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vaino said at the meeting that he considers the anti-corruption measures, which Ivanov launched as head of the Presidential Executive Office, to be important, and he promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation surrounding Sergei Ivanov's resignation from the post of head of the administration to be transparent and understandable, and that the reshuffle will not fundamentally change anything in the work of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the outgoing head had been working in the presidential administration for a significant period of time and had effectively organised the work of the Presidential Executive Office.
Aton Vaino, Deputy Head of the Presidential Executive Office, a person who perfectly understands the specifics of this job, has taken his place.
Poland suggests that it will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish Oil and Gas Company, PGNIG, has not ruled out the possibility that, in a few years, the supply of gas from Russia could become unappealing to it, as a result of a reorientation towards fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was announced by Bohuslav Marzec, Vice President of Finance for the Polish company.
TASS quotes him as saying this.
‘It may just happen that we will no longer buy any gas (from Gazprom); we are currently diversifying our supply.
Within the next four years, the main directions of supply for us will be from the East, raw materials from LNG terminals, and Norway’, said Marzec.
Currently, Gazprom occupies the dominant position in gas shipments to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that, in the first half of 2016, the Russian supplier delivered nearly 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas to it, which is 30% higher than in 2015.
The Russian gas giant's share in PGNIG procurements grew to 49.8%, compared to 40% a year earlier.
Recall that, on 22 July, Poland's antimonopoly agency denied the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
That being said, a month earlier, Poland made a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic metres of gas through Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by Alexander Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Board for the holding.
An auction for the allocation of Nord Stream 2 capacities will be held in 2017, and it is planned that an auction for its installation will take place in the autumn of 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom does not plan, as of yet, to take any actions in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to withdraw from long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, stated Alexander Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Board for the company.
He recalled that, in the first quarter of this year, the Poles just increased their procurements of gas from the Russian Federation by 42%.
The deputy chairman of Gazprom added that the mere fact that Poland's PGNIG filed a complaint with the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not necessarily mean that negotiations have broken down.
Previously, the Polish company appealed to the court in order to reduce the purchase price for Russian gas.
It bears reminding that the representative of the Polish government for issues of gas and energy infrastructure, Piotr Naimski, said that Polish authorities have decided not to extend the gas supply contract with Gazprom.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the representative of the Polish government for issues of gas and energy infrastructure, Piotr Naimski, stated that, in six years time, his country could opt out of deliveries of the ‘blue fuel’ from the East.
According to him, Warsaw is planning to build the Baltic Pipe, a new LNG supply terminal, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 calls for the construction of two lines of off-shore pipelines running from Russia to Germany under the Baltic sea, with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year.
The Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) of the OSCE has increased the number of observers near the border of Ukraine with Crimea.
This was announced by Principal Deputy Chief of the SMM in Ukraine, Alexander Hug.
'I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area', he said in answer to a corresponding question from journalists, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, and there haven't been any reported incidents affecting security.
Observers were monitoring what was happening at three checkpoints on the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a Yak-42 passenger plane, which landed at Ufa airport, skidded 400 m off the runway, and fell on its left wing, has appeared online.
The video recording was posted by 360 TV.
The incident occurred at 4:30 a.m. Moscow time.
The KrasAvia airline flight was en route from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, and there were no injuries.
The aircraft itself was transported to the apron.
Ufa airport is operating as per usual.
The Volga District Transport Investigation Department of the Investigative Committee of Russia has begun the process of determining the reason for the liner's rough landing.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
A UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny using chlorine gas, however, UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, considers the fact of what happened to be indisputable.
Similar allegations were made just before the third round of inter-Syrian talks that should begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have opened an investigation into reports that chemical weapons were used in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about a terrorist attack using toxic gas, presumably chlorine gas, appeared on 2 August.
At that time, the opposition said that aircraft dropped bombs with a poisonous substance in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down the previous day, but Moscow deemed these accusations to be utterly false.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence blamed the opposition group, Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki, for the incident.
Soon thereafter, it came to light that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by one of the victims speaking to BBC.
‘A few minutes later, I could smell the gas, my eyes started to burn, and it became difficult to breathe’, the publication quotes the witness as saying.
At least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalised as a result of the attack.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the action will be regarded as a war crime.
UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters: ‘there is a lot of evidence that this actually did take place’.
The prohibition of the use of chlorine gas for military purposes is spelled out in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
In spite of the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny using toxic gases, in 2015, human rights activists recorded 35 cases of the Syrian army using chlorine gas against the ‘moderate opposition’.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that its districts are being bombarded on a daily basis, and the terrorists are preventing the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN is waiting for Russia to establish a ‘humanitarian pause’ in military operations.
The current regime of a daily, three-hour halt to hostilities, in the opinion of the organisation, is ‘insufficient to help the nearly 2 million civilians who are caught in the trap’.
Staffan de Mistura's advisor for humanitarian affairs, Jan Egeland, stated that, in order to deliver aid into the city and evacuate the sick and wounded, a 48-hour cease-fire every week would be required.
‘We have to send bulk cargo in convoys of trucks into an area where the roads are virtually destroyed and those that remain are mined’, reported Mr Egeland. But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit down with us at the negotiating table’.
In Geneva, consultations between representatives of the United States and Russia, regarding the establishment of a ‘humanitarian pause’, continue.
How Russia opened ‘humanitarian windows’ in Aleppo.
On 11 August, amidst the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia announced the introduction of a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will take place daily starting on Thursday.
The creation of ‘humanitarian windows’ is intended to enable the delivery of medicine, food, and basic necessities into the city.
The decision by the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation was made in the face of growing international pressure on Moscow with requests to scale back the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
Four people were killed as a result of a series of explosions at resorts in Thailand.
All at once, several explosions rocked southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed and 19 were injured as a result of the attack.
The epicentre of the explosions occurred in the town of Hua Hin.
Ten foreigners, citizens from four states, were among the victims; there were no Russian citizens among them.
None of the terrorist groups have taken responsibility for the incident yet, but the Ministry of the Interior was quick to declare that the Islamists had not been involved in it.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of organising the explosions.
According to preliminary information from the local police, the scale and distinctive features of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military running the country.
The attacks happened in popular tourist areas such as Patong Beach in Phuket, and in the cities of Hua Hin, Trang, and Surat Thani.
After the military junta took over control of the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (in 2012) to 2.8% (in 2015), but tourism remained one of the few sectors that was showing growth.
14 million people have already visited the country in 2016, 1.5 million more than the figure for 2015.
The first individuals suspected of preparing and organising the attacks have already been detained, reported Police Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen.
It's too early to talk about motives, he added, but the Ministry of the Interior is 'confident that they are not connected to international extremist groups'.
It's too early to draw conclusions, said Mr Patanacharoen.
However, we do know that these incidents are not directly linked to any form of terrorism; in fact, they are acts of local sabotage, and we are trying to establish the identity of those who were behind them.
The explosions took place on the birthday of Thailand's Queen Sirikit.
The Thai junta considers protecting the monarchy one of its main priorities, so the incident was most likely directed against it.
According to statements by Police General Sithichai Srisopacharoenrath, the bombs were remotely detonated within a half hour of each other.
They were hidden within the trees on busy streets, which were filled with tourists having lunch in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four killed was a young Thai woman selling street food.
The identities of the remaining victims are still unknown, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, they include four citizens of Germany, three Dutch nationals, two citizens of Italy, and one citizen of Austria.
There were no Russian citizens among the victims of the explosions, the press service of the Russian Federal Tourism Agency reported.
Local experts have also connected the explosions with the referendum that took place on 7 August, in which 61.4% of the country's population supported the new draft constitution.
It was prepared by the constitution drafting committee appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide if they support a system in which the upper house of the parliament is entirely appointed by the military and has a significant role in electing the Prime Minister of the country.
The new system was adopted and it will be tested for the first time during the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall that, on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the commander of the country's army, Prayuth Chan-ocha.
According to him, the army was prompted to take this step by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, imposed a curfew and censorship, dispersed protesters, and dismissed the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok ended up in a state of emergency
In January 2014, the government of Thailand, led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, announced the imposition of a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces surrounding the capital.
The special security arrangement lasted for 60 days.
How two explosions rocked Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the heart of Bangkok, two explosions occurred at the Victory Monument, which was one of the main sites of the protest, and as a consequence, 28 people were injured and five of them were in critical condition.
The explosions were carried out by unidentified individuals on motorcycles.
The authorities increased security measures in the capital and brought in military forces to protect demonstrators.
The development of terms has begun in Sukhoi Log.
Kommersant has learned that the government has been asked to approve a proposal for the terms of an auction for the gold deposit, Sukhoi Log, while preserving two key restrictions.
It is proposed to bar from the auction companies that are 25% or more foreign-owned and those bidders whose capital will not consist of at least 25% state participation.
Industry insiders aren't expecting the government to rewrite the terms, noting that there are already many players that won't risk taking on the complex and expensive project.
They could announce the auction in August and hold it in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has submitted to the government a draft of the regulation and auction terms for the world's largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia, Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, with 130 million ounces in reserves and resources), said two of Kommersant's sources who are familiar with the situation.
The draft was submitted on Wednesday evening, one of them elaborated.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment confirmed to Kommersant that the draft was submitted to the government.
The representative in charge of subsoil use, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin, told Kommersant that the official's administrative office has not yet received the draft.
‘The auction could be announced as early as August, immediately after a government order is issued, and given the timeframe for the submission of applications from potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender could take place as early as October’, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment said.
According to Kommersant, two key requirements for potential participants were preserved in the wording of the version of the draft that was submitted for approval to the ministries and the Federal Executive Authority in July (Kommersant has a copy).
The first is that bidders must have a minimum of 25% state participation in their capital.
The second is that companies under the control of foreign investors are denied access to the auction, based on an understanding of Federal Law No.57 on investments in strategic entities.
According to the two articles of the federal law mentioned in the draft, which Kommersant already wrote about on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (a 25% share and higher) are not tax residents of Russia or who have dual citizenship need not be permitted access to the auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, given that Sukhoi Log is classified as a federal-status mineral resource (reserves of over 50 tonnes of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment confirmed that the draft 'contains restrictions on the participation of foreign companies’, but declined to comment on the details in advance of the government order.
The requirement of state participation in the capital of auction participants was proposed by Irkutsk Region, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment told Kommersant in December 2015, which was later confirmed by the region's governor, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it had been sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment by his predecessor, Sergei Eroschenko, ‘who had an agreement on investment projects with Rostec’.
Kommersant's sources did not specify who lobbied for the restriction on the participation of foreigners.
‘But this is in the spirit of the times: to not hand over control of the largest gold deposits in Russia amidst Western sanctions’, argues a Kommersant source familiar with the auction’s preparations.
On 1 August, Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, Sergei Donskoy, said that foreigners ‘can enter into a consortium’, if bidders invite them to participate ‘in the capacity of a financial structure and as technology partners’.
Kommersant's sources consider it highly unlikely the government will adjust the terms.
The industry front-runner for Sukhoi Log is believed to be a consortium of the largest gold mining company in the Russian Federation, PJSC Polyus (which is controlled by Suleiman Kerimov's son, Said), and Rostec.
As Kommersant wrote, in July, the partners established a joint venture, CL Gold, which gives Polyus 51% of the shares, and the structure, Rostec RT-Global Resources, 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, while Polyus told Kommersant that ‘definitely, they are interested in the asset’ and possess all the necessary expertise and resources for its development.
‘But a final decision on the feasibility and form of our participation will be made after the announcement of terms’, Polyus added.
ALROSA might participate in the auction, but the decision is up to the government of the Russian Federation, said Kommersant's sources.
Russia's GV Gold and Canada's Kinross Gold, which is developing assets in Chukotka Region, have also announced the possibility of participating in the development of Sukhoi Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to Kommersant, are not interested in the asset.
Sergei Kashuba, Chairman of the Russian Union of Gold Producers, told Kommersant in December 2015, that investments in Sukhoi Log were valued at between $2.5 and 4 billion.
The majority of potential bidders are deterred not only by the investment amount, but also by the complexity of the project: extensive in-mine exploration of reserves and methods for working with complex ores are required, Kommersant's sources in the industry explain.
The largest M&A deal in the pension market has gotten underway: KIT Finance Pension Administrator has launched the process of combining four Non-State Pension Funds (NPF) under its control.
As a result, an NPF with savings of around 373 billion roubles will be created on the basis of Gazfond Pension Savings.
The launch of the merger of the four pension funds – KIT Finance, Promagrofond, Nasledie, and Gazfond Pension Savings – was reported yesterday by the 100% owner of the funds, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, LLC.
‘The reorganisation is being carried out in coordination with the Central Bank, and in compliance with the requirement that there be no deterioration in the terms of existing contracts’, says a company statement.
The merger is being carried out on the basis of Gazfond Pension Savings.
As noted by the CEO of this NPF, Oleg Byaloshitsky, the merging of the funds makes it possible to solve several problems: expand geographical presence, pool resources for development, reduce costs, replicate the best practices of each of the funds, and improve corporate management.
According to him, the approximate completion date for the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger, NPF Gazfond Pension Savings will become the largest player in the compulsory pension insurance market.
As of 31 March, the volume of pension savings of the merging funds exceeded 373 billion roubles.
Based on the financials on the website of the funds, Anatoly Gavrilenko (who owns 65% through a controlled LLC) and NPF Gazfond (35%) are the current beneficiaries of their owner, KIT Finance Pension Administrator.
However, the merger of this group was launched much later than its competitors.
For example, NPF Future, under the control of O1 Group, absorbed Stalfond back at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this combined NPF is absorbing the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
‘Merging into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary for solving structural problems’, notes the CEO of NPF Future, Nikolay Sidorov.
The Safmar pension group has been engaged in active efforts aimed at consolidating funds since April: the European, Education and Science, and Regionfond NPFs should join the ranks of NPF Safmar by the end of this year.
In 2017, NPF Doverie will join them.
‘Merging the funds will have the effect of improving risk control, operational processes, and costs’, the Safmar pension group noted.
The pause in merging funds that KIT Finance Pension Administrator took could have been caused by several factors, experts say.
Until recently, NPFs could not redeem more than 40% of the volume of an issue of infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively involved.
After amendments were made to the Central Bank resolution in March of this year, there are no longer any such restrictions for a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, an entire issue can be redeemed by one big player’, says Yury Nogin, Director of the Financial Institutions Ratings Group at ACRA.
Several heads of the top-15 NPFs by assets named the division of spheres of influence, and, as a result, the appointment of staff in a single fund, which had to be agreed to by the owners of the group, as yet another possible reason for the pause.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko could not be reached for comment.
NPF Gazfond also did not respond to Kommersant's request.
Although the consolidation of funds is a time-consuming and expensive affair, this decision will be justified in the long run.
Sergei Kolesnov, CEO of the consulting firm, Pension Partner, notes that Gazfond Pension Savings has fewer outflows, so the accession will help to stabilise the base of the group's other funds.
Moreover, the successful experience of NPFs, KIT Finance and Promagrofond, in generating retail sales of compulsory pension insurance and in using more modern software, will be in demand.
The Central Bank's requirements for the activities and personnel of NPFs are constantly growing, so it is impractical to duplicate the infrastructure of the four funds given their unified investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director of Corporate Ratings at Expert RA.
‘The effect of cutting out duplicate functions will definitely cover the potential costs of the merger’, notes Mr Mitrofanov.
Sergei Okolesnov estimates the cost of merging the four funds at between 30-50 million roubles.
‘The cost of maintaining four funds of these sizes amounts to about 400 million roubles a year, so, in the medium term, the consolidation will actually cut the budget by half’, Mr Okolesnov assured.
The kindest Disney film, ‘Pete's Dragon’, has been released in Russia.
The beautiful views of New Zealand, the adorable dragon, the sentimental story, and the country music songs are enough to make one believe in good old-fashioned magic once again, says ELENA KRAVTSUN.
The dragon finds the frightened boy, becoming both a gentle caregiver and loyal friend to the young human.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honour of a puppy from a book of fairy tales, plays tag with him, and falls asleep in his embrace.
Six years later, with a beard and in a loincloth, he is indistinguishable from that other clever forest rascal, Mowgli.
It is in this state that he is found by the redheaded huntress, Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while a team led by Gavin (Karl Urban), the brother of her husband, is aggressively clearing the forest.
Now, she is faced not only with believing that the dragon exists, but also with helping to save him.
Pete goes through a crash course in ‘being human’, surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, live according to a moral code, and smile more brightly than in any advertising.
None of the characters look or act too horribly for the audience to really start to hate or fear them.
Even Gavin, who unleashes a hunt for the unusual inhabitant of the woods under his control, is far from an incorrigible villain.
The huge fluffy dragon also turned out to be anything but frightening, with the sweet muzzle of a bulldog, the wingspan of an airplane, and the power of invisibility.
The dragon amusingly grunts, purrs, and even snorts, but, thankfully, does not speak; although, the whole time, you want to be petting him, and it is in this sense that he has an obvious advantage over all the other known cinematic dragons.
The visual representation of Elliot and his mannerisms create such a high degree of emotional involvement that, in the most intense moments, it's not only the young members of the audience who start desperately bawling their eyes out, but also the adults.
The young Oakes Fegley is also surprisingly good in the role of Pete: torn between his potential family and a true friend.
While Robert Redford masterfully plays the iconic grandfather, whom literally every child would be glad to have.
How did Director David Lowery manage to shoot a fantastically lovable remake of the forgotten Disney film, ‘Pete's Dragon’ (1977), – which was mediocre from start to finish and only remembered for combining animation and live-action film – and turn it into this summer's most heartwarming film?
Nothing short of a miracle would have helped.
Lowry, in fact, only took two things from the original for his film: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
The musical numbers and most of the odd jokes were thrown overboard.
Features drawn from ‘Bambi’, ‘E.T.’, and many other cherished children's films can be seen in this kind-hearted tale.
Disney Studios continues to successfully expand their gallery of high-quality 21st century remakes.
Of course, ‘Pete's Dragon’ is not as stunningly beautiful as ‘The Jungle Book’, and there is no cunning villain, such as Cate Blanchett turned out to be in the role of the stepmother in the new ‘Cinderella’.
But this simple-hearted film, in keeping with the best traditions of Disney, is no less successful in helping one to believe in miracles and goodness.
In fact, Director Lowry will get the keys to Disney's magic castle once again for an artistic film adaptation of the story of ‘Peter Pan’.
The tandem of David Lowery and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks, tried and tested during ‘Pete's Dragon’, has entered into an ambitious new project about the boy who never grew up from James Barrie's fairy tale by the same name.
A new charge will be brought against RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov
Lawyers for the RBC journalist, Alexander Sokolov, accused of organising an extremist organisation, reported that the prosecutor's office found mistakes in the case against their client.
We only learned that the prosecutor's office had made such a recommendation from investigators yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in a court hearing regarding restrictions on familiarisation with the materials of the criminal case, but the hearing never actually took place, and then the investigators informed us of the recommendation issued by the prosecutor's office’, RBC quotes lawyer, Olga Dinze, as saying.
She related that the prosecutor's office pointed out to the investigators the discrepancy between the classification of the case and the materials collected.
Now, investigators will have to bridge the gaps in the body of evidence and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either the case will fall under a different section of the Criminal Code (CC), or it will stay the same, but with different arguments and new evidence, Ms Dinze clarifies.
As Kommersant reported, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded the RBC journalist from a charge worded as ‘undermining the stability of political environment’ and ‘overthrowing the government by illegal means’.
Kommersant-Boscosport correspondent, ALEXANDER ZILBERT, lived the life of an Olympic athlete in the Olympic Village, inspected Team Russia House, had lunch at the on-site cafeteria, and, after all of this, even passed a WADA test.
It seems that life here never stops for a second.
Even at night.
The last events sometimes end after midnight, after which the athletes still need about one and a half to two hours to return to the Olympic Village.
Furthermore, people are constantly checking-in and checking-out of the village, as some athletes leave Brazil after finishing their competitions, while others, on the contrary, have only just arrived here.
Well, it's only 7:30 a.m. and all of the heads of the Olympic delegations are crammed into one of the temporary tents.
We usually discuss certain mundane operational issues at these meetings, recounts Igor Kazikov, Head of the Sports Delegation of the Russian Olympic Team. In spite of the fact that the building where our people have been housed is considered to be a showpiece – it was one of the first to be commissioned and was shown to all the inspectors – even here, certain deficiencies are constantly being found.
One day there's a problem with the hot water, and the next day it's, excuse me, the toilets.
We struggled with issues of cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one was even showing up to clean.
Then, the cleaners started to show up, but only to spray some kind of substance on the floor, and that was all.
Their floors, can't you see, are somehow innovative.
Supposedly you can't wash them like a normal person.
Sure, we know these kinds of floors: ordinary laminate flooring!
In sum, we successfully managed to switch cleaning companies and now everything seems to be OK with this.
The Olympic Village is like Yuzhnoe Butovo, a residential district fenced in by mountains on one side and on the other sides, there is an impressive ditch filled here and there with water.
Well, for security, there is also a two-metre iron fence around the whole perimeter, along which guards, armed with automatic weapons, stroll.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3,604 apartments, located inside 31 buildings.
A massive Russian flag hangs on one of these 18-storey buildings: this building has been totally handed-over for use by our team.
Taking a glance at the small foyer by the entrance, you can immediately identify the problems that are apparently the most pressing for our home team.
Two notices are hanging at the front desk: a printed one, ‘Please, do not throw paper in the toilet!’, and a hand-written one, ‘I will accept pins as gifts’.
The front desk itself is buried under pamphlets.
Their cheerful colours contrast with the titles of the brochures: ‘A guide to infectious diseases for travellers to Rio de Janeiro’; ‘First aid for drowning, choking on a foreign object, loss of consciousness - the steps of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation’; and ‘First aid for burns, heat stroke, fractures, and bleeding’.
The inside text is, generally speaking, reassuring.
For example, this one: ‘the infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent recovery.
However, not everyone can expect a favourable outcome.
Of course, Team Russia has a medical centre at its disposal, which is always ready to provide residents of the house with professional assistance, including relaxation and sports massage.
Across from the medical centre is our delegation's headquarters.
Next to the door, there is an inspirational poster: ‘In spite of everything, we shall prevail!’.
And, of course, there is poetry:
All the arguments are absolute nonsense!
They are only believed by those who are afraid.
The fewer of us there are, the sweeter the taste of victory: Russia will not back down and will not be broken!
And to further raise one's spirits, there hangs an announcement: ‘Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of his Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, Archpriest Andrei Vladimirovich Alexeev will perform spiritual care for the athletes of the Russian Olympic Team.
Prayer service and other religious rites can be ordered by phone...
In fact, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious Ceremonies for representatives of all faiths within the village.
While Russians, it turns out, are given special treatment: they have their own chapel.
In light of congestion on the elevator between the ninth and the fourth floors, I decided to go down the stairs that are recommended for use during a fire.
And, in the darkness, I stumbled over bodies laying down on them.
By all accounts, it was the staff from the new cleaning company sleeping.
On the ready, I dare say, at any moment to rush to wash the innovative floors, they had decided to arrange a naptime for themselves directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I had a meeting with a long-time acquaintance, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach for our trampolinists, who led them to Olympic gold, 16 years ago already, in Sydney.
He and his pupil, European champion, Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
By and large, there is nothing to complain about, the honoured coach of Russia shares his impressions. We live two to a room, the beds, of course, are almost right up against each other, but it's not critical.
There is one bathroom for four people, but at least it's spacious.
Of course, the wardrobe is laughable; it's made of cloth and doesn't inspire a lot of confidence, but things can be put in it.
‘No, well, can you imagine it? They've run out of tea!’, tennis player, Svetlana Kuznetsova, who met me in the main dining room, says while throwing her hands up in dismay.
It's called the main dining room if for no other reason than the fact that it provides 2,7 thousand square meters of space and is ready to accommodate 5 thousand visitors at one time.
Here, they produce 60 thousand servings a day absolutely free of charge.
The menu options include: ‘The Best of Brazil’, ‘Global Cuisine’, ‘Asian Dishes’, and ‘Pizza and Pasta’.
The last option, as I noticed, is very popular with our volleyball players.
Having said that, I couldn't find soup, for example, in any one of the areas of the giant restaurant.
Who cares about soup?, Kuznetsova says in astonishment, There's no tea!
It's a good thing I brought some Chinese tea to brew with me.
And a teapot.
But, in general, just so you understand, the food at the tennis courts is even worse.
Here, there is at least something to choose, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose the steamed cod and meatballs in tomato sauce.
A sign is situated beside each dish with its name in three languages – English, French, and Portuguese – and it also shows the nutritional value of the item and the presence of allergens.
And well, I must confess, it was entirely edible.
I don't even understand why there is always such a queue at the local McDonald's.
The well-fed, relaxed, and, in a manner of speaking, ‘food drunk’ athletes are awaited at the restaurant exit by our best friends: representatives from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They cleverly entice with a quiz, the winner of which will receive a tee-shirt.
They're luring them in, you could say!
To get a gift, you have to correctly answer at least eight out of ten questions.
A girl from WADA ambushed me with ‘There are questions in Russian!’.
But she didn't ambush the right person.
That is to say, I harnessed my patriotic impulse, of course.
The situation already took a turn for the worse by the second question: ‘If I received a notification to report to doping control, should I report immediately to the doping control centre?’
I settled on option B: ‘No, I have one hour’.
I was caught, how to say, off guard.
I forgot that there's no sense in waiting for a break from WADA.
Essentially, you need to report immediately.
Well, by the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation had become entirely critical.
For some reason, I thought that if I was having a hard time sticking to a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and, by the way, it is hard for me!), I could use dietary supplements to get ‘extra nutrients to enhance my performance’.
But alas, they won't allow it!
To be more precise, the answer is formulated in such a way that they don't outright forbid it, but rather, in a few sentences, strongly advise against it.
That WADA doesn't play fair!
‘So, how's it going, Russia?’, the presenter of the quiz mockingly questions.
There was nowhere to hide: behind me were Efimova, Isinbayeva, and the rest of our depleted team.
So I buckled down and, using my last ounce of strength, won that pitiful tee-shirt.
As the saying goes, let them see what we're made of!
In a triumphant mood, I wandered into the nearby fitness centre.
I got caught up with counting the fitness machines.
I lost track at 250.
I noted with surprise that there was not a single Russian athlete to be found among this mass of treadmills.
But maybe that's the way it should be?
Let those who don't know how to play be the ones who train!
However, one of our boys was sitting at the medical clinic located nearby.
In line to see the optometrist.
Don't worry; he's not a shooter.
At the clinic, and for that matter, as with everywhere else you look throughout the village, hangs a device for distributing condoms.
It is inscribed with an inspiring appeal: ‘Celebrate with a condom!’
Then, you just have to turn a piece of metal resembling the knob of a door lock, and a condom, made of natural latex from the Amazon, readily falls from the device.
I took one for myself, as a memento.
The athletes won't miss it; they brought in 450 thousand of these for them.
In fact, the Olympic Village has a whole recreation centre for celebratory and leisurely pursuits.
Beside it, for good measure, there is an informative plaque, reminding that the International Olympic Committee, in various ways, is spending $3.25 million on the athletes per day.
The centre is inundated with video games, billiards, ping-pong tables, foosball and air hockey tables, and some odd equipment that looks like video training simulators.
‘What is that?’, I ask a comrade in a Ukrainian team uniform, who is actively using the strange toy.
Of course, he could have just said that he didn't want to talk to someone in a Team Russia uniform, and that would have been that.
Here, incidentally, by some sort of strange set of circumstances, my eyes are sore from all these boys in yellow and blue.
A team that never stops playing around, it turns out.
It takes no less than three hours to walk around the whole village, exploring every nook and cranny.
But, if you walk and don't get a ride in the electric cars, you will discover Team Canada House with a moose at the entrance and a pavilion with a restorative bath, and a ticket office, and a laundromat, and a dry cleaners, and a hair salon, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday goods, and a post office with unique stamps (only you won't be able to wait out the queue of Chinese stamp collectors anyways), and a bank, and a lost and found, and a photo booth.
And in the late evening you, exhausted, will sit down beside an olive tree, decorated with multicoloured ribbons in memory of the athletes' dearly departed friends and relatives.
And you, to the accompaniment of a device randomly spraying a liquid to kill insects, will think about eternity.
That is to say, about the Olympic movement.
Which, in this village, doesn't stop even for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world watched with bated breath as the Australians came close to trouncing the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know that I was the first to receive the news that Inna Deriglazova had won gold in foil fencing at the XXXI Olympic Games.
I may even be the only Muscovite who saw how it unfolded, except, of course, for those who were watching the competition that night in Carioca.
Only a true fan could understand.
Just imagine: it's the dead of the night in Moscow.
The neighbours downstairs, as per usual, wake up by 1 a.m. and start amicably, but very loudly, shouting at each other.
And threateningly moving the furniture.
In the kitchen, the faucet is leaking: there hasn't been time to drive to the market and buy a new one like the plumber requested.
The TV schedule makes no sense, so I just kept an eye on the channels, Match, First, and, just in case, Russia, although that's almost pointless.
Russia channel is the birthplace of reruns: all the sports on there are prerecorded for some reason.
TV series are broadcast live on there.
I, of course, was counting on Match: the whole evening the young man on the news broadcasts had been shouting first about the great semi-final between Deriglazova and Shanaeva, and then about the impending battle for the gold.
It would have made sense to show it.
But instead of this, it was basketball between the USA and Australia.
By the way, I can't say anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were an equal match, and, as a matter of fact, they won the first half.
They put the Americans, deluded by grandeur, in their place.
They still lost in the end, but, like they're now saying, the Olympic basketball tournament will never be the same again.
That's all well and good, but the bout with Di Francisca is drawing near and nothing is changing on the screen.
I start flipping through the channels in a slight panic.
It feels like they are playing it for the second time in a row.
Fine, we'll dig deeper and check the cable channels.
There is no fencing on any of the specialty Match channels.
But, I have a feeling that the bout is just about to start.
I'm not interested in settling for the text and twitter broadcasts of some sports websites.
The spastic channel surfing produces an unexpected but brilliant result.
It turns out that the First Channel website broadcasts the technical videostream of all events in real time.
I click on fencing and get the battle for the gold.
Deriglazova mounts a terrific counterattack, moves ahead in points, and, quite obviously, starts to run out the clock.
The Italian claws back almost all of the lead.
Our girl is one point ahead with just a little more than two seconds to go.
Di Francisca lunges at Deriglazova and the latter retreats; time is running out and the Italian makes a play.
Victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic messenger on my phone notifies me of the fourth gold medal.
As it turns out, I am the first to see it with my own eyes.
My crazy, loyal, involved eyes.
The Muslim Religious Board (MRB) of Tatarstan renounces the use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, a plenum of the MRB ordered their imams to lead Friday sermons in Tatar only, to force young Tatars ‘to learn their native language’.
The administrative body states that this ‘in no way infringes’ on the rights of Muslims of other ethnicities.
Several of the mosques in Kazan have complained that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60% of worshippers, such as foreign students, migrants, and even Tatars themselves.
The imams fear that their sermons in Tatar ‘won't reach the entire audience’.
Yesterday, a plenum of the MRB of Tatarstan unanimously adopted a decision to hold Friday sermons in the Republic's mosques in the Tatar language only.
As stated by the Mufti of Tatarstan, Kamil Samigullin, this should become an incentive to young Tatars ‘to learn their native language’.
‘For those who will say that it is “difficult”, we intend to organise absolutely free Tatar language lessons at each of the large mosques’, Mr Samigullin promised.
He added that ‘the decision has already come into force’, and, today, sermons in all mosques ‘should already be in the Tatar language’.
He reminded that the MRB of Tatarstan publishes the journal, ‘Shura’, with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
An imam, who does not speak Tatar well enough, ‘can use them to thoroughly prepare’.
The MRB of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand congregations throughout all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to the mufti, in the regions, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
On the other hand, a number of mosques in Kazan previously had been predominantly using the Russian language.
In particular, as indicated by the mufti, this was the practice at Burnaevskaya Mosque, Zakabannaya Mosque, and at ‘Eniler’.
However, Mr Mukhametshin emphasised that the leadership has made it an objective that all students are proficient in both official languages of the Republic, regardless of ethnicity.
‘This has absolutely nothing to do with infringing on the rights of non-Tatar Muslims’, emphasised Mr Mukhametshin, explaining that the sermon itself ‘is not a mandatory main part of namaz’.
In fact, the namaz itself will still be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons at mosques will still be available in the Russian language.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin told Kommersant that there was never a serious threat of the Tatar language vanishing from mosques.
Except for Russian and Tatar, no other languages, according to him, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are used in sermons in the Republic.
The decision by the MRB was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT).
Chairman of the Executive Committee of the WCT, Rinat Zakirov, told Kommersant: ‘the mosque is an important part of our national life’.
It would be a shame if the Tatar language were to disappear from this sphere.
He noted that conducting sermons in the Tatar language only, ‘is the will of the imams themselves’, but that the Executive Committee of the WCT ‘considers this to be the right decision’.
The imams interviewed by Kommersant who were conducting sermons in Russian, are ready to follow the decision by MRB, however, they believe that the congregation will have difficulty understanding the clerics.
Both Tatars and Russians attend mosque.
Many don't understand the language.
Of course, it's going to be a bit difficult for them.
‘We're going to have to change our ways’, says the Imam of Burnaevskaya Mosque, Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, even many Tatars have a closer affinity to sermons in the Russian language, since ‘Russian is what is in schools and in child care facilities, on the radio, and everywhere, from the very beginning’.
However, he is under the impression that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in the Russian language, which are held on other days.
We have faith in Allah.
Allah will show us the way out of this situation’, he concluded.
But we have around 60% that don't know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
‘That is why we switched to the Russian language four years ago’, the imam says.
He believes that sermons in the Tatar language will ‘reach a more limited group and will not reach the whole audience’.
But we will abide by the decision of the plenum.
Simply, the results of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
‘For example, it will only be easier for me, because Tatar is my native language’, concluded Gabdulla Galiullin.
The former director of the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) has been taken to court
The Moscow Prosecutor's Office has approved an indictment in a criminal case, investigated by the Main Investigations Directorate of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, concerning the embezzlement of budgetary funds allocated for use by the FSIN of Russia.
The former head of the prison service, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy, will appear before the court, having inflicted damages to the FSIN in an amount of more than 2.7 billion roubles.
The capital’s prosecutor's office referred the criminal case against the former director of the FSIN of Russia, Alexander Reimer, his former deputy, Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the director of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise (FSUE), Centre for Information Technology and Communications of the Federal Penitentiary Service (TSITOS), Victor Opredelenov, to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court.
Depending on their role and degree of participation in the crimes, they are accused by the Main Investigations Directorate of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for Moscow under Article 285(3) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers entailing grave consequences), and Article 159(4) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using one's official position, in an organised group, on an especially large scale).
Furthermore, Krivolapov is charged under Article 222(1) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, between 2010 and 2012, the indicated persons fraudulently stole budgetary funds from the state treasury that were allocated to the FSIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for controlled individuals, otherwise known as electronic ankle bracelets.
To embezzle the budgetary funds, the members of the group developed a scheme whereby FSUE TSITOS, an enterprise controlled by them and with whom relevant government contracts were signed, handled the technical means of control and surveillance, including ‘electronic bracelets’, and charged prices that were inflated several times over.
In spite of the fact that FSUE TSITOS had no production equipment, buildings, or structures to house the production facilities necessary to create a complete production cycle for ‘electronic bracelets’, five contracts worth more than 3.3 billion roubles were signed between it and the FSIN of Russia.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles ended up in the accounts of the Samara branch of the FSUE, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
As suggested by the investigation, more than 140 million roubles of the cashed money was personally received by Mr Reimer in his official office from one of the accomplices, whose criminal case was severed.
Ammunition, obtained from an unknown source for a special service award gun, was found in the possession of Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the fraud, which resulted in the laying of additional charges against him.
In regards to this case, the size of which amounted to 133 tomes, FSIN has filed a lawsuit against the accused for compensation of material damages in the amount of 2.7 billion roubles.
Footballer Hakan Şükür is suspected of involvement in the coup.
Turkish authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Hakan Şükür, a former football player and then a member of parliament, and have carried out searches at his family's two houses.
A star of Turkish football in the 1990s and early 2000s, striker Hakan Şükür is wanted by authorities in connection with the coup attempt that took place last month.
The forward, who ended his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to ‘an armed terrorist group’.
This is in reference to the Hizmet Movement: a society associated with the well-known Turkish religious and opposition leader, Fethullah Gülen.
This is whom President Erdogan considers to be the organiser of the military coup attempt that occurred on 15 July.
Fethullah Gülen lives in the United States, and Turkish authorities are demanding his extradition.
According to local media, today, an arrest warrant was issued for Hakan Şükür, and police have already carried out searches at the two houses that belong to the family of the former football player.
According to investigators, in addition to Hakan Şükür, his father was also part of Fethullah Gülen's organisation.
However, neither the former football player, nor his relatives were there.
Currently, he and his family are living in the United States.
As a football player, Hakan Şükür defended the colours of several Turkish clubs and played for the national team.
He spent the better part of his career with Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italy's Torino, Inter, and Palermo, as well as England's Blackburn.
Although, he never spent more than one season with any of them.
Hakan Şükür still holds the title for highest-scoring striker on Turkey's national team: he has 112 matches for the national team under his belt and scored 51 goals.
In 2013, Hakan Şükür resigned from his parliamentary post as a result of the initiation of corruption investigations surrounding Erdogan's party and his inner circle.
According to the Turkish newspaper, Hurriyet, on 25 July, arrest warrants were issued for at least 42 journalists in Turkey.
They are accused of aiding the military coup and having ties to the oppositionist Islamic preacher, Fethullah Gülen, who is living in the United States.
Given the gravity of the charges, these members of the media can expect lengthy prison sentences ranging from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a chain of cinemas that are only for domestic films.
‘I would create a chain of cinemas that are exclusively for Russian films, and the tickets would cost 2-3 times less than for foreign-produced films’, he said.
Mr Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete with major Hollywood films for viewership.
More than 100 films are made in our country each year, but, on average, only 20-25 films make it to the screen.
‘And it's even very difficult for them to compete with “Transformers” and “Iron Man”, the promotion of which are pumped up with huge budgets’, the film director said.
It bears reminding that, on 1 July, the Tavrida All-Russian Educational Youth Forum started working in Crimea.
The participants include teachers of creative professions and young professionals from various creative fields and disciplines of the humanities from all over Russia and countries of the near and far abroad.
The British women won Olympic gold in pairs rowing
The British women, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, won Olympic gold in pairs rowing.
New Zealanders, Rebecca Scone and Genevieve Beren, took silver, and Anne Andersen and Hedvig Rasmussen from Denmark came in third place.
Kommersant-News: The new general contractor promises to deliver Zenit Arena by 26 December.
The company, Metrostroy, which is the new general contractor for the stadium under construction in Saint Petersburg that is slated to host matches for the 2017 Confederations Cup and the 2018 FIFA World Cup, promises to deliver the arena by 26 December, reports RIA Novosti, with reference to Head of the Temporary Commission of the Federation Council on preparations for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Vadim Tyulpanov.
‘Today, Russia’s Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutko, and I visited the construction site, and Vadim Alexandrov, General Director of Metrostroy, was with us.
He said that he will deliver the stadium by 26 December.
This is a high-profile Saint Petersburg company that never misses a deadline.
Vitaly Mutko and I were impressed by what we saw and heard’, the agency quotes its source as saying.
Vitaly Mutko arrived in Saint Petersburg earlier in order to inspect the venue for the upcoming large-scale competitions.
Mr Tyulpanov also stated that the Federation Council Commission headed by him would continue to monitor the progress of construction of the stadium and would regularly visit the construction site.
To recap, yesterday, it came to light that the company, Metrostroy, would complete construction of Zenit Arena; the value of the contract amounts to approximately 5.4 billion roubles. The same company won the bid for the improvement of areas around the stadium, with a contract value of 2.4 billion roubles. The contracts with JSC Corporation Transstroy, JSC Engineering Corporation Transstroy-SPB, and JSC Engineering Corporation Transstroy were terminated.
Another two companies were not permitted to compete for construction of the stadium.
For more information about the choice of the new general contractor, read the following Kommersant material: ‘Metrostroy has been let onto the pitch’.
In Miass (Chelyabinsk Region), Konstantin Akulich, the lawyer for the former Vice Governor, Nikolai Sandakov, has been detained.
Another lawyer for the accused, Sergei Kolosovsky, told Kommersant-South Ural that Konstantin Akulich was summoned to the Miass branch of the Investigative Committee of Russia today for arraignment on a year-old battery case.
At that time, Konstantin Akulich arrived at the scene of a traffic accident, in the capacity of a lawyer, to assist one of the parties to the accident.
‘Initially, it was filed against unidentified persons. Then, after he began to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akulich’, says Sergei Kolosovsky.
Konstantin Akulich became the ex-vice governor's lawyer at the beginning of August.
Moreover, half an hour before calling the lawyer into the Investigative Committee of Russia in Miass, the defence was notified that the deadline for familiarisation with materials in the case of fraud against Nikolai Sandakov was on Monday.
To recall, two criminal cases were brought against Nikolai Sandakov.
In the first (the fraud case), he is charged with promising to assist in appointing Evgeny Tarasov, Head of the Administration for Ozersk, to the post of mayor of Magnitogorsk for 1.5 million roubles.
The second criminal case concerns bribes that Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from Igor Kalugin, the director of the private security company, Python, in the form of property-related services worth no less than 1.3 million roubles, which were provided illegally at no charge.
For more information about Mr Sandakov, read the following Kommersant material: ‘Former vice governor requests the consolidation of his cases’.
Russian Copper Company (RMK) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is evidenced, for example, by the fact that RMK took on the modernisation of one of the country’s oldest and most ecologically ‘dirty’ enterprises: the Karabash copper smelter.
The Karabash copper smelter was founded by an English joint-stock company, headed by Leslie Urquhart, in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was an industrial enterprise significant to the country's economy and effectively ensured the livelihoods of the entire city.
However, in the 1990s, as a result of financial problems, production was stopped, which led to serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, a decision was made to resume operations at Karabash copper smelter.
It was also critical to solve one of the main problems at the Karabash plant: the environmental issue.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already infamous as an ecological disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmed started to change in 2004, after the enterprise came under the management of Russian Copper Company.
The company started to modernise production, which gradually began to reduce the ecological burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by Boris Dubrovsky, Governor of Chelyabinsk Region, who visited Karabashmed in the first days of July.
The head of the Southern Urals called the changes that have taken place at the plant, since Karabashmed became a part of the RMK Group, grandiose.
In recent years, the flagship modernisation effort at Karabashmed became the construction of a new sulphuric acid plant that allows for the capture of up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to Vsevolod Levin, President of Russian Copper Company, the volume of investments in this project amounted to around 7 billion roubles.
The next stage of modernisation at ZAO Karabashmed is the reconstruction of converter processing.
The replacement of three converters, dust caps, and a flue tract is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
Furthermore, the launch of a new industrial wastewater treatment plant, worth 1 billion roubles, is planned for the end of 2016.
This, in turn, will increase the amount of taxes paid into the budget of the city of Karabash.
Over the entire duration of the Tominskiy Mining and Processing Plant project, from the start of construction up until the commissioning of the second phase of the project, the Federal Treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles.
Once the mining and processing plant is in operation, tax revenues for budgets at all levels could amount to 80.9 billion roubles.
Over the first year of production in Varnensky District, 346.3 million roubles were paid into the budgets of different levels of government.
And this is just for the first year.
‘The longer the enterprise successfully operates, the more money it can contribute’, added Valery Ulanovsky.
RMK confirmed that, in 2015, the tax paid by the Mikheevsky Mining and Processing Plant was close to 1 billion roubles.
However, the involvement of RMK's enterprises in the life and development of the areas of their operations is not limited to tax contributions.
RMK's enterprises are helping to renovate and maintain schools, childcare and sports facilities, build cultural and recreational facilities, and make land improvements.
In 2016, one of Russian Copper Company's largest social projects in Karabash involved capital repairs to, or, in reality, the almost complete overhaul of Childcare Facility No. 9, which serves 95 pupils.
The building, erected in 1960, was in a sad state of disrepair.
The grounds at RMK Arena will also feature a landscaped park with an artificial pond, underground and surface parking for 600 cars, cafes, and sports shops.
RMK Arena will make it possible to host exciting, world-class, professional sporting events.
But the main goal of this project is ensure that residents of Chelyabinsk, and, first and foremost, the children, have access to engage in physical activity and sports in a comfortable environment.

Staff at the Centre for Refugees in Sandholm, Denmark, has become suspicious that the teenagers living there are engaged in prostitution.
The Local reported this on Thursday, 11 August.
According to them, some teenagers told the institution's staff that ‘someone in Copenhagen is organising prostitution’.
As the publication notes, shelter employees started becoming suspicious after the Swedish newspaper, Sydsvenkan, reported similar stories in Malmö.
In 2015, a crisis erupted in the European Union as a result of the influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East.
Denmark has accepted more than 20 thousand of them into country.
A fisherman caught a rare blue lobster off the coast of the Cape Cod peninsula (USA).
The man found the crustacean amongst others caught in his underwater trap, ABC News reports.
The American plans to hand it over to the local aquarium.
The lobster weighs around a kilogramme.
It should be noted that Wayne Nickerson has been catching lobsters for the past 35 years.
According to his spouse, the first time in his career that the man caught a blue lobster was in 1990.
According to ABC News, the crustacean acquires a dark blue or light blue colour as a result of genetic variations.
In April 2016, news broke that fishermen had caught a rare specimen of a deep-water shark, a Megachasma pelagios (a megamouth shark), off the coast of Japan.
The five-meter-long animal weighs around a tonne.
Black Sea Fleet personnel carried out training operations to counter threats of underwater sabotage in areas of the Black Sea.
A representative of the press service of the Ministry of Defence for the Navy, Igor Dygalo, reported to RIA Novosti.
The training was conducted as a part of the first phase of exercises in special naval security operations.
‘Military personnel from underwater anti-sabotage units completed work on countering underwater sabotage threats at a naval base on the coast and in the contiguous waters of the Black Sea’, Dygalo clarified.
Around 400 military personnel and more than 10 pieces of military equipment took part in the exercises, including Mi-8 and Ka-27 helicopters, Rook anti-sabotage boats, and Raptor patrol speedboats.
During the naval manoeuvres, guard ships using sonar located hypothetical special forces units and repelled an attack from the sea by ‘underwater saboteurs’ against a Black Sea Fleet naval base.
A Ka-27 helicopter was used to land an airborne assault group, which blocked and eliminated the special forces of the hypothetical enemy.
Afterwards, Black Sea Fleet minesweeping vessels went out to sea to search for mines.
Dygalo stated that ‘these Black Sea Fleet exercises are being conducted in accordance with plans for the preparation and holding of the upcoming command-staff exercise "Caucasus 2016" and the training plan of the Navy’.
Between 18-30 July, Ukraine and the United States held joint naval exercises in the Black Sea, called ‘Sea Breeze 2016’.
About four thousand people from 16 countries took part in the manoeuvres.
More than 25 ships, boats, and support vessels from the United States, Turkey, Romania, and Ukraine were involved in the naval component.
A Moscow Region court has arrested a father for the murder of his foster daughter: Investigation and trial: Law enforcement agencies: Lenta.ru
The Ozersk City Court in Moscow Region ordered the arrest of Roman Chernikov, who confessed to the murder of his six-year-old foster daughter.
The court's press secretary, Nina Zhilkina, spoke about this on Thursday, 11 August, as reported by Moscow City News Agency.
‘The court has granted a request by investigative authorities for a pre-trial restraining order against Chernikov in the form of detention for two months’, she said.
Chernikov will be held in custody until 9 October.
On 11 August, the Department of the Investigative Committee of Russia for Moscow Region reported that the foster parents and grandmother of the six-year-old girl confessed to her murder.
Specifically, Roman Chernikov said that he committed the child's murder at home on a day in April 2016, as a result of personal enmity and under the influence of alcohol.
Then, in an effort to conceal the child's body, he burned it and, together with his wife, scattered the remains over a large area.
On the evening of 9 August, in an interrogation with an investigator, the foster parents reported that, in April 2016, the six-year-old child had drowned in the bathtub.
They were able to hide the girl's disappearance from everyone for a long time; however, in August, knowing that staff from child protection services would soon be paying them a home visit, they decided to tell everyone that the child had gone missing.
The parents stated that, on 6 August of that year, their foster daughter voluntarily left the site of the house where the family lived and disappeared.
Pope Francis shared a meal with refugees from Syria at the Vatican.
Head of the Holy See Press Office, Greg Burke, said this on Thursday, 11 August, CTV News reports.
The migrants arrived from the Greek island of Lesbos at the invitation of the Pontiff.
The lunch was held at the Vatican's Saint Martha's House, where Francis' private quarters are located.
It is noted that the meal was attended by two groups of Syrian refugees whom the Pontiff visited in Greece on 16 April.
At that time, he took 12 migrants, including six children, aboard his airplane on his return flight to the Vatican.
The second group of Syrians arrived in June.
The Holy See has taken on responsibility for their care.
‘The Pope brought toys and gifts for the children, and they gave him their drawings in return; today, both the children and adults were able to talk with the Pontiff about the first days of his life in Italy’, Burke reported.
During his April visit, the Pope called the migration crisis that erupted in Europe, in 2015, ‘the biggest disaster since the Second World War’.
Greece is one of the countries through which the majority of migrants find their way into Europe.
According to Greek authorities, in 2015, a total of 800 thousand people crossed over from Turkey to the island belonging to Greece in the Aegean Sea.
As a result, Lesbos has become the key transit point for refugees on their way into the EU.
A traffic jam, stretching over 40 kilometres, developed in Japan on the first day of the short summer holidays.
The country's traffic information centre reported this on Thursday, 11 August, RIA Novosti reports.
Thus, in the area of Tochigi Prefecture, the traffic jam spanned for 43 kilometres, while in Kanagawa Prefecture, it was 33 kilometres.
According to the agency, trains were twice as crowded as usual, and tickets on domestic flights were completely sold out.
Starting on 11 August 2016, Japan celebrates Mountain Day and the holiday is considered an official day off.
Afterwards, many Japanese head to their home city for a few days.
The Japanese people's short break will last until at least Tuesday of next week, and that is when a new peak in traffic jams is expected.
In Japan, it is considered bad form to take a full vacation.
By law, citizens are allotted 18 vacation days per year, but most of them limit themselves to a week.

French fashion house, Louis Vuitton, will open a new boutique in Saint Petersburg on 17 September 2016.
It will replace the fashion house's first store, which opened in this city in 2007.
The new boutique will be located on Nevsky Prospekt, a representative for the company told Lenta.ru.
We are pleased to announce the opening of a new store in Saint Petersburg, said Alessandro Valenti, President of Louis Vuitton for Northern Europe, Middle East, and Africa.
Customers can personalise their purchases using hot stamping technology: in honour of the opening, plates with a view of Saint Petersburg were produced that complement the initials of the client.
At the end of the nineteenth century, they designed luggage for the Russian aristocracy: the Grand Duke, Alexander Romanov, the Princess Troubetzkoy, and the imperial family.
Today, they produce clothing, shoes, accessories, jewellery, watches, and have also resumed production of perfumes.
The company is part of the international LVMH group.
A pensioner turns a stepladder into a ‘budget-friendly beach diving platform’.
Online users laughed at photos of an older man setting up a stepladder on the beach and turning it into a diving board.
The picture was posted on several entertainment portals, as well as in the ‘My Taganrog’ group on the VKontakte social network, which is why many decided that the photograph was taken on the shore of the Azov sea.
In the comments, the ‘innovation’ was dubbed a ‘budget-friendly diving platform’ and a ‘mobile diving board’.
Many praised the man for his creativity and ‘resourcefulness’, while others drew attention to the fact that the man runs a serious risk of injury by jumping from his platform, given that he placed it at an insufficient depth.
However, one of the commentators on the Pikabu portal noted that it's impossible to judge the depth of the sea from the picture.
‘First of all, we don't know how deep it is there: the beach could be scattered with sharp drop-offs just a metre in front of the ladder; and, secondly, even if it's only one metre deep there, with the right skills, it's possible to jump from a couple of metres’, wrote a user using the nickname, C0JIbAMDJZ
That being said, the Italian publication, ‘Roma Today’, writes that the man with the ladder was spotted on a beach near Rome.
Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed hope that Anton Vaino, as the new chief of the administration of the head of state, will contribute to its constructive work.
As reported by RIA Novosti, the Russian leader made a corresponding statement at a meeting with Vaino and his predecessor, Sergei Ivanov.
The Russian leader noted that Vaino was recommended by Ivanov himself as a candidate for the position of head of the Presidential Executive Office.
Putin praised the latter for the work accomplished.
On 12 August, Putin removed Ivanov from the post of chief of the administration of the head of state.
Vaino has taken his place in this post.
The authorities of the French city of Cannes have banned visiting local beaches in a burkini: a special bathing suit for women that completely covers the body from the head to the ankles.
ABC News reported this on Friday, 12 August.
The Mayor of Cannes, David Lisnard, explained that this type of clothing ‘ignores the rules of decorum, the principles of secularism, and does not adhere to standards of hygiene and safety’.
Furthermore, according to him, clothing that emphasises religious affiliation may incite disturbances of the peace.
Wearing a burkini will result in a fine in the amount of 38 euros (approximately 42 dollars).
It should be noted that the ban is being imposed against the backdrop of terrorist attacks that occurred on 15 July in Nice and on 26 July in a church in the city of Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray, in the north of the country.
After its introduction, several Muslim women went to court, claiming that the restrictions violate the right to freedom of religion.
The Blagoveshchensk City Court (Amur Region) has sentenced the former head of the city, Alexander Migulya, to nine years in a standard regime penal colony.
This was reported on 12 August on the court's website.
Migulya was found guilty of committing crimes established under Articles 286 ('Excess of power'), 285.1 ('Misappropriation of budgetary funds'), and 285 ('Abuse of official powers') of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
The investigation established that, in December 2008, the official provided his friend with a plot of land in the village of Mukhinka in violation of established land legislation procedures.
In 2006, he unlawfully issued an ordinance for procurement of a road bridge over the Chigiri River for the city, at an over-inflated price, and without tendering procedures or signing a municipal contract, Interfax clarifies.
Moreover, between 2007 and 2010, Migulya, in the interests of a commercial organisation controlled by him, altered the payment dates of a land lease agreement under a purchase and sale agreement, which was granted for the construction of housing, and also absolved the company from paying rent.
As a result, the regional budget was short-changed more than 5 million roubles and the city treasury was out by about 21 million roubles.
On 4 August, it came to light that the former head of the city was in custody on suspicion of corruption and that he was seeking a seat in parliament, but did not provide the Election Commission with signature sheets for participation in the elections to the State Duma on time, and was removed from the election race.
Migulya was arrested in May 2015, in Lipetsk Region, and was placed in a pre-trial detention facility.
Prior to that, he had been on the international wanted list since 2011.
Alexander Migulya held the post of mayor of Blagoveshchensk from November 2004 until April 2010.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has denied reports about the release of a Russian helicopter pilot held captive by the Taliban.
Details about the negotiations were shared by Russian Presidential Envoy to Afghanistan and Director of the Second Asia Department of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zamir Kabulov, in an interview with Interfax on Friday, 12 August.
It was not possible to confirm this information.
‘The crew is still being held captive and negotiations are ongoing’, Kabulov stated.
On 11 August, a source in diplomatic circles told the news agency that the captives had been released.
According to him, the former hostages were transported to Pakistan.
On 4 August, information emerged that a Pakistani Mi-17 helicopter, which had taken off in Peshawar, landed in Logar Province in Eastern Afghanistan as a result of technical problems.
Crimean Bridge construction workers have acquired the anthem, ‘I am driving a pile’.
A video called, ‘I am driving a pile’, has appeared on the YouTube channel of the Crimean Bridge project.
This is a song for the builder of this structure: the central figure says that the bridge will help to ensure that they ‘won't lose touch with this massive country’.
The writer, in particular, sings about how he is ‘driving a pile’.
The music is accompanied by a video from the Crimean Bridge construction site.
The song was written and performed by Konstantin Khomenko, a designer from Institute Giprostroymost-Saint Petersburg, which developed the construction project.
He is not a professional musician.
The Ministry of Interior of Thailand has blamed local saboteurs for explosions at resorts.
The explosions at resorts in Thailand are ‘acts of local sabotage’ and are in no way connected with the activities of international terrorists.
Thailand's police stated this, Reuters reports.
According to law enforcement officials, they have still not been able to ascertain whether any of these explosions are connected.
According to the primary theory, their organisers were attempting to disrupt tourist season.
It cannot be ruled out that Muslim separatists from the south of the country are behind the explosions.
Law enforcement agencies have already detained several people.
At the moment, it is known that there are four dead and several dozen wounded.
The country's Prime Minister, Prayut Chan-ocha, has ordered the implementation of additional security measures to prevent further explosions and rule out additional victims.
A series of explosions occurred at tourist resorts in Thailand on Friday, 12 August.
The devices were detonated at police stations on the island of Phuket, and in the cities of Surat Thani (the capital of the province of the same name, within which the island of Koh Samui is located) and in Hua Hin.
Another explosive device that was planted on the beach was defused by bomb disposal specialists.
One day earlier, on 11 August, two explosions occurred in the resort town of Hua Hin.
The bombs were inside of plant pots and were activated by a call from a mobile phone.
10 foreign tourists are among the victims; there are no Russian citizens among them.
The British jewellery house, Graff, has unveiled a new watch model, The Peacock Watch, which is made in the shape of a peacock feather, Vogue reports.
The watchcase is decorated with loose diamonds.
To accomplish this, the jewellers used not only classic round stones, but also baguettes, as well as bespoke-cut trapezoidal and emerald-cut diamonds.
This watch, with quartz movement and the dark blue hands characteristic of the Graff design, was created in a single copy and is on display at the Mercury boutique in the Moscow Four Seasons Hotel.
The publication did not name its price.
Graff is a jewellery and watch house founded in 1960, in London, by Laurence Graff.
They make jewellery with precious stones, mostly diamonds (including coloured diamonds) and watches (since 2008).
It is a four-time winner of the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the field of international trade (1977, 1994, 2006, 2014).
Over the years, Graff has acquired extremely rare and valuable diamonds, notably: the pink Empress Rose, the Star of America, the Sarah, and others.
JK Rowling's new book, ‘Harry Potter and the Cursed Child’, has become the best-selling in Great Britain, The Daily Mail reports.
The novel pushed ahead of William Shakespeare's play, ‘Romeo and Juliet’, in terms of popularity.
According to the publication, 847,9 thousand copies were sold in the first week following the release of the eighth instalment of the saga about the wizard.
The book, ‘Harry Potter and the Cursed Child’, has brought in 8.76 million pound sterling.
Thus, Shakespeare's tragedy wound up in second place: since 1998, almost 127,7 thousand copies have been sold by the publisher, Penguin Classics.
The eighth instalment of the saga of the wizard from Hogwarts, ‘Harry Potter and the Cursed Child’, was released on 31 July.
The play takes place 19 years after the events described in the book, ‘Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows’.
On the same day, the premiere of the play was staged at the Palace Theatre in London.
In Russia, the English version of the novel hit the shelves of Moscow House of Books, the only official retailer of the novel, on 5 August.
All the copies were sold out within a day.
The new instalment of the saga will be released in Russian by the end of 2016.
The owners of messenger apps and email services must identify users and remove prohibited information: such is the summary of a bill developed by the Media-Communications Union (MKS), which unites Russia's largest communications service providers (Vedomosti has a copy).
Employees from three companies that are members of the union have confirmed that such a proposal is being discussed.
It should be presented to a working group headed by First Deputy Prime Minister, Igor Shuvalov, in early autumn, says Vedomosti's source in the MKS.
The issue concerns amendments to laws on communications and mass media.
They stipulate that any ‘organiser of information disseminated on the internet, which enables the exchange of electronic messages’, is obliged to identify users based on information contained in the service provider's databases, having previously entered into agreements with them.
As well as ‘immediately block messages or publications that contain information that is distributed in violation of the requirements of Russian legislation’.
Alternatively, operators may restrict access to the service based on a decision by Roskomnadzor.
Astronomers have discovered a mysterious space object beyond Neptune.
Astronomers have discovered a mysterious space object beyond Neptune.
The celestial body is very dim and its diameter is about 200 kilometres, the publication, ‘New Scientist’, writes.
According to researchers, the object is moving in an orbit that is completely uncharacteristic of the Solar System.
It is situated almost perpendicular in respect to the other planets.
The mysterious discovery was dubbed, Niku, which, if translated from Chinese, means ‘rebel’ or ‘unconquered’.
WSJ: The United States is considering imposing sanctions against the Russian Federation over the hacking of the Democrats' servers.
US officials are considering imposing new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of the Democratic Party's servers, writes The Wall Street Journal, citing sources.
According to reports, in order to impose sanctions, the administration of President Barack Obama will need to officially accuse Russia of attacking the servers or hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
According to sources, the FBI and other American intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia's involvement in the cyberattack.
The WSJ notes that, generally, the United States prefers not to specifically name those who carry out cyberattacks.
An exception was the hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment’s database in 2014, the responsibility for which was officially placed on the DPRK.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for imposing sanctions against those who engage in or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally aimed against China, but it can also be used against other countries.
The sanctions decision-making process could be lengthy, the newspaper writes.
Even if officials come to the conclusion that the hackers were supported by Russia, they will need to weigh the possible consequences before a decision on the disclosure of such information is made.
They will need to determine if the incident is serious enough for them to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier, it was reported that the Obama administration is considering the possibility of applying sanctions against the state whose hackers broke into the servers of the National Committee of the Democratic Party.
The website, WikiLeaks, published the email correspondence of the Democratic National Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities might be involved in the hack.
The Kremlin has called such reports absurd.
The FAS has fined Google almost half a billion roubles
The reason was a violation of competition in the mobile applications market.
The antitrust proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company argued that Google grants manufacturers of smartphones access to Android components on terms that prohibited the pre-installation of applications from other developers, and, in particular, Yandex.
The FAS has confirmed these claims and found that the company abused its dominant position in the market and forced manufacturers of mobile devices to install other apps alongside the Google Play store.
Following the results of the inquiry, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to penalise Google, said Alexey Dotsenko, Deputy Head of the FAS.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the ruling entering into force.
The FAS concluded that all companies, including multinationals, must comply with the law on the protection of competition.
By the same token, Google intends to first examine the ruling and then determine the next steps to be taken: abide by it or challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service declared the company to be in violation of the competition law back in September of last year and ordered them to adjust their contracts by 18 December.
However, Google refused to agree to this.
Since then, the company and the agency have been involved in litigation.
The FAS has noted that, in spite of the fine, they are discussing the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement with Google.
The current course of action is leading nowhere.
This is the view expressed to Echo of Moscow by Eldar Murtazin, a leading analyst with Mobile Research Group.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would have no impact on either users or on the competitiveness of the corporation.
A Volga Region resident leased a flat and then plundered it to the tune of 84 thousand roubles.
The 30-year-old thief managed to sell the stolen household appliances.
The press service of the regional Main Directorate of the Ministry of the Interior of Russia told a correspondent from MK in Volgograd that, yesterday evening, a resident of a satellite town contacted the police department with a statement about the robbery.
The man told the guardians of the law that an unknown man was leasing a flat from him.
When the owner went to check on his dwelling, he found it completely empty: no washing machine, no television, no fridge, not even the tenant.
The total damages amounted to 84 thousand roubles.
Soon thereafter, the guardians of order were hot on the thief’s trail.
It turned out to be a 30-year-old unemployed Volga Region resident.
The man was arrested and he confessed, stating that he had already managed to sell the stolen property.
Now he will have to answer for the theft to the fullest extent of the law: a criminal case has been opened in relation to the man in custody.
This year, residents of Crimea will receive a notice to pay transport taxes.
Now, residents of the peninsula will pay taxes on land, property, and transport.
The head of the Federal Tax Service for the Republic of Crimea, Roman Nazdrachev, spoke about this at a press conference.
By the end of 2016, Crimean automobile owners will receive a notice to pay transport tax.
So far, the tax agency has counted around 250,000 people owning vehicles.
The State Traffic Safety Inspectorate and the Federal Registration Service will provide information on taxpayers.
‘If, as of the first of January, we receive data on owners of real estate and land, then the citizens of Crimea will be responsible for paying these taxes next year’, stated Roman Nazdrachev.
Citizens entitled to benefits will be granted discounts on the payment of property taxes; first and foremost this concerns the category of pensioners.
Also, there is a system of deductions on land tax, depending on the entitlement category of the taxpayer, but according to the head of the Federal Tax Service, it's too early to talk about this before 2017.
A resident of Balakhna stands up for a woman by smashing in the head of her assailant with a brick
According to investigators, on the night of 16 June 2016, in an area of garages on Main Street in Balakhna, the accused saw that the cohabitants, whom he had visited the night before, were fighting.
The man repeatedly hurt his common-law wife, and then threw the woman over his shoulder and carried her home.
The perpetrator stood up for the woman and repeatedly struck the victim in the head with a brick.
The 29-year-old man died at the scene.
The accused offered a partial admission of guilt.
At the moment (12 August 2016), this is the only information available.
A terrible accident occurred yesterday evening, in the area of the Kiziltash tract on the Crimean Peninsula.
The press service for EMERCOM of Russia in Volgograd Region reported to MK in Volgograd that the commuter bus carrying passengers was travelling along the P-29 Sudak-Feodosia route at 5:05 p.m.
All of a sudden, the vehicle veered into a ditch and fell over a cliff.
Five people were killed in the motor vehicle accident and another 20 were injured.
The injured were taken from the scene of the accident by ambulance service vehicles to medical facilities, where doctors provided them with necessary care.
Four residents from Volgograd Region were seriously injured on that ill-fated journey.
They are Yury and Elena Krivokhizhin from Kotovo and their 9-year-old grandson, Artyom, as well as 5-year-old Anastasia Bochkareva, who was taken to the regional hospital in the city of Simferopol: the girl is in critical condition.
When calling emergency medical services, we hope that the team will arrive quickly and the medics will provide all the necessary professional assistance.
When should emergency medical services be called and how quickly should they reach the patient?
When an emergency call for emergency medical services comes in, the call is routed to the nearest available mobile emergency medical services team or specialised team.
The time it takes for emergency medical services to arrive at an emergency call is up to 20 minutes.
The time it takes for emergency medical services to arrive at an urgent call is up to 2 hours.
There are no official regulations on the time it takes for emergency medical services to arrive in response to a pronouncement of death.
OSCE observers have not recorded military activity on the Crimean border.
Observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have not recorded military activity on the Russian-Ukrainian border.
This is indicated in a statement published on the organisation's website.
The observers report that the situation on the Crimean border is calm, and that no incidents that could be related to the security of Ukraine and Russia have been recorded.
‘Not one of the observers could confirm media reports that concern safety issues, including gunfire and military activities in close proximity to the administrative border’, the OSCE report states.
The organisation's staff continues to monitor the situation at three checkpoints on the border near the Ukrainian cities of Kalanchak and Chaplinka and the Chonhar Peninsula in the Gulf of Sivash.
Earlier, the State Border Service of Ukraine reported that Russian troops were completing a rotation on the Crimean border.
Moreover, the agency claims that the new contingent has more modern equipment.
Bulgaria Posts Inflation for 1st Time in 8 Months
Inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July, national statistics show.
This is the highest value in years (since June 2012) and the first one above zero since October of last year when a positive 0.2% was posted.
The annual average inflation, measured by CPI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, an increase was observed in the price of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); recreation and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%); furnishings, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month in alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any missteps quickly enter the public record.
Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."
And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.
Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."
She added that "it's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.
It shows that the filter isn't just yellowface, but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decisions like this," Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, "or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up."
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.
For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."
Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says
Officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday.
The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this much is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continued.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).
But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.
The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown With Britain
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.
"I have no clue," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.
The first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin.
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.
Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.
The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.
"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.
She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.
She is on a roll.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.
Amid the Fury of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a furious relay of competition and striving.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton, passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on a television, read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor's conversation in a coffee-shop line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, a first-time Olympian and a dimpled heartthrob in the making, may well be among those household names being showcased in prime time, buoyed by sponsorships and feel-good TV commercials, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fencer.
But Mr. Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, Calif., is competing for the gold in Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event equally.
Further from the center, partly in shadow, are those sports not universally acknowledged: air-pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breaststroke, and long may it reign.
But if I may make a modest case for my particular favorite, let me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This may be a regional ignorance.
Despite sending athletes to compete, the United States has never won a medal in trampoline and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to split the prizes for the men, and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year.
But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in part because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics.
Here I should confess that I am no expert, just an earthbound enthusiast.
It does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish el trampolín, meaning "diving board."
Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air, and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves (twists, pikes and somersaults) before eventually landing on their feet.
They are judged on execution, difficulty and "flight time," according to the official Olympic program.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopefuls must go farther, faster, up and over, in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish, other times back and forth up and down the court.
They are chasing not only the finish line or the starting wall but also, in the televised coverage, another taunting line: that of the world, or Olympic, record.
This single-minded pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to bring even a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I find slightly exhausting about even watching the Games.
From this, trampoline offers a respite.
The trampoliner's vector is up.
Forward motion is not the goal.
He or she rebounds, seeming weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
It is not without competition, of course, nor without difficulty, but for the duration of a routine, there is no frantic charge toward the end, no vaulting into the distance, just the dreamy, graceful suspension of time and gravity.
It is as close to Zen as Olympic competition gets.
The women's qualifiers and then finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men's on Saturday, also at 1.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, lovely moment, one likely to be overlooked in the general melee.
And if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up male athletes for ogling and objectification - as the United States men's gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base.
"A Generation Is Protesting" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. Ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government.
Witnesses say that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia about to crack?
For the last decade, it has been one Africa's most stable nations, a solid Western ally with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have convulsed the country, spreading into more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people stormed into the streets, demanding fundamental political change.
The government response, according to human rights groups, was ruthless.
Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos circulating from protests thought to be from late last year or earlier this year show security officers whipping young people with sticks as they were forced to perform handstands against a wall.
The top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa, after Nigeria, and its stability is cherished by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has been expanding at an impressive clip.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And its streets are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited the government's repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been exiled, jailed, killed or driven to the far reaches of the desert.
But that may be changing.
"If you suffocate people and they don't have any other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
The complaints are many, covering everything from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power.
After a widely criticized election last year, the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle along that jagged, disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years, like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm.
Several factors explain why bitter feelings, after years of simmering beneath the surface, are exploding now.
The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it frequently does, especially during protests, many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For eons, Amharas from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But that is changing as well.
"We are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.
The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners.
Analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents.
"The current regime lacks that ground savvy," Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles's shoes.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.
The result, many fear, is more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty.
But clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of Ethiopia's government from intensifying.
And it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and anti-Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently said it closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.
"That," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very tight rope to walk."
Donald Trump Explains His Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his surrogates, who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch, in the awkward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean.
After making the suggestion at a rally on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump doubled down on the assertion on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did intend to say that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early-morning Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump said that he was just being sarcastic.
The post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge.
When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it.
The latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave dueling economic speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to that subject.
Taking again to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."
The approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed.
"I think it's a pattern of him testing certain messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they play, and then "clarifying" one way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates.
But I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses.
Instead of toning things down for a general election audience, Mr. Trump has taken an even more caustic tone in recent days as his poll numbers have continued to tumble.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by large margins in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and locked in a tight race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying there is legitimate, political commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State.
It is true in a sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small little organization, he who called it the jayvee, totally wrong, and here's why it happened, because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to lash out on Twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try to figure him out and said, "They can't!"
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is unfit to be president.
Once Priced Out, a Cafe Returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only space in Williamsburg that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, it got priced out of its Bedford Avenue storefront.
The store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
Locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is change, I know, but still, can't believe CBGB's is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar unpretentious vibe.
The coffee is still good, too.
Leading the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee at the old cafe who is an owner and the general manager at the new place.
He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When a customer offered to bankroll him in a new outpost, he said he was excited to do it.
Mr. Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine.
It even reused the lights from the old Verb.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and toppings like capers and sautéed onions are available.
There are brown-rice bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices.
Nine months in, Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"A lot of former customers got priced out of Williamsburg too," he said.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Ms. Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and went to Verb frequently.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would still make the trek.
After Verb closed, she said, she gave up drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized it was the coffee and the culture at Verb that I liked," she said.
Now she's back on coffee, although that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she went with a blended chai drink, another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, went faithfully to Verb starting in 2003.
He'd go before work and order the same thing without fail.
"Quarter past seven, every day, like clockwork, I'd come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the menu.
These days, Mr. Rosenthal still gets his regular order, but sometimes he'll switch things up with the bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel.
Mr. Rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old space.
In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, using the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we still might take them up on it," Mr. Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have embraced the cafe as well.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other perks.
A local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee.
There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new Verb to get their old favorites is enough.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed.
When the new space opened, Mr. Whitt said, walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I've needed to smell that," he said.
The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.
His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.
"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.
"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.
Strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.
In researching the book, which includes recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.
As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.
"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.
He was fabulously out of touch.
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."
Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.
The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.
"She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."
There was the cream-puff incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Mr. Coe went back for seconds, and thirds.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
The detention of defendants in the case of a mass brawl at Khovanskoye Cemetery has been extended to 14 November
Presnensky Court is keeping defendants in the case of a mass brawl at Khovanskoye Cemetery in detention until 14 November, having granted a corresponding request from investigators.
There are 14 defendants in this case.
Recall that, on 14 May, there was a mass brawl at Khovanskoye Cemetery between hundreds of immigrants from Central Asia and the North Caucasus, which involved the use of weapons and resulted in the deaths of three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yury Chabuev, and a lawyer and co-founder of the public organisation, Healthy Nation, Alexander Bocharnikov, have been charged with organising murder.
The matter of the second indexation of pensions in 2016, could be decided in the next two to three weeks.
This was announced on 12 August, by Deputy Prime Minister, Olga Golodets, during a visit to Bryansk Region.
We have put in place specific parameters as to how much pensions should be increased in order to cancel-out the inflation that exists in the country.
All the calculations have been made.
Right now, economists are taking stock of the past six months and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks’, Interfax quotes Golodets as saying.
Commenting on the plan to increase the retirement age by six months each year, proposed by the head of the Centre for Strategic Research, Alexei Kudrin, the deputy prime minister announced that the cabinet is not considering this subject.
At the end of July, news broke that the government had agreed on a policy to fully index pension benefits in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan made it into the final of the smallbore rifle shooting competition.
Russian athletes, Sergei Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan, made it into the final of the smallbore rifle prone shooting competition at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
TASS reports that Sergei Kamensky earned 629 points and took first place: this is a new Olympic record for the qualifying round.
Kirill Grigoryan was second with 628.9 points.
Only the top eight athletes made it into the final.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish oppositionist, Fethullah Gülen, calls for an international investigation into the circumstances surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey.
‘I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt’, the French newspaper, Le Monde, quotes Gülen as saying.
The Turkish oppositionist also said that, ‘if any part of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey’.
Gülen, however, wholeheartedly denies involvement in the coup, stressing that his organisation has never aspired to political power.
Earlier, the Istanbul Court issued an in absentia arrest warrant for the oppositionist Islamic preacher, Fethullah Gülen.
Recall that a military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of the 15-16 of July.
Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, a U.S. district judge has ruled.
In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
In a filing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city.
They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations," he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns.
"Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Chilli-powder condoms, firecrackers boost Tanzania elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way of keeping elephants from wandering into human settlements - by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
The method has proved effective and Honeyguide Foundation, which hit upon the idea several years ago, with U.S.-based Nature Conservancy has stepped up its promotion, training volunteers in villages in north Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step way of protecting their homes and crops without hurting the animals.
Previously many used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of the animals.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen an attitude change within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps involve shining a torch at the trespassing elephant and sounding a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chilli cloud" is thrown.
Chilli powder mixed with soil is packed with a firecracker into a condom, its end is twisted shut with just the fuse exposed.
When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang, spraying a fine dust of chilli powder into the air.
One whiff is usually enough to send an elephant the other way.
A last resort is a launcher that shoots a Roman candle firework into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
32 Turkish diplomats who left the country after the coup attempt in July of this year have still not returned to Turkey.
This information was presented by Turkey’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, in a discussion with local journalists.
As a first step, we recalled 208 career diplomats, so that they could continue work in the centre.
32 of them, without objective reasons or explanations, have not returned’, said the head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
Recall that a coup attempt took place in Turkey in July.
Country authorities officially announced that the coup had failed, and also reported the arrest of more than six thousand people, including senior and mid-level military officials.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, 290 people were killed as a result of the coup attempt.
Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers.
Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.
The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.
How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center.
Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.
The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."
The hotel's clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."
The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
It is in itself a great shame.
The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.
That needs no explanation.
We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.
Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.
"Shame on you," another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue.
The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.
It adds that the code was now added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.
Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money.
Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia & Iran surges 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has grown 70.9 percent in year-on-year terms, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been a surge in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are resuming existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to get access to the market.
Of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period of 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The boost in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia.
It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
The state continues to tighten the screws on the military-industrial complex.
‘Systematic failure to implement’ the orders of the director general of Almaz-Antey Concern, ‘shortcomings in work’, and ‘a loss of trust’ were the grounds for the dismissal.
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed head of the scientific production association for the next three years.
Information about Neskorodov's dismissal only appeared on Thursday evening and didn't evoke a wide response in the media.
How can such silence in the face of a major rearmament of the military be explained?
Most likely, the Russian leadership does not want any rumours or negative speculation circulating in the public sphere.
This, once again, confirms that there are many problems within the military-industrial complex (MIC), and the government does not want to attract the public's attention to them.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event from the perspective of restoring order in the industry.
The Almaz Scientific Production Association is the concern's principal enterprise, which specialises in the production of sea and land-based air defence missile systems (ADMS).
Currently, Almaz is working on the development of the Poliment-Redut and Morpheus ADMSs, which are slated to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers, and cruisers.
Dmitry Kornev, founder of the internet portal, Military Russia, believes that Neskorodov's dismissal was brought about by a failure to meet the delivery deadlines for these projects.
This theory is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began back in 2007, and it was expected to be put into commission in 2013.
Poliment-Redut is set to be the main antiaircraft defence system on the Navy's newest vessels.
According to the information I'm receiving, over several years of testing, there hasn't been a single truly successful test.
Granted, as far as I can gather, Almaz is not entirely to blame for this, Kornev said.
The expert fears that a delay could also occur in the commissioning of the S-500 ADMS.
Development and engineering work on the project is still not completed, but the first systems are supposed to be operational in 2016.
The Ministry of Defence assured that ‘work is going according to plan and everything will be completed within the prescribed time limits’, although, in 2014, the department admitted that there are problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional abilities of Neskorodov, who had been in charge of Almaz since 2011.
Kornev noted that the failure to meet delivery deadlines for the projects could be both a pretext and the reason for the dismissal.
In his opinion, over the past few years, it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about the internal dealings of the military industrial complex and about the management plans of enterprises.
The industry received long-term contracts worth tens of billions of roubles, and, as is well know, big money loves peace and quiet.
As a rule, directors of defence companies resign from a post of their own accord, according to an agreement of mutual understanding between the parties, or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the removal happened publicly, even if it didn't evoke a response.
This suggests that the head of Almaz was, perhaps, an obstinate figure, and resisted an ‘order’ issued from above.
It would appear that the state no longer intends to put up with such behaviour.
It will use the shareholders to remove those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defence’s directives and do not fulfil assigned tasks.
At the same time, the Russian leadership is aiming to punish managers who have been caught stealing (fraud at the Zvezda shipyard).
The President is personally paying greater attention to problems in this sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin defends a number of managers in the military-industrial complex, with the aim of having a loyal group of directors on hand, who will implement orders received from above.
It's a far from ideal policy, but amidst rampant corruption and the absence of real competition in the military-industrial complex, the state doesn't have any other instruments.
Of course, the current situation in the defence industry isn't catastrophic, but the present geopolitical environment is galvanising the Kremlin to whip the Armed Forces into shape as quickly as possible.
Alongside the ‘crackdown’ on managers in the military-industrial complex, the Russian leadership is taking quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The army's professional personnel have acquired a new level of quality since the advent of Sergei Shoigu to the post of defence minister.
You get the impression that the President has taken to heart the famous expression: ‘If you want peace, prepare for war’.
During the Cold War, the military might of the USSR and nuclear parity reached in the 1970s, led to the signing of the Helsinki Pact, which cemented Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.
For all of the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
The absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East were proof of this.
The triumph of the ‘winners’ of the Cold War eventually turned into a strengthening of international terrorism.
Following a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States, there is probably not a single peaceful corner left in the ‘civilised world’.
In spite of this shared peril, the West refuses to engage with Russia as an equal partner.
In such circumstances, the only allies our country has left are the navy and the army.
A military build-up will enable Moscow to effectively advance national interests and break new ground in global affairs.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.
The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.
They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.
He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.
Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."
We all as a team came together in the last three months.
We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London.
If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits.
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
That would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
The team event is always the best.
You get to win it with your mates.
It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.
Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.
He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.
After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again.
Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.
The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.
A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.
And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.
The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant.
AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," it said.
AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.
Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event."
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."
The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
And as a generator that wouldn't be good for us," he said.
Not just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall's on the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of mother-manager Kris's Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of US Vogue's coveted September issue.
Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room with a bunch of people I love, looking at this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-esque?), scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favourite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, only to end with the classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party.
It's the cliche plot line of nearly every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow.
Because, with a spot on Vogue's September issue, we have surely entered a new era of Kardashian.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her to the cover of Vogue (she shared it with husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a league unto itself.
The September Issue is Vogue's highest selling edition of the year.
With a thickness more closely resembling a coffee table book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashionista counted 615 of last year's 832-page tome as advertising content).
The revelation of its cover star is so hotly anticipated that, in the past two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Previous women to feature on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities."
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured in 2013, the year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But, even on the off-chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakout model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, or reality stars, or kids these days who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things).
They are legitimately talented women, excelling in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on last year's cover, has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is pleased about Jenner's success.
With her reality television history, Jenner's position within the fashion world was always going to be fraught.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them the "bitches of the moment."
This sentiment has boiled up again with the news of Jenner's Vogue cover appearance.
But dwelling on the discontent seems beside the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
She's walking for Marc Jacobs.
She's selling you Estee Lauder foundation.
She, and all of her sisters, are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective paywalled apps.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter she photographed to LOVE magazine.
And, in her downtime, possibly just as a way still to see sister Kourtney and her kids, she's on reality television.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year, with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.
Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.
Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.
It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.
"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.
For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat-and-mouse game" over ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a "cat-and-mouse game," according to one of the companies that makes that software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads.
But Adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented," and that it is possible Facebook would come up with its own fix soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad blockers have become for the industry.
Globally, roughly 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year from Pagefair and Adobe; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company is going after ad blockers on desktop however, because mobile ad blockers are not effective in Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Desktop ads still account for enough revenue that Facebook judged such a move to be worth the investment.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would be updating its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were concerning because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This isn't a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement.
Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
A woman lay down in the dark on the road "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
Was it possible to avoid impact?
That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement.
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.
We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and right across the country, we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of around $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they ever will.
At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Two agencies are conducting an investigation into the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea, Kommersant writes.
The FSB is collecting evidence linking the detained individuals to the organisation of subversive activities in Crimea.
As previously reported, a confession was made by Evgeny Panov, a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armyansk, the oil depot in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields as potential targets for sabotage.
Law enforcement officials believe that far from all of the saboteurs' accomplices have been apprehended.
This, in particular, served as grounds for arrest of the suspects at the Kiev District Court in Simferopol, the publication notes.
Stanislav Cherchesov has become the head coach of the Russian national football team
A decision was made at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with him will last for two years, until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On 11 August, the Executive Committee of the RFU appointed Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
He is a well-known footballer, who formerly played for Spartak Moscow in the position of goalkeeper, and is also a coach with solid experience, who was the trainer for such Russian teams as the one and very same Spartak, Zhemchuzhina-Sochi, Terek, Amkar, Dynamo, and also Legia Warsaw, which won the national championship and the country's cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the near future and that it will last two years.
As such, the responsibility falls on him to prepare the team for the 2018 World Championship.
It's known that Miroslav Romaschenko, Gintaras Staučė, and Vladimir Panikov will be part of his coaching staff.
There is information that suggests that the salaries for the whole coaching staff will amount to 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to media sources, the leadership of the RFU has set a goal for Stanislav Cherchesov to get the Russian national team to the semi-finals and to win medals.
The coach himself stated that he considers creating a competitive environment on the team as a matter of priority and is going to give the football players an opportunity to prove themselves.
Furthermore, according to Cherchesov, he's happy that he was the one chosen.
The Russian team will have its first match under the direction of Cherchesov on 31 August, in Antalya: it will be a friendly match against the Turkish team.
Recall that the post of head coach of the Russian national football team was previously held by Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with coaching the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after a disastrous performance by the Russia national team at Euro 2016 in France.
Having said that, he took personal responsibility for the team's poor showing.
Sandwiched between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, after attaining independence from South Africa in 1990, this country, with a population of 2.4 million people, has achieved tremendous success, especially over the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the government pays a lot of attention to education.
While people in developed countries take for granted free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries, secondary and even elementary schools require tuition fees.
Furthermore, governments are often advised to introduce fees for education for the purpose of ‘cost recovery’.
In Namibia, however, education in primary schools is free.
Moreover, starting in 2015, secondary education also became free.
The country's leaders are also actively working on other important areas.
Efforts to eliminate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97% over the past ten years.
In contrast to the international trend of growing inequality, in Namibia, it is shrinking.
Compared to the figure for 1993, the Gini coefficient, which is the standard measure of inequality in income distribution, fell by 15 points.
Back then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
While the poverty rate has fallen from 69% in 1993, to less than 30%.
The number of people living in conditions of abject poverty (less than $1.90 a day) has also fallen from almost 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest rating for freedom of speech in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country is significantly ahead of the United States and other wealthy countries.
Additionally, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the Corruption Perceptions Index, which is compiled by human rights activists from Transparency International.
Even now, when commodity prices are falling, Namibia manages to maintain high growth rates.
Meanwhile, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than a 1/3 of the level of debt in the United States and in the majority of European countries.
Of course, Namibia still has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional assessment methods, still remains quite high at almost 28%.
Also, as with other countries in the region, there is a high incidence of HIV/AIDS in Namibia: almost 17% of the population are infected.
According to the World Bank, Namibia belongs to the group of upper middle-income countries, but the authorities insist that their state is actually a developing country.
Namibia, of course, faces some difficulties that are typical of underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very big and arid country with a small population.
Isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers, which somehow need to be integrated into modern society without losing their identity, live throughout the country in deserts.
The integration of people who, a quarter of a century ago, were on the periphery of the world economy, is a difficult task for any country.
It is even more difficult for Namibia: like every other country in the world, it is being faced with the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia never thought of giving up; the country is dealing with the problems it faces.
Almost immediately after attaining independence, the authorities got to work on creating a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions came together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides inexpensive medical services not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20% of visitors to medical facilities in the northern areas of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia talks about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbours.
Namibians understand that you can't choose your neighbours, and, as such, decided not to pick a fight with them, but to cooperate instead: to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional health projects, to promote investments and the exchange of students.
In addition to this, the Namibian government rightly decided that rich natural resources can just as easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of a few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that the profits from Namibia's natural resources need to be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.
They also realise that it would be irresponsible not to try and maximise profits from the sale of the country's resources, and are revising investment laws and production contracts to make sure that this is being done.
Transparency is critical to this process, and that is why the government's strong support for freedom of speech is so important.
As the head of state, Hage Geingob, noted, the media often says things he doesn't like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia needs to protect the freedoms it has gained, the President says.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are non-renewable.
Some of them, such as the fishing industry, are renewable, and the government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia demonstrates that even those countries that begin with serious flaws – racism, colonial systems, inequality, and a low level of development – can embark on a path to shared prosperity.
Its achievements deserve international recognition and emulation.
Many have heard about the ‘Varna Gold’, the earliest gold objects created by man (4600-4200 BC).
It was probably the biggest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during excavations of the Varna Necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artefacts were found - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilogrammes.
990 gold objects, weighing more than 1.5 kg, were recovered from just one burial site, known as ‘Grave No. 43’.
However, the official title of oldest gold in the world may soon be handed over to a rather insignificant-looking bead found by archaeologists in July of this year.
Notably, it was also found in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunatsite.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunatsite is located inland, near the village of Yunatsite in Pazardzhik District.
The bead is made from a gold band rolled into a ring.
Yavor Boyadzhiev, leader of the excavation at Tell Yunatsite, has dated the find at 4600 BC and said that it's older than the gold of Varna by at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna, you will recall, date from around the same period, 4600-4200 BC.
Currently, no technology exists that makes it possible to date metal with perfect accuracy.
So, where is the certainty about which gold is more ancient coming from?
Obviously, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters news agency: ‘I am absolutely sure that the Yunatsite gold is older than the Varna gold’.
This is a discovery of extraordinary importance: it looks like a tiny object, but it is big enough to take its rightful place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiev announced that, in the near future, scientists will analyse the composition of the metal, and will once again examine, and this time more thoroughly, the archaeological layer where the gold artefact was found.
This will help to date the bead as accurately as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell Yunatsite is a well-known settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Currently, Tell Yunatsite is considered to be the most ancient ‘city’ in Europe.
Tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
Over the course of the following centuries, metalworking rapidly developed in this region: from the acquisition of the first metallurgical skills, to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the local historiography, there is a special name for this archaeological community: the Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban settlements started to emerge around the metalworking centres.
Now they are called the most ancient cities of Europe.
Tell Yunatsite is quite possibly the most ancient of them all, given that artefacts from 4900 BC have been found here.
I would call Tell Yunatsite a prototype of the modern city, despite the fact that it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
‘This place is older than Sumer by a thousand years’, says Boyadzhiev, bearing in mind the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in Southern Mesopotamia, which is modern Iraq.
That is where the first cities, in the usual sense of the word, arose.
The excavation of Tell Yunatsite has been underway since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about one third of the total estimated area of the settlement.
The remains of a fortress wall, which, at one time, reached a height of three metres, were discovered.
Little has survived from the houses and workshops, but archaeologists can distinctly make out streets, public buildings, dense urban housing, a ‘business centre’, and residential suburbs.
Tell Yunatsite is often called the ‘Bird City’: dozens of clay bird figurines were found here.
All of the birds were depicted at rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but rather the subject of a local cult.
The ‘Bird City’ was destroyed around 4100 BC, possibly by Indo-European tribes that came from the northeast.
The nomads didn’t have cities, but did have horses and weapons.
The three-metre-high fortress walls didn't stop them.
Archaeologists have discovered obvious signs of a brutal massacre: the remains of elderly people, women, and children, with evidence of wounds inflicted by battle-axes, were found inside of the houses.
New discoveries and new facts are emerging every year, changing the accepted understanding of the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the ‘lost’ first civilisation of Europe that originated in the Balkans.
The ‘Varna Gold’, found relatively recently, in 1972, became a powerful stimulus in the search for this civilisation.
It is logical that something had to precede the golden luxury of Varna: something like a tiny gold bead created in Tell Yunatsite.
Porsche has artificially aged the 911 Targa model
It has been officially announced that the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being hand-finished by experts from the division that works with production vehicles.
The ‘retro look’ is achieved, for example, by using the special Blue Etna colour on the body, which was developed back in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model; even the logo of this model is painted in this colour.
Additionally, the Targa received the signature white graphics along its sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel rims, as well as some parts of the body design painted in ‘white-gold metallic’.
The retro feel is considerably less noticeable in the interior: essentially, it is distinguished by its grey-blue tones, the new power seats with extended range, and finishes like the black anodised steel door sill guards with the logo of the division.
To top it off, when purchasing this limited edition, each buyer will receive a free vehicle cover and a richly decorated album containing photographs of the production process.
The experts at Porsche Exclusive didn't even lay their hands on the powertrain: the characteristics of the retro Targa are exactly the same as the standard production model.
It is equipped with a 3.0-litre, six-cylinder turbocharged engine, producing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version is the 911 Targa 4S, which is capable of accelerating to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released as a limited edition, but neither the number, nor the cost of each specific sports car have been reported.
Facebook and ad blockers have unleashed an ‘arms race’
Facebook's recent introduction of a technology, which prevents the hiding of advertisements on pages of the social network, has sparked a tit-for-tat response from developers of ad-blocking technologies.
AdBlock Plus has released an ‘antidote’, but Facebook plans on making even this useless before long.
So, AdBlock Plus advertised their new technology, which is unlikely to remain effective for long
Representatives from the social network noted that, in an effort circumvent the new technology of ‘unblockable’ advertisements, AdBlock Plus' technology also blocks regular posts from friends and pages in addition to commercials.
Facebook expressed regret about the policy of AdBlock Plus and promised to fix the problem shortly.
A source within the developers of the social network told the publication, ‘TechCrunch’, that a code, which will make AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop version of Facebook, will be ready within the next few hours.
In this way, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of ‘arms race’, trying to one-up each other: the aggrieved party turned out to be the users, who missed interesting posts from their friends or saw advertisements where they weren't used to seeing them.
The ethical aspects of blocking advertisements have caused heated arguments as of late.
A rapist will stand trial in Murmansk · Vecherniy Murmansk.
The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for Murmansk Region has already completed the investigation into his case.
The charges filed against the 54-year-old man are very serious: the commission of sexual battery.
The investigation established that, at the end of November 2015, the accused committed sexual battery against a 20-year-old young woman in the vicinity of Pavlov Street in Murmansk. A criminal case, with an approved indictment, has been submitted for consideration on merits.
The penalty for this article provides for a maximum punishment of imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring the Fengguang 370 crossvan and the Rich New pickup truck to Russia – Za Rulem website www.zr.ru
The Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is representative of a class of automobiles, combining the advantages of a minivan and a crossover, which is gaining popularity in China.
Another new model announced for Russia is the Rich New pickup truck.
Many Western companies decided to ignore the Moscow International Motor Show this year, so Chinese companies will fill up the empty spaces at Crocus Expo's exhibition halls.
In particular, a strong showing will be made by the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has big plans for the Russian market and intends to offer our car enthusiasts a number of interesting new models in the near future.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossvan, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (slightly less than 550 thousand roubles at the current exchange rate).
It's doubtful that Russian citizens will every see it at that price, and the issue of delivery into our country is still in the discussion stage.
In China, by the way, the Fengguang 370 managed to take 11th place on the list of best-selling minivans according to June sales, even though, given its high ground clearance (175 mm) and protective, plastic lower-body moulding, it could also be classified as a crossover.
The crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the older Fengguang 360 model: the 370 has the same wheelbase, 2,725 mm, but its body is slightly longer (4,565 mm to 4,510 mm), it has a more solid design, and is better equipped.
The interior is decorated with wood panelling, but a photo showing a large vertical touch screen, ‘like a Tesla’, in the centre console was only included in the early exhibition models of the crossvan, whereas the ‘sound system’ in vehicles for sale is more basic.
Five of the seven seats easily fold to produce a flat loading area with a length of 1,650 mm, while the maximum trunk capacity is 1,500 L.
The Fengguang 370 is fitted with just one 1.5 L gasoline ‘aspirated’ engine, with 115 hp of output, connected to a 5-speed manual transmission.
The manufacturer is coyly silent about the performance qualities of the car, but promises to be merciful on the owner's budget with an appetite of just 6.7 L/100 km.
The Rich New pickup truck is familiar to Russians as the previous generation Nissan NP300 Navara, but with a design that has been slightly refined by Chinese stylists.
In spite of the outdated design, this model still enjoys a steady demand among Chinese consumers as a reliable and low-maintenance ‘workhorse’.
At a similar price, the Rich New will surely be of interest to Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
The Rich New comes equipped with two choices of engines: a 2.4 L gasoline engine (137 hp) or a 2.5 L turbodiesel engine (116 hp).
It only comes in a standard transmission with rear-wheel drive, but there are upgrades and an option of part-time 4WD.
The new flagship A9 sedan will also be at the Dongfeng booth; a representative from the Chinese company announced its Russian premiere back in June.
There are increasingly more minivan-type crossovers in the Chinese market; some of the latest new models are the Cowin V3 and the X7 SWM.
Currently, Dongfeng's Russian line consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
Over the first seven months of this year, dealers for the Chinese company sold 696 vehicles in our country.
Transport tax notices will no longer be sent by mail – Za Rulem website www.zr.ru
The tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending tax assessment notices.
All Russian automobile owners have become accustomed to the system, which has not changed in years: in the summer and fall, they receive a transport tax bill in the mail for the previous year.
However, this year, many of them will be waiting for nothing.
The fact is that the tax inspectorate has quietly changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
Those who signed up for a ‘Personal Taxpayer Account’ on the agency's official website, nalog.ru, will receive notifications in electronic form.
The inspectorate automatically considered those Russians citizens as online users and deleted them from the standard ‘paper’ mailing list.
This new way of doing things will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will receive the same familiar letters as before.
However, it is possible for website account holders to go back to the old system.
To do this, they must visit an office of the tax service during August and file a request.
On the one hand, the new process is more modern and convenient.
A notification will appear on the ‘personal account’ right after it is prepared, whereas a letter will have to travel several days and can even be lost altogether.
On top of that, the number of users of the tax inspectorate's internet service has grown to more than 18 million people, which enables the agency to save substantially on postage.
On the other hand, the meagre news on the inspectorate's website is clearly insufficient to inform citizens about the changed process.
Some people could have registered for a ‘personal account’ for a one-time service and have long since forgotten about it.
These people will not receive notification by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the same category as tax evaders, with all the ensuing consequences.
Access to the ‘Personal Taxpayer Account’ can be achieved three ways: through a user account on the gosuslugi.ru portal, by using an electronic signature, or by entering the login and password specified on a registration card.
The latter can be obtained in-person at any tax office (regardless of place of registration).
It bears reminding that, this year, the transport tax must be paid by 1 December.
The mail out of notifications began in July.
The souped-up Mercedes-Benz G class, whose improvements are aimed at achieving very high performance, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confound the experts at the company, G-Power, who tackled the redesign of the sport version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its proclivity for BMW vehicles, but, at the end of the day, to their experts, a vehicle is a vehicle.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63: a 571-hp flying sledgehammer, with the aerodynamics of a tank, that goes from zero to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
To beef up the ‘muscles’ of this crazy ‘Gelik’, the experts took advantage of the benefits offered by the 5.5-litre supercharged V8 engine.
Well, the speed at which it accelerates from zero to a hundred improved by an indiscernible 0.1 second: now the flying ‘brick’ is capable of hitting 100 in 5.3 seconds.
Mind you, acceleration at average speeds is, for sure, discernibly easier for it.
The top speed is terrifying: while the standard G 63 can't go faster than 210 km/h, the souped-up SUV, with a deactivated electronic ‘collar’, is capable of hitting 250 km/h.
From the outside, the vehicle is almost indistinguishable from the factory original, with the exception of different wheel rims: 23-inch Hurricane RR with 305/35ZR23 size tyres.
The luxury division, Mercedes-Maybach, has announced a striking, 6-metre-long concept coupe, which will be unveiled at the Concours d'Elegance in Pebble Beach.
Mercedes-Benz intends to compete with the ‘green sub-brand’, BMW i, and will promote their electric models under a separate brand.
In the coming years, the debut of at least four new eco-friendly models is expected.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law on the establishment of administrative liability for violating the deadline and procedures for payment of goods (works, services) as part of procurement for state and municipal needs.
This law is meant to solve the very serious issue of customers failing to fulfill their commitments as part of state and municipal procurements.
Just two years ago, situations in which business owners were unable to collect payment for already-executed state and municipal contracts were widespread.
At that time, the Russian president tasked the Office of Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation with taking the issue under special control.
After all, businessmen couldn’t deal on their own with dishonest customers who signed agreements without financial backing, tried their best to get out of assumed payment commitments, and included illegal conditions in agreements.
The problem was systemic throughout the entire country.
Since 2015, 9,700 petitions, in the interests of protecting the rights of business owners to receive payment for public contracts, were filed by the Office of the Prosecutor General: according to the results of their investigations, 4,500 officials were subject to disciplinary measures, and 533 were held administratively liable; 75 cases were submitted to the investigative authorities for procedural review, and criminal proceedings were initiated in 46 of them.
In sum, more than 66 billion rubles worth of debt owed to business owners was repaid.
Notably, these vast sums were by no means accrued as a result of non-payment of multibillion-ruble contracts.
Numerous systematic delays in payment for services to business owners for considerably more modest amounts led to these jaw-dropping debts.
Here is a typical case.
The head of a small company won a tender for the provision of social transport services worth several million rubles.
The person invested all of their working capital, fully satisfied their commitments, but didn’t receive the allotted money when it was due.
The result is an escalating financial snowball comprised of payroll, tax, and loan liabilities, which would have led to bankruptcy if the business owner hadn’t approached the prosecutor’s office for assistance.
Now, in a number of regions, they have managed to mitigate the problem to the greatest extent possible.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt related to state and municipal contracts, identified by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to approximately 27.4 billion rubles.
In the regions where debt indicators continue to climb to critical levels, the prosecutor’s office has adopted a hands-on approach to crisis management.
The prosecutor general is personally holding on-site meetings with local officials, during which they substantively examine all of the violations uncovered by the prosecutors and the measures aimed at their immediate rectification.
This year, these types of briefing sessions have already taken place in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
The realization of Federal Law No. 189-FZ “On amending the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in terms of establishing administrative liability for officials of a customer for violating the deadline and procedures for payment of goods (works, services) as part of procurement for state and municipal needs”, which was signed by the Russian president last week, will qualitatively improve the payment discipline of public sector customers.
The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade of the Russian Federation developed the bill at the request of the Office of the Prosecutor General.
The new law will add an article to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences, which stipulates a penalty of between 30,000 and 50,000 rubles for violation of the deadline and procedures for payment of goods, works, or services as part of state and municipal procurements by an official of a customer.
However, if the official has already been subject to administrative punishment for a similar offense, then they will be suspended for a period of between one to two years.
All the prosecutors for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already received instructions to enforce the application of these legislative innovations in practice.
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.
A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.
They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.
"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.
"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.
Two people have died as a result of a shooting of a police patrol in Egypt
The unidentified individuals shot at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Esna, Reuters reports with reference to Egypt’s Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Two people, including one police officer, were killed during the shooting, and three people suffered injuries.
All the wounded were taken to hospital.
According to the agency, the police officers stopped a vehicle, at which point the two armed individuals inside of the car opened fire on the law enforcement officials.
One of the perpetrators has been apprehended, but the second managed to escape.
The Russian Federal Tourism Agency supports the law eliminating the free baggage allowance for non-refundable airline tickets
The head of the Russian Federal Tourism Agency, Oleg Safonov, said in an interview with RBK television channel that he is “in favor” of adopting a law eliminating the free baggage allowance for non-refundable airline tickets.
“We need to establish conditions whereby a person who doesn’t have baggage can purchase a cheaper ticket than a person who has baggage”, he emphasized (quoted by TASS).
In addition to this, Mr. Safonov noted that, in spite of the concerns of citizens, there would be no need to pay for outerwear or mobile phones in carry-on baggage.
“It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to make an announcement about this, to say that this will have nothing to do with outerwear, umbrellas, mobile phones, iPads, or even some computers”, the head of the Russian Federal Tourism Agency said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law giving airline companies the right to eliminate the free baggage allowance rule on non-refundable airline tickets.
The point of the issue is that airline companies are free to determine the number of seats and weight of baggage at the non-refundable rate.
Vladimir Putin has ordered the cleanup of pollution in Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting concerning the protection of Baikal, reported that, over the past several years, significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme contamination.
He instructed that sources of financing, plans, and those responsible for implementing the cleanup of the pollution be identified.
Mr. Putin also ordered that a full-fledged reclamation of polluted areas be conducted.
“It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to operate here; the sewage treatment plants, the majority of them are worn-out”, RIA Novosti quotes the president as saying.
He also added that the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation should conduct an inquiry to identify environmentally destructive activities.
According to him, there are problems connected to illegal dumping and a range of environmental violations by recreation operators in the area around the lake.
“I would like to emphasize this: there’s no need to inspect everything in sight – we also need to know where to draw the line – but specifically illegal and environmentally destructive activities and then take appropriate measures”, he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General’s Office reported a reduction of fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed increasing the number of facilities subject to environmental supervision.
You will recall that on June 15, during the direct line, Vladimir Putin spoke about the necessity of changing legislation to ensure the protection of the rights of citizens living in natural areas under the special protection regime.
Residents of Olkhon Island, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory, let him know about problems with conducting business activities.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Sergei Donskoi, immediately offered to solve the problem by amending the borders of Lake Baikal’s water protection zone, but the Government of Buryatia reminded that such a change would be insufficient given that the restrictions are tied to a whole range of regulatory acts.
Previously, the Ministry of Economic Development proposed solving the problem by amending the land code and the law on environmental protection.
There will be a new church in Yurga
In the village of Sosva, members of the Rakhtynya community of indigenous peoples of the North, along with residents of Berezovsky District, will take part in the construction of an orthodox church in honor of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location will be on the riverbank: the church will be easily visible from far away, so it will serve as a steering landmark for fishermen.
According to members of the community, construction work will already be completed this year: so far the dome has been installed, and the church bell is on hand.
The Igrimsk Fleet Repair and Operational Base provided transport services.
The church was named in honor of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker, since the Orthodox Church venerates him as the patron of travellers, including fishermen.
After all, in Sosva, the fishing industry provides settlers with work and feeds them.
Local residents are waiting for the day the church opens its doors, and children are even writing school compositions about it as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are laws obeyed in Singapore?
I am talking with a local businessman, Chang, while sitting in an open-air eatery.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while carefully placing the butts into a small iron box he brought with him from the office.
After finishing our conversation, the businessman heads toward the nearest trashcan (it’s about 100 meters away) and dumps the butts into it.
The fine for littering in public places is 500 local dollars, Chang says.
You know, it’s a simple reflex I developed in my childhood: it’s forbidden to throw a candy wrapper onto the pavement; they will fine you instantly.
Nowadays, the fact is, there are cameras everywhere.
And it’s true: the sidewalks in downtown Singapore are clean, as if in a museum.
Chang says that, three months ago, his neighbor’s 18-year-old son wrote graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the boy guilty of vandalism and he was sentenced to flogging.
What?!
Just imagine.
He received ten lashings with a wooden cane to his buttocks and spent a week in jail.
Here, in general, corporal punishment is not uncommon.
AiF’s staff writer understood, right then and there, how exceptionally high living standards and unbelievably harsh laws go together in Singapore.
Here, no one is concerned with abolishing the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government stopped caring a long time ago about the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this matter.
If a person smuggles in a large shipment of drugs or sells them, then they are sent to the gallows.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi airport: he was carrying 400 g of cocaine on him.
The Australian prime minister (threatening sanctions), international human rights advocates, and even the Pope came to his defense.
Nevertheless, the boy still ended up being hanged.
Since then, drug traffickers carefully bypass our country.
Here’s the deal: in Singapore, the rule is that absolutely EVERYONE must obey the laws, not just simple people and those of modest means.
It doesn’t matter who you are: a millionaire, the vice prime minister, a famous actor, or a resident of the European Union.
There is only one outcome in the given situation: if they find half a kilo of cocaine on you, then you will be hanged.
When you’re walking around Singapore and come across signs with lots of warnings everywhere, you’re simply astonished by just how many bans there are in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is only sold in pharmacies, and it can only by bought with a doctor’s prescription!
They won’t confiscate a tourist’s gum upon arrival, but should you stick your gum in the metro, they will slap you with a fine of 1,000 local dollars.
In the span of four days, I ran into two people with white signs around their necks that said, “I littered”.
For cigarette butts tossed beside a garbage can, in addition to a fine, they often impose a sentence of “grounds cleaning exile”: cleaning parks and beaches for a week.
A “criminal” who forgets to flush a public toilet after themselves pays 6,000 rubles, while a special detector is activated in the event of an attempt to relieve oneself in the elevator of a residential apartment building: the doors are locked and a signal is sent to the police.
Some of the most unusual laws include: bans on feeding pigeons in the street, singing songs in public, and even overwatering indoor plants (it is believed that an abundance of water attracts mosquitos)!
To prevent fires, smokers are forbidden from bringing lighters into the metro, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singapore dollars.
Basically, you get the feeling that no matter how hard you try, you will inevitably break something.
That’s far from the case, says Mohammed Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of a local travel agency, in an attempt to change my mind.
The particularly absurd laws only exist on paper, and over the past twenty years, I haven’t seen anyone be charged for breaking them.
Then why do they remain in place?
So that citizens don’t become complacent.
Compliance with the fundamental rules is rigorously monitored.
For example, if a minor is sold cigarettes at a kiosk, then everyone down the line will be punished: the storeowner will pay a huge fine, the actual offender will receive a caning to their “backside”, and the salesperson will also be given a thrashing and put in jail.
It is thanks to such harsh laws that crime is very rare in Singapore.
Is it justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads: motorists ignored traffic lights, drove however they wanted, and got behind the wheel drunk.
After the introduction of fines, everything calmed down within a year.
Nowadays, a driver, having drunk a jigger of whiskey, knows that if they are pulled over, the police officer won’t let them go for a bribe; they will impose a fine in an amount equivalent to the cost of an apartment and will put them behind bars for years.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a type of detention camp.
In 1993, the American writer, William Gibson, dubbed Singapore, “Disneyland with the death penalty”: the visitor from the United States was terrified by the universal wealth of residents, the “frighteningly clean airport”, and the “cultivated nature”.
He purported that such things are unnatural, appear artificial, and that, as a matter of principle, just shouldn’t be.
The first few days in Singapore, you truly fear tossing a piece of paper onto the sidewalk, and change your mind if you’ve entered the metro with ice cream.
But then you arrive in the “Little India” district and, suddenly, “the mold is broken”: plastic cups lay strewn across a bus stop.
“But how can it be?” you ask in astonishment.
“It just is”, Singaporeans say with a smile.
Anything can happen.
They don’t nab you on the spot for every such “crime”; however, you should know that if they track you down, you won’t be able to talk your way out of it, after all, you broke the law.
More often than not, this is enough to ensure that a person behaves properly.
It goes without saying that the government in Singapore is pretty much authoritarian.
But, you know what?
I walked around in Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City very cautiously: motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras right out of tourists’ hands.
The center of Paris is full of dirty transients and panhandlers.
Not everyone tries to throw their garbage into the cans on our streets either.
Singapore, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless laws (right up to the death penalty), has become the calmest, cleanest, and safest city in the world.
It makes you think.
It’s just human nature: remember, no one buckled-up behind the wheel in Russia either, until they started to issue fines.
Nevertheless, the most important thing in Singapore isn’t the fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And chances are that people here, in Russia, would also be delighted with clean streets, an absence of litter in the metro, and would support the arrest of those who mistake the elevator for a public toilet.
As far as corporal punishment goes: thanks, but no thanks.
As for the rest of Singapore’s laws, at the very least, it’s worth taking a closer look at them.
Is nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.
In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.
But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.
As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.
The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.
Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.
The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.
She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.
Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.
Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.
Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team
UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.
"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.
"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.
And the guy on the corner street, too.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.
"Eilidh is slightly modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.
Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.
As for my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.
So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
He chafed at the criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.
"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.
But it matters.
And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.
He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.
The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.
"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.
Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.
He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf in.
The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."
Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.
I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.
I'm happy with how it's going so far."
Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free of charge, with car parking charged at £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Peculiar tunnels above the freeway, capable of absorbing the carbon monoxide emitted by automobiles, are already being tested on the roads in Great Britain.
The country’s transportation agency, as the Autocar publication reports, has reported positive results from the trial run of the 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The 6-meter-high tunnel was built from some of the latest polymer materials, which are capable of absorbing the harmful substances contained in automobile exhaust.
However, establishing an entire network of similar tunnels is just a part of the extensive measures that the government of Great Britain is planning to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to a network of tunnels, the English plan to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a series of measures to reduce the flow of traffic on roads, expand the use of electric-powered commercial vehicles, and modernize the stock of heavy-duty trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is due to traffic, and poor air quality accounts for up to 40,000 premature deaths each year.
The Moscow City Court has changed the sentence for the disabled Mamayev to a fine
The Moscow City Court has changed the sentence for the disabled man, Aton Mamayev, sentenced to four and a half years in a penal colony, to a fine in the amount of 200,000 rubles.
TASS reports about this.
Previously, the prosecutor’s office asked the court to change the prison term to a suspended sentence, explaining its request by the fact that Mamayev’s illness “prevents him from being in prison conditions.”
28-year-old Anton Mamayev was sentenced to four and a half years imprisonment, to be served in a standard regime penal colony, for a robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces soldier.
On July 19, the court released the man from custody at an off-site session in the pretrial detention facility.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.
An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.
There is no public transport.
The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.
According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people struggle to compete.
"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.
The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.
As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.
"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."
The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.
The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.
Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.
One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.
"I have been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never reappear.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds the discontent.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.
What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically backed the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.
"What else could we do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.
It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.
Growth in the flow of tourists in Ida-Virumaa in June turned out to be minimal
According to the figures, which a correspondent for the rus.err.ee website received from the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, at total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists made use of the services of hotel facilities in the North-East, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than for the same period a year ago.
Moreover, the number of local tourists declined, while the number of foreign tourists grew.
Thus, in June, the flow of foreign tourists increased by 7.3% (544 people) to 7,994 tourists.
Meanwhile, the number of local tourists declined by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
Most notably, the number of Russian tourists in the region increased by 8.9% or by 318 people as compared to June 2016.
In June 2017 alone, 3,885 visitors from Russia spent the night in the hotels of Ida-Virumaa.
Andrey Malakhov has indicated to fans who is to blame for his departure
Andrey Malakhov dropped a hint for his fans on Instagram about who is to blame for his departure from First Channel.
Until now, he hasn’t commented on the rumors, but today he posted an excerpt from an article in the newspaper Vedomosti from August 1.
Malakhov captioned the picture with the tag: “baby boss”.
The article was about how to prevent employee “burnout” and pay attention to their state of being.
If we recall the numerous reports about the host not being able to find common ground with the recently arrived producer, who set out to reformat “Let Them Talk”, it becomes clear what he was dropping such strong hints about, KP writes.
It has been reported that television host Andrey Malakhov is currently on leave and hasn’t signed a letter of resignation from First Channel.
The situation surrounding the termination could become clear in the coming days.
Five soldiers were killed by a car bomb in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers were killed in a bombing in the Afghan province of Helmand, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the police, the other night a car bomb exploded near a military checkpoint in Girishk District.
We are aware of 20 fatalities.
A new incident occurred in Girishk on Friday morning.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange office.
The shootout between the attackers and security forces continues.
A diver has recorded a video of a shark biting his camera
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured on video a shark that bit his GoPro action camera.
The clip was posted to Facebook by a division of the American Agency for Marine Fisheries in the state of Massachusetts, of which Skomal is an employee.
The incident occurred on August 2, off the coast of the Cape Cod peninsula in the northeast of the United States, the Necn website clarifies.
During the dive, the man tried to record the shark on camera, which was attached to a special stick.
Having noticed the human, the animal, with a length of more than three meters, swam up to him.
The shark proceeded to bite the camera, but didn’t try to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator acted in this way to determine if the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could have easily destroyed the device.
He also noted that this type of behavior in marine animals was something new to scientists.
The cause of a massive fight at the Ural Military Center has been revealed
A work group of senior officers from the Central Military District has arrived at the Yelansky Training Center, where a massive fight occurred, in order to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details about this brawl have been revealed already.
According to the Mash public page, which appeared on the VKontakte site, contract soldiers from Ural Military Unit No. 31612 got into a brutal fight over an untucked bed.
It all started when a soldier by the name of Sayan deliberately ignored an officer’s order to tuck in a protruding bed sheet.
Soldiers from the sixth company sided with the officer.
The first company supported Sayan.
In the span of a half hour, the 140 young men trashed the beds and sinks in the barracks and smashed glass.
More than ten people were injured in the massive fight.
The Central Military District refuted information about a stabbing.
More than 1 in 5 US travellers carry prohibited items onto aircraft, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.
The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.
As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions
One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.
At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.
"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."
The Congress of the IAAF has extended the suspension of the All-Russia Athletic Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russia Athletic Federation (ARAF).
As such, the congress supported the IAAF Council (which released a report on Monday that recommended keeping the suspension in place) concerning the reinstatement of the ARAF.
166 people voted to extend the suspension, with 21 against, TASS reports.
The IAAF Council report mentions that the ARAF has made significant progress in achieving the conditions set by the council for reinstating membership, but that these conditions still have not been entirely met.
On account of the ban against the ARAF, Russian track and field athletes were forced to compete at the World Championships in London under a neutral flag.
The team consisted of 19 people who were cleared for competition by the IAAF.
The ARAF was subjected to an indefinite ban from the IAAF in 2015.
At that time, a report was published by Dick Pound, an independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which spoke about numerous violations of WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For more on the latest IAAF Council report, read the Kommersant article: “The IAAF has extended sanctions against the ARAF”.
A bitter defeat
Khimik Novomoskovsk played an away game against FC Kaluga as part of the 3rd round of the FONBET Russian Championship between teams of the Premier Football League.
A little more than 10 days ago, the rivals played against each other in the Russia Cup, this time, however, the look of the game was decidedly different.
Khimik was in no way inferior to its opponent, but a moment of inattentiveness at the end of the match led to the bitter goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat at the hands of the Kalugans, with a score of 0-3, many predicted in advance an easy win for the home team.
However, from the start of the game, the Novomoskovsk players were a force to be reckoned with and played a defensive game, but from a position of strength.
In the 1st half, the Kalugans were more active and had the advantage in terms of possession of the ball.
Aleksei Sirotin, who deflected several dangerous shots and gave his teammates confidence with his performance, had another very good match.
Unfortunately, Khimik’s offensive game didn’t have enough force and luck to stymie Kaluga’s defense and score the first goal of the away game.
After the half time interval, the game turned into an offensive slugfest.
The Novomoskovsk players started playing more actively on the attack.
The death knell for our team turned out to be defensive mistakes that enabled the Kalugans to make a series of critical plays.
Just 10 minutes before the end of the match, Khimik regained territorial advantage and conducted several risky attacks.
But the experience of the Kalugans played its role: they finished off the last minutes with more skill and composure, waiting for their chance to score.
Following a dangerous attack, Khimik moved the ball to corner area, which the home team kicked into the net without opposition.
Yury Dubrovin was the goal scorer.
In the current match, Khimik played a pretty good game, but suffered a bitter defeat.
There is still another away game coming up for our team: on August 11 at 7 p.m. in Moscow at the Eduard Streltsov “Torpedo” Stadium, the Novomoskovsk players will take on the favorites of the Center Group, FC Ararat, whose lineup includes, Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Aleksei Rebko.
Come out and support Khimik!
The time and meeting place for Novomoskovsk fans is 6:30 p.m. outside of the Magnolia store (2 Vostochnaya, Building.
The Khimik lineup: Sirotin, Manokhin (c), Romaschenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogiya (Oreshkin), Dudayti, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoyevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)

Trump pressured Mexico on border wall payment according to leaked phone call transcripts
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
On 27th January in a phone call to Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him "You cannot say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call all day."
The bodies of the tourists who died in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Saint Petersburg
The plane belonging to Rossiya airline company, on board of which are the bodies of the Russian nationals who died in Abkhazia, took off from Sochi en route to Saint Petersburg at 8:15 p.m. (Moscow Time), TASS reports.
Staff from the funeral agency and representatives from the mayor’s office will meet the flight at its final destination point, said Abkhazia’s deputy minister for resorts and tourism, Astamyr Akhba.
Earlier, representatives for the republic’s EMERCON announced that the government of Abkhazia has taken it upon itself to cover all expenses associated with delivering the bodies back to Russia.
Furthermore, Sukhumi intends to pay the families of the deceased compensation in the amount of 500,000 rubles.
According to Akhba, Abkhazia’s leadership expressed their willingness to pay for the flights and accommodation in the republic for the relatives of the tourists who were killed as a result of the explosions; however, the relatives only sent to the republic the power of attorney for local authorities to act in accordance with established procedure.
On August 2, at approximately 4:20 p.m. (Moscow Time), two explosions went off at a missile and artillery depot of the republic’s Ministry of Defense in the village of Primorskoye in Gudautsky District, after which the large caliber shells and other munitions stored there started to detonate.
A fire broke out at the depot as a result of this, which triggered the uncontrolled explosions of various types of shells.
Two Russian citizens were killed as a result of the accident, Yelena Polyakova (born in 1970) and Yelena Timofeeva (born in 1962), who were vacationing nearby the hydrosulfuric spring.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying degrees of severity, were sent to the republic’s medical facilities.
Currently, seven people remain in hospital and the rest have been released.
A grand jury will be involved in investigating Russian influence in the US election
The special prosecutor on Russia, Robert Mueller, has convened a grand jury in Washington that will investigate Russia’s influence on the US presidential election in 2016, the Wall Street Journal newspaper and Reuters news agency report.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens that collects evidence of possible criminal offenses and has the right to question witnesses under oath.
The special prosecutor will examine the collected material and will decide if it is sufficient to file charges.
The convening of a grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect testimonial evidence.
One of the topics of inquiry for the panel of jurors, which started working several weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting between the son of then presidential candidate, Donald Trump, with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
Mueller himself already promised to verify the details of this meeting held in June 2016.
They have already been examined by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his team of lawyers.
Previously, Trump Jr. said that he was expecting to get dirt on the headquarters of the Democratic Party’s candidate, Hillary Clinton, but that no such incriminating documents were presented, and the conversation ended up being about adoption.
At the beginning of August, information appeared in some media sources that Trump Jr.’s statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was practically dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House made it clear that the president did not dictate anything, but simply exercised his authority, as any father would do.
The Deputy Mayor of Penza was detained in the workplace
The deputy head of the administration for Penza, Irina Shirshina, was detained for 48 hours at her place of work by order of the Investigative Committee, RIA Novosti reports.
Official announcements from law enforcement agencies concerning this matter haven’t come in yet, but the press service for the Criminal Investigation Department of the Investigative Committee has assured that they will soon follow.
The mayor’s office for Penza has not yet commented on what has happened.
Irina Shirshina is one of five deputy heads of administration for Penza.
She was responsible for issues of city planning and land matters, having held this position since April 2015.
Prior to this, she worked for a long time as the department head of the State Inspectorate for Housing and Construction for Penza Oblast.
Irina Shirshina is raising three minor children, and it is significant to note that, after becoming a mother once again a year ago, she chose not to take maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is neither a spaceport, nor launch vehicles in Mexico.
However, there is a space agency, established in 2010, and a desire to develop their own space program.
And the installation of a bust of Yuri Gagarin: this is a tribute to the first person in space.
Unlike Soviet-era monuments that are being torn down in some countries, monuments to Gagarin, on the contrary, are “spreading across the planet”.
In 2012, a monument was erected in the American city of Houston, near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument was erected on the grounds of the Royal Observatory, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first space flight.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany, in the city of Erfurt, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992, thanks to public protests, and was relocated from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin’s 70th birthday, a monument to Yurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
This is how the given name and surname of the first cosmonaut sound in Latvian, and he looks as though he has reached the age of 70.
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.
"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.
"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.
But not one was ever prosecuted.
Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.
Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.
Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.
"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks put it more succinctly.
"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.
Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.
"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said n---a, get off my property!"
Rascona fires back.
There's a beat.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
He's alarmed, confused.
Did I go too hard?
"No," Greene said through chuckles.
"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"
"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.
"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"
And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.
Absolutely no one laughs.
The reenactment ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks on every other word.
A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.
They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted.
As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.
Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.
"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.
He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.
"The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment," he said.
"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.
Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
A court has fined Navalny for violations at a “campaign subbotnik”
Moscow’s Simonovsky Court has fined Alexei Navalny 300,000 rubles for violating the procedure for organizing a rally.
The opposition figure was found guilty of committing an administrative offence specified in part 8 of Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation, “Repeat violation of the procedure for organizing a rally”.
Earlier, the judge for Moscow’s Simonovsky Court, Khizir Mussakaev, finished hearing the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, head of the main office for the opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, who was held liable under the very same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine in the amount of 300,000 rubles.
This is the amount that Judge Mussakaev assessed for the distribution of leaflets at a “campaign subbotnik” that Navalny’s supporters held in Moscow on July 8-9.
Having seen the propaganda materials, the police officers monitoring participants at the “campaign subbotnik” believed that the organizers had deliberately concealed its real purpose: a public protest (which requires advance permission from the capital’s authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers, Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev, petitioned for a termination of the administrative proceedings, due to an absence of concrete evidence of an offense, and pointed to the fact that the police made specific mistakes when preparing the report.
Volkov wasn’t detained at the actual “campaign subbotnik”, but he received a summons obliging him to appear at the police station to give a statement about the event, which was held with his active participation.
Navalny himself and another colleague of the opposition figure, Nikolai Lyaskin, also received summons.
In Mordovia, a man who shot a bride and three wedding guests has been arrested
A court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people at a wedding, including the bride.
The republic’s directorate of the Investigative Committee reported this.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During a dispute, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk fired several shots at the event’s guests, who had gone to the village pond to swim.
Three women and one man were wounded as a result.
Criminal charges have been filed under paragraph “a” of part 1 of Article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Hooliganism), part 3 of Article 30, and paragraphs “a”, “f”, and “i” of part 2 of Article 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Attempted murder of two or more persons, committed using a generally dangerous method, based on malicious motives).
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man started shooting because the wedding guests, having decided to go swimming, walked through his territory on their way to the pond.
The Ministry of Energy will tighten requirements for suppliers of turbines for electric power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for reporting information for suppliers of critically important equipment, in particular, turbines for electric power plants.
When launching gas turbines, turbines for hydroelectric plants, and oil pumping and extraction facilities, equipment suppliers will be obligated to share information about access to them with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technology and Export Control.
The government draft decree is already ready and has been submitted for public consultation.
The new requirements will only apply to “critically important energy equipment” delivered to Russia.
Potential threats named in the document include incidents such as foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unprincipled partners, and hackers gaining information about and access to control over facilities.
The European Union has expanded anti-Russian sanctions on account of Siemens
On August 4, the European Union’s press service announced that anti-Russian sanctions had been expanded because of a scandal surrounding the delivery of turbines manufactured by Siemens to Crimea.
Argumenty Nedeli previously reported on this.
The press service of the EU Council announced that sanctions against Russia were expanded because of a scandal over turbines manufactured by Siemens, which were allegedly delivered to Crimea in contravention of the sanctions.
Today, the European Council is considering all possible complaints and suggestions by member states concerning the expansion of anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier, it was reported that a final decision would be made by the end of the day, and a decision has been made: sanctions against Russia have been expanded.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business.
The job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394-million U.S.) in May in a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the year was unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.05 billion pounds.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.
On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."
The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.
But the efforts have triggered pushback by Democratics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.
The Association of European Businesses has come out against the new anti-Russian sanctions
The Association of European Businesses has expressed its opposition to the United States’ economic sanctions against Russia.
In the opinion of the AEB, such measures could lead to a serious decline in production and a loss of jobs.
The announcement from the AEB states that business is one of the most important links connecting countries and peoples, and it is for this reason that the principles of free trade must not be restricted.
The Association of European Businesses unites more than 500 companies from European Union countries and the European Free Trade Association.
The association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, US, and Russia to develop a new course of action, which would make it possible to separate business from politics and find collective and mutually acceptable solutions in the spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies are asking the police to restrict traffic on the waterfront in Pskov
The chosen representatives of the people in Pskov issued a request to the chief of the city’s regional office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Sergei Surin, regarding the issue of traffic along the waterfront of the Velikaya River.
City duma deputies, Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Storonenkov, and Valery Lesnikov, believe that motorists hinder people from taking walks and relaxing in this area.
In their view, monitoring drivers will help make this area more peaceful and safe.
The issue is that offenders are ignoring “pedestrian crossing” signs and driving around the waterfront without restriction.
It turns out that extensive repairs and improvements were carried out in vain.
The sports areas and playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable due to the cars.
As the Pskov Information Agency notes, members of the Patrol and Checkpoint Service and neighborhood watch volunteers are patrolling the central waterfront in the evenings.
Thanks to them, the number of vehicles passing through is declining, but not all the traffic is going away.
Putin has demanded investigative agencies not to seize hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed prohibiting investigative agencies from seizing servers and hard drives from work computers within businesses.
The head of state announced this at a meeting about the investment development program for the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to “eliminate the use of investigative measures that result in business interruption, including the seizure of hard drives from work computers and servers”.
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, “it is sufficient to make copies, authenticate them, and use them during the course of the investigation”.
The head of state added that one must not “create conditions that prevent an enterprise from continuing its activities, to the extent of not being able to pay taxes”.
Olga Buzova spoke about how badly she wanted to call her ex-husband
Television host Olga Buzova admitted that she really wanted to call her ex-husband, the football player Dmitri Tarasov.
Currently, the celebrity is in the United States, where he is dealing with work issues.
Just the other day, Olga visited Las Vegas, after which she decided to publish a post on the social media platform, Instagram.
She stated that she hadn’t gotten married, hadn’t gotten any new tattoos, and also hadn’t repeatedly called her ex-spouse to tell him that he had ruined her life, even though she had really wanted to do this.
Buzova stated that she would remember this trip forever, since she had had such a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy has died
The British actor, Robert Hardy, who played Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge in the film adaptation of the series of novels about Harry Potter, has passed away in his 92nd year of life.
The Independent newspaper reported this on Thursday.
His relatives spoke about his death.
In their words, he lived “a tremendous life, achieving success in film, theater, and television over a 70-year career”.
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, he acted alongside Laurence Olivier on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in “The Tragedy of Coriolanus”.
Hardy is also remembered for his multiple performances as Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the film adaptations of Agatha Christie’s works about Miss Marple.
He was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for his performance in the same role of Churchill in the BBC television drama series, “Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years” (1981).
Robert Hardy also had the chance to play the role of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on more than one occasion.
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark: Prince Henrik, or in actual fact, Henri Marie Jean André Graf of Laborde, has refused to be buried together with his crowned spouse, Queen Margrethe.
This year is the couple’s “golden” wedding anniversary; however, the order of the day isn’t preparations for the celebration, but rather a grave dispute.
His Highness renounced the title of Prince Consort, and also made stinging remarks in the queen’s address about her never getting around to granting him the title of King Consort.
Henrik lives in France even though he remains the queen’s official spouse.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has urged Washington to stop defaming Moscow
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has addressed the statements of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Balkans.
The foreign ministry circulated the corresponding statement a short while ago.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out in its commentary that the United States is ever more actively making use of Cold War clichés, which are totally out of touch with the current reality.
Moreover, Russian diplomats urged the American authorities to stop defaming the Russian Federation.
As Argumenty Nedeli wrote the other day, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the western Balkans and organizing an unsuccessful coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
Best of luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.
"We're the main names.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ... ."
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.
But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.
They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.
"This is the fight to be made.
No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.
I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.
Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Several central roads in Moscow will be closed to traffic over the weekend
This weekend, August 5 and 6, traffic in the capital will be restricted in the area of Tverskaya Street between Nastasinsky Lane and Triumphal Square; traffic will also be restricted along 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.
In addition to this, Leningradsky Prospekt will be closed to traffic from the Third Ring Road to 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.

The streets will be closed from midnight on August 5 until 5 a.m. on August 7, in connection with their improvement.
A section of Moskvoretskaya Embankment will also be closed to traffic on the weekend.
Construction of Zaryadye Park is still underway there.
Putin has instructed the Office of the Prosecutor General to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation to conduct an inspection of Baikal territory for evidence of illegal and environmentally destructive activities.
“I am requesting the Office of the Prosecutor General to check Baikal territory for evidence of illegal and environmentally destructive activities”, Vladimir Putin said at a meeting dedicated to environmental development of the region.
Furthermore, the Russian leader asked that measures be taken if evidence of violations is found.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.
Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.
They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.
To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."
When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.
One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.
The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."
I’ll think about whether to run for the presidency
During a working visit to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin stated that he is ready to think about whether to run for the Russian presidency in the 2018 election, Interfax reports.
This statement was in response to a request from a resident of the village of Cheremushka in Buryatia.
During a videoconference dedicated to fighting the fires in Buryatia and Irkutsk Oblast, the interlocutor turned to Putin with the words: “Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request for you; when the next presidential election takes place, we all ask that you run for this position again”.
“Fine, I will think about it, thank you”, the president said in response.
On July 28, the president’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the statements of certain media outlets that the Russian president’s chief of staff, Aton Vaino, would be in charge of Vladimir Putin’s campaign headquarters.
Peskov called these suppositions “groundless, hypothetical speculation”.
“So far there is no headquarters: it will be quite some time before a headquarters is established and the election campaign is still a long way off”, Peskov said.
“It’s not on the agenda yet”, Peskov stated.
West Virginia governor announces he's switching parties
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.
"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to run another play."
Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
A heavyweight cat that goes by the nickname of Mr. Handsome has found a home thanks to social media
A shelter in the city of Pittsboro (North Carolina, United States) has placed a cat by the name of Mr. Handsome, weighing more than 14 kilograms, after he became famous thanks to the internet.
Mashable reports about this.
At the end of June, a picture of the cat, with a request to find his owner, was published on the shelter’s Facebook account, because “it’s clear someone used to feed him”.
In the comments, users noted that the expression on the animal’s face could become a new meme.
The post garnered more than 3,200 likes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to take in Mr. Handsome.
In the end, he was placed in the care of Angela Frazee, who promised to deal with his excess weight.
In an interview with WNCN radio station, the American woman said that she already had a similar experience: she brought home a cat weighing 10 kilograms and now he weighs just a little more than five.
In July, Reddit users took notice of a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
The post with a picture of the animal garnered more than 68,000 views.
Commentators noted that she could very well make a career for herself in the modeling business.
Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.
A court has placed a Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason under arrest
Journalist Vasily Muravitsky, detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), has been placed under arrest for two months, the SBU reports.
The employee of the online media outlet, Zhitomir Journal, is suspected of treason on the basis of posting his publications on Russian websites and of violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
That being said, Russia does not support the actions of Ukrainian authorities in relation to the journalist, considering it a “barbaric policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy has decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
The Comandante Borsini patrol ship entered Libya’s territorial waters so as to then stop the flow of illegal migrants in cooperation with that country’s navy.
The decision to start the operation was approved by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome obtained approval for it from the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, it must be said, is not in control of a large part of the country’s territory.
The Libyan parliament based in Tobruk, which is in opposition to the cabinet, accused Italy of violating Libya’s sovereignty.
While the commander-in-chief of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to repel the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, it was announced that they do not believe these threats and intend to deploy yet another naval vessel to Libya’s territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week during negotiations between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and Fayez al-Sarraj, head of the Cabinet of Libya, which is recognized by Europe.
Italian authorities settled on establishing a naval mission to combat illegal migration in July, when statistics for the number of illegals who have sailed to the country from Libya were made public: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The government announced that resources for the settlement of migrants have been depleted.
A major glitch has occurred with Skype
Today, a worldwide glitch in Skype service was recorded at the same time in several countries.
On Thursday, August 3, users started to send complaints en masse to the program developers.
Microsoft stressed that experts are already actively working to fix the problems that residents of Europe and North America were facing, clarifies RIA Novosti.
You will recall that, in June of this year, a glitch also occurred with Skype.
For a period of time, users were unable to receive or send messages.
Two Team Ukraine leaders in track and field were suspended from participating in the World Championships
Olga Zemlyak and Olesia Povkh, who specialize in sprinting, were excluded from the Team Ukraine roster for the 2017 World Championships in London.
This is reported on the website of the country’s athletics federation (UAF).
This decision was made by the organization’s executive committee in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the track athletes by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
Zemlyak’s coach, Sergey Basenko, was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation’s roster.
As Sportarena reports, the IAAF suspects the female athletes of doping.
Povkh was a bronze medalist at the 2012 Olympics, world champion in 2011, and European champion in 2010 in the 4x100m relay; Zemlyak won the 2012 European championship in the 4x400m relay.
The World Championships in Athletics in London will be held from August 4-13.
How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.
Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.
Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."
The president will determine the procedure and location of the oath-taking ceremony
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the president: the State Duma Committee on State-Building and Legislation has prepared such amendments to the second reading of the corresponding law.
Just a week ago, deputies were planning to directly determine the procedure for the oath-swearing ceremony in the law.
Children under the age of 18, as well as the legally incapacitated, will be exempt from taking the solemn oath, it appears from a revised text of amendments to the proposed law “On Citizenship of the Russian Federation” (Izvestia has a copy at its disposal), which the committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on July 11.
President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of establishing an oath of allegiance when becoming a citizen of the Russian Federation, in lieu of the formal signing of documents, during a meeting with State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin on June 6.
Deputies put this idea into action through amendments to the second reading of the bill, which provides for the reversal of a decision to grant citizenship to those who are later convicted of a range of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for publicly calling for terrorist activity or for publicly justifying them in the media or on the internet (part 2 of Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for high-jacking an aircraft, train, or waterborne vessel, but only in the event this act is related to terrorism (part 4 of Article 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, the logic was as follows: when filling out citizenship forms, a person signs a promise to comply with Russian laws, and by going down an extremist path, they are breaking that promise.
The bill was introduced in the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions, Vladimir Vasilyev (United Russia), Gennady Zyuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhironovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov (A Just Russia), and by the speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, deputies approved it in its first reading.
The following week, the State Duma Committee on State-Building and Legislation approved the text of the bill for its second reading; however, it has now been revised once again.
Currently, it reads that the president will determine the procedure of the oath-taking ceremony.
Previously, parliamentarians were going to define the procedures for the law “On Citizenship of the Russian Federation” themselves, specifying that the ceremony should take place in a solemn atmosphere, in front of the state emblem and the Russian flag, and in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was unclear from the text of the bill where this ceremony should take place: there is list of places where it is possible to place the emblem of the Russian Federation, which is regulated according to federal constitutional law.
Included on this list are: courthouses, the offices of heads of state bodies for the constituent entities and municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal agencies of executive authority, and so forth.
In all likelihood, it could even be the civil registry offices.
Those wishing to receive Russian citizenship will swear the solemn oath after officials examine their documents.
However, it appears from the revised text that an individual will only receive a Russian passport after they have taken the oath.
A week ago, the draft mentioned that the oath must precede the signing of the decree.
In the updated text, it mentions that swearing allegiance to Russia will be for those 18 years of age and older, rather than starting at 14 years of age.
The rule, according to which the legally incapacitated or partially incapacitated, as well as those who are unable to say, read, or independently sign the text of the oath, are exempt from taking the oath, was retained.
Additionally, the Russian president has the right to exempt “other persons” from this procedure.
The updated bill also spells out the specific procedure for granting Russian citizenship to residents of Ukraine who are regarded as native speakers of Russian.
They will have to officially renounce their Ukrainian citizenship by presenting the relevant application form for this to the authorized Ukrainian authority.
A notarized copy of the application form will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
A renouncement of “foreign” citizenship, as is the case right now, is not required if it is provided for by international agreement or if it is not possible “due to factors beyond the control of the individual”.
The respective amendment to the law was suggested by a group of deputies, including First Vice-Speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov, and Ayrat Farrakhov (all from United Russia).
I think that many of us know that getting an official document from Ukraine is unrealistic and just not possible.
As such, a whole lot of people are awaiting a decision on their fate in terms of Russian citizenship, the head of the Duma Committee on State-Building and Legislation, Pavel Krasheninnikov (UR), explained the other day.
In addition to this, a clarification appeared in the text stating that the restriction on foreigners holding certain positions will not apply to those who have renounced their “other” citizenship in writing and have surrendered their previous passport to the Russian Ministry of the Interior, but have not ceased being a citizen of another country “due to factors beyond their control”.
Currently, foreigners are prohibited from holding a position in the municipal service or being employed at facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to ensuring Russia’s security.
Furthermore, a person with dual citizenship or permanent residency in another country cannot become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is anticipated that the law should enter into force on September 1, 2017, and the requisite subordinate regulatory acts must be ready by that time.
Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.
But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.
It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.
It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).
And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.
The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.
The prize money for the Russian Football Super Cup match between Spartak and Lokomotiv will amount to about 30 million rubles.
The president of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL), Sergey Pryadkin, announced this at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, RT reports.
He also added that, by now, there are hardly any tickets left for the match.
The Spartak-Lokomotiv match will take place on Friday, July 14 at 9:30 p.m.
As noted by TASS, Spartak is the current Russian champion, while Lokomotiv holds the country’s Cup title.
Two young residents of Ufa fleeced a furniture workshop of 200,000 rubles
The other day, a 37-year-old resident of Ufa, who owns a furniture business, contacted the police.
The man reported the theft of expensive tools from the workshop, which dealt a serious blow to his business.
The young thieves’ loot consisted of tools worth a total of almost 200,000 rubles: two welding units, a perforating machine, a hydraulic system, and a lift.
Law enforcement officers set out in search of the criminals and, shortly thereafter, found the residents of Bashkortostan’s Blagoveshchensky District: 23-year-old and 24-year-old buddies.
According to the press service for the republic’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, the criminal associates entered the grounds of the business, forced open the front door, and carried out the tools.
Immediately after this, the young men sold the stolen equipment to the first available auto service center.
A criminal case for theft has already been initiated against them, while law enforcement officers were able to return just some of the stolen tools to their rightful owner.
The State Department has commented on Medvedev’s remarks on Russia-US relations
The United States and Russia should be able to work with each other.
Such a statement was delivered by the State Department’s official spokesperson, Heather Nauert, in response to the remarks of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the relations of the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government stated that, by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had put an end to hopes for an improvement in bilateral relations and had declared a full-fledged trade war against Russia.
Commenting on these remarks, Nauert admitted that Russian-American relations are at a “low point”, however, she noted that it was necessary to look for “areas for cooperation”.
“Take a look at the ceasefire in southwest Syria, which has held firm for almost a month already”.
“This is an example of good US-Russian cooperation”, RIA Novosti quotes the diplomat as saying.
That being said, the spokesperson for the foreign policy establishment declined to comment on the Russian prime minister’s statement equating the sanctions to a trade war.
A bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and the DPRK, was signed by US President Donald Trump this past Wednesday.
However, he acknowledged that the document was flawed and contradicted the American Constitution.
Dior has “grown” roses made of amethysts and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior – Dior Joaillerie – has added to the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
Five new rings and three choker necklaces on velvet ribbons have been added to them.
Two new rings and a pendant made from amethysts, rose quartz, and diamonds, created using glyptic (engraving of gemstones by hand) and pavé setting techniques, were released in the Rose Dior Pré Catelan line to mark the house’s 70th anniversary.
The head of Dior Joaillerie, Victoire de Castellane, was inspired by the roses that fashion designer Christian Dior grew at his estate in Granville and by the Bagatelle and Pré-Catelan gardens in Paris.
Trump has found the culprits behind deteriorating relations with Russia
US President Donald Trump lashed out at members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to the deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an all-time low and dangerous level.
“You can thank Congress: the same people that can’t even give us healthcare”, the president wrote on Twitter.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and the DPRK.
They, in particular, affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House released a statement by the president, in which he pointed out that the law would prevent the US from concluding lucrative deals and would bring Russia, China, and North Korea even closer together.
A Belorussian entrepreneur has backed out of buying Sberbank’s Ukrainian subsidiary
An entrepreneur from Belarus, Viktor Prokopenya, has withdrawn a bid from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to purchase a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBK as an intention “to concentrate on our other planned investments and projects we are working on”.
According to Mr. Prokopenya, this move will be “the best investment of time”, despite the investment attractiveness of the Sberbank subsidiary acquisition.
Mr. Prokopenya became the prime contender for the buy-out of the division of the Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU declined a consortium bid by Grigory Guselnikov’s NorvikBank and Said Gutseriev’s Belorussian company in July.
Russian banks started to abandon the Ukrainian market after the country’s president, Petro Poroshenko, introduced sanctions against their subsidiary structures in March.
One of these financial organizations, in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank, was Sberbank.
Novak has identified the cause of the blackout in Crimea
The Russian Ministry of Energy has identified the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the government agency, Alexander Novak, offered clarification concerning the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity as a result of a traffic accident in Krasnodar Krai.
A truck involved in the accident hit power lines, which led to an outage of the Kuban and connected Crimean power grids.
Power failures were reported in major cities in Crimea last week.
Technicians fixed the problems over the course of a few hours.
At first, it was reported that the cause of the blackout could have been a heat wave.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.
The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.
It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.
In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.
Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.
It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.
The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.
The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000
Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.
Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.
Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.
The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
The World Congress of Tatars has adopted a resolution to support the treaty between Tatarstan and Russia
The sixth congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT) has adopted a resolution that notes the importance of retaining the post of the president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post “has proven to be a positive form for organizing the highest state authority in the republic and expressing the national interests of all Tatar people”.
Furthermore, the congress emphasized the importance of the power-sharing treaty between Russia and Tatarstan in the resolution.
According to the document, it “has played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic, and socio-political development of both Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
To recap, the treaty between Moscow and Kazan, in force since July 24, 2007, was signed for a period of 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan approached the president of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and retain the name of the position of the head of the region.
Currently, Tatarstan is the only constituent entity of the federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only post that goes by the name of “president”.
Difficulties have arisen with obtaining international driving permits in Russia
State Traffic Safety Inspectorate departments are experiencing a shortage of international driving permits (IDP).
To get such permits, one must wait their turn for several weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers wishing to go on holiday abroad using their car or rent one there.
It’s worth mentioning that the situation with international driving permits remains contradictory.
The IDP was introduced so that it would be easier for foreign police to understand what is written in the national permit, since the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international driving permits are written in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian permits are recognized already.
However, in actual fact, everything depends on specific police officers or the rental agency: some require the IDP, while a national permit is enough for others.
To be on the safe side, drivers still get international permits, but it should be kept in mind that in countries that haven’t ratified the convention, for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, and Indonesia, the authorities have the right to refuse both national permits and the IDP.
Currently, there is a problem with the forms at almost every department of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate, Kommersant reports, after conducting an investigation in several regions.
For example, at departments of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate in Moscow, they have simply stopped handing out tickets and there has been a shortage of forms for four months already.
It’s possible to register for an appointment on the state services website, but the waitlist on there already extends into the middle of August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get the IDP “due to technical reasons”, without going into details; in Samara Oblast, to be honest, there are no forms, and it’s a similar situation in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already been faced with this issue; messages like this are popping up with increasing frequency on social media:
Irina Burmistrova: “Take a guess, why you can’t get an international permit in Moscow?”
That’s right, because all of the departments of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate have run out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: “A question for people in the know!”
I need to get an international permit as soon as possible.
In Moscow, everything is always booked up so far in advance, and they aren’t issuing tickets on-site (there is a button, but it can’t issue a ticket).
Apparently, the state service website shows that there are lots of appointments available in Saint Petersburg.
Has anyone tried to get one in a different city?
Do you think it will work?
The Russian Ministry of the Interior explained that the requirements for the international driving permit forms have changed, and that the delivery of new forms to departments of the State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate is currently underway.
This might be related to the shortage, however, it’s unclear what changes they are talking about, since nothing was announced previously.
The forms are purchased by the Special Designation Center for Traffic Safety (SDCTS) of the Russian Ministry of the Interior, and then they are distributed to departments of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate.
Over the past few years, all contracts were signed with JSC Goznak: between 2014-2015, almost 200,000 IDP forms were produced; in 2016, 15,000 forms were purchased; in 2017 – 90,000; but, the most recent contract was signed on July 18 with OOO First Print Yard to produce 70,000 forms.
One explanation is that the SDC didn’t hold the tender in time, which resulted in the shortage.
However, there are also other explanations for the scarcity of forms: on account of the crisis, people, of their own volition, have started to travel not to Europe, but to less expensive Asian countries like China, Thailand, and so on.
It is still unclear what types of permits are accepted there, so people are covering all their bases, and that is why there has been overwhelming demand for the international “papers”.
Recently, it came to light that professional drivers will have to pass a test to verify their skills.
The Ministry of Transport came up with this proposal.
The new version of the international driver’s permit (IDP) has been in use since May 31, 2011.
Ukraine’s Minister of Justice refused to believe in the construction of the Crimea Bridge
Ukraine’s Minister of Justice, Pavel Petrenko, stated that he doesn’t believe in Russia’s ability to build a bridge to Crimea.
He said this on Friday, August 4, in an interview on the Obozrevatel website.
Not a single self-respecting international company would put even a tiny bolt or nut in there, because they would risk losing their business in the EU, USA, Japan – the countries that joined in sanctions against Russia in relation to Crimea.
“In other words, it is my profound belief that this project essentially has no future”, Petrenko declared.
He added that he believes Russia is incapable of implementing the large-scale infrastructure project on its own.
Russia can’t even properly build smaller-scale projects.
I know that, following the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums were already starting to crumble.
“Therefore, I consider the best instrument in this situation to be sanctions against companies who turned out to be shortsighted enough to join this project”, the official noted.
On July 31, construction workers finished installing the vehicle arch of the Crimea Bridge.
On the Kerch shore, preassembly of the road transport arch of the Crimea Bridge has been completed: its arch is capped at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
“At the same time, bridge builders prepared to install the fairway supports for the railway arch”, the project’s information center reported.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that construction on the project was ahead of schedule.
The Crimea Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and Krasnodar Krai.
An official who didn’t go to work for 10 years was fired in Spain
What kind of angelic patience (or utter indifference to public service) did the boss of the Spanish official, Carlos Recio, have to possess?
The permanent absence spanned a long 10 years.
Admittedly, Mr. Recio had been fired after all.
But not by his direct supervisor.
What doesn’t happen in the world of bureaucracy?
Ordinary people, it seems, have long become accustomed to all the antics of the “servants of the people”.
But, nevertheless, officials always manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live quite well.
This time the “sensation” hails from Spain.
There, an employee at the Valencia archives, Carlos Recio, managed to not go to work for an entire ten years.
That being said, he still received his salary regularly.
Moreover, it was entirely respectable: 50,000 euros a year.
And then, the “wonderful times” of Mr. Recio came to an end.
He was fired according to a decision by Valencia’s legislative assembly.
During the course of the investigation, it emerged that the notorious absentee went to the office every workday morning at 7:00 a.m., in order to clock in on the electronic system.
And then, he immediately left for home.
He showed up at the workplace again at 4:00 p.m., in order to once again register in the system that he had left.
And so it continued for 10 years.
It also came to light that the absentee dedicated all his free time to drawing comics at home.
Now, the deputies of Valencia’s legislative assembly are also considering how to punish Mr. Recio’s direct supervisor, who couldn’t have not known how his subordinate was “actively working” at his job.
They’re proposing to protect judges from chairpersons
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC), under instructions from Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch.
The HRC proposes limiting the powers of court chairpersons and introducing appointment by election for them.
For appeal and cassation courts, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative territorial divisions of the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also submit its proposals as part of the presidential mandate.
The HRC has finished developing the proposals, which will make it possible to strengthen the independence of the Russian system of justice.
The HRC conducted this work in accordance with an order by Vladimir Putin from January 3, 2017, which the president issued after a meeting with members of the council.
Individual cases of abuse of judicial power, as well as issues with public oversight of places of imprisonment, were discussed at the meeting with council members on December 8, 2016 (see Kommersant from December 9).
The work of the HRC resulted in 25 proposals, which are concerned both with issues of ensuring judicial independence and uncovering miscarriages of justice, as well as with funding for courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders involves limiting the powers of court chairpersons to increase the independence of the other judges.
If a judicial candidate has successfully completed the selection process and has received the support of the community of judges, then the court chairperson, in the opinion of the HRC, ought to submit their nomination without having the right to refuse, as the law currently allows.
It is also proposed to strip the court chairperson of the right to divide a case under consideration between judges.
Experts suggest that a specially written computer program can do this.
The HRC also believes that the court chairperson shouldn’t have the right “to predetermine the results of a judge’s performance report, initiate disciplinary actions against them, or make decisions about the establishment of additional monetary payments”.
In addition to this, the presidential council considers it essential to move to “the election of court chairpersons by judges themselves” and “confer their powers for a relatively short term with mandatory rotation”.
Currently, all court chairpersons (from the republic courts right down to the district courts) are appointed by the president for six years, upon the recommendation of the chief justice of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to shield judges from pressure by regional administrations, the HRC suggests organizing appeal and cassations courts of general jurisdiction in a new way.
Currently, their structure is tied to the administrative territorial division of the Russian Federation.
The HRC says “it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate appellate and cassation courts that are not on the same level as the regional judicial bodies in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but rather in judicial districts”.
The experts are using the experience of arbitration courts as a model.
They are part of judicial districts that do not correspond to the administrative division of the Russian Federation, and as a result, guarantee significant independence from regional officials, whose ability to use “telephone justice” is constrained.
The HRC proposes strengthening justices of the peace with people’s assessors, so as to examine certain “categories of civil and administrative cases” with their participation.
For example, the termination of parental rights, employment reinstatement, slander suits, the revocation of driver’s licenses, and so forth.
“These are only our proposals”, a member of the HRC and a retired judge for the Constitutional Court, Tamara Morshchakova, explained to Kommersant.
She also reminded that the president’s mandate applied not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (SC), which still has not unveiled its proposals.
The SC (with its coauthors: the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Human Rights Commissioner for the Russian Federation) still has time to fulfill the mandate.
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Vyacheslav Lebedev must present a report to Vladimir Putin, by September 1, on how effectively the independence of the justice system is ensured in the Russian Federation.
Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.
"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."
Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.
It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.
The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.
Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.
What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.
"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.
These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."
It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.
The government has confirmed the establishment of a commission for cultural policy
The Russian government has approved the establishment of a commission on issues of state cultural policy.
A corresponding order was published on the government’s website.
According to the document, the primary objective of the commission will be the preparation and revision of strategic approaches to cultural policy.
The commission will also develop a draft strategy for cultural policy, clarify the mandate, and prepare new programs for its realization.
The deputy chair of the Russian Government has been appointed as head of the commission.
The commission’s membership will be confirmed separately.
In 2016, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved an implementation plan for the strategy of the state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan is comprised of 193 events and provides for measures aimed at expanding the influence of Russian culture in other countries, maintaining a common cultural space and cultural legacy, and it will also encourage the creation of conditions for cultural development in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries has declined to an eight-year low
Growth of consumer prices in countries belonging to the G20 fell to the lowest level in the past eight years, the Wall Street Journal reports with reference to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 were at 2%; lower rates were observed in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decline in Russia’s consumer price index by 0.1%.
As such, the agency recorded the first week-long deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the Ministry of Finance’s calculations, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economic Development, however, is of the opinion that the target value has already been achieved: according to this agency, the figure is 4%.
Putin warns against illegal logging of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against illegal deforestation during a meeting concerning the environmental development of Baikal’s natural territory.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donskoi, noted that a bill had been prepared already.
It permits forest clearing during the course of fire suppression efforts and the government is planning to pass it as early as the fall.
By the same token, the president said that it is necessary to keep an eye on this plan, so that “not everything in sight is cut down” during the clearing process.
Donskoi pointed out that this bill calls for oversight from EMERCON and watchdog agencies.
Media: UAF soldiers are negotiating with Donbass rebels in secret from military command
Regular telephone communication has been established at the line of armed confrontation in Donbass.
Soldiers from the opposing sides are continuously communicating with each other using mobile phones, and headquarters doesn’t know about this communication.
UAF soldiers and Donbass rebels have established communication via mobile phone in secret from their high commands.
Strana.ua reported this on August 4, citing combatants of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication’s information, unit commanders know full well the names of their colleagues from the opposing side of the front and communicate with them daily by telephone.
The communication is anything but ordinary: the commanders are trying to achieve certain “tactical agreements”.
Oftentimes, such conversations result in a truce along specific sections of the front.
Journalists have learned about instances where one officer or another has received birthday greetings across the frontline from his official enemy.
UAF soldiers and DNR and LNR rebels have been sitting in the trenches along the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine began a military operation against Donbass.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was outraged by the blocking of statements by the UN Security Council concerning attacks on the Russian Embassy
Russia’s foreign policy establishment is outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic envoys that are blocking UN Security Council press statements condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported this.
The ministry recalled how, on August 2, the grounds of the Russian Embassy in Damascus were subjected to mortar fire, for the third time in a month, at the hands of the Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (the former al-Nusra Front, banned in Russia) and the Faylaq al-Rahman terrorist groups.
Considering that the international community unanimously classifies al-Nursa as a terrorist organization and that UN Security Council resolutions call for opposition against this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation noted that “one would think that it would be self-evident that acts of terrorism by al-Nusra should be met with universal, unconditional, and resounding condemnation, and that there should be no ambiguity when it comes to assessing attacks against diplomatic missions”.
However, as the diplomatic service underscored, “for the third time in a month already, the diplomatic envoys of the United States, Great Britain, France, and Ukraine in the UN Security Council have taken turns, while varying the tone of their objections under the guise of an alleged absence of necessary information, blocking the Russian Federation’s proposal to issue a standard short draft press statement by the Security Council condemning the terrorist attacks against the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital”.
May the unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us remain on the conscience of those delegations.
“The most disturbing thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to carry out new provocations and terrorist attacks and makes them feel that they can act with impunity”, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, adding that “we wouldn’t want these barbarians to develop the conviction that someone in the Security Council is at one with them”.
Vladimir Putin has come out in favor of limiting the number of unscheduled inspections of businesses
Russian President Vladimir Putin, during a meeting about investment projects in the Far East, stated that the number of unscheduled inspections of business owners should be lowered to 30% of the number of scheduled ones, and he also spoke about the need to cap the time it takes to carry out an inspection at ten days.
“Unscheduled inspections are conducted, as a rule, without appropriate approval from the prosecutor’s office – only 2-3% are approved with the prosecutor’s office – and all the rest are carried out independently”, TASS quotes the president as saying.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators must be prohibited from confiscating servers and hard disks within companies.
Furthermore, in the president’s opinion, business associations should be given the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
“This, I hope, will have a clearly positive impact on the handling of cases related to business activities or related to violations of the law in the field of business”, the head of state said.
As Kommersant reported, as a result of the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of businesses is growing.
In May, a survey, commissioned by Presidential Business Ombudsman Boris Titov, was conducted that revealed that scheduled inspections had essentially been replaced by: unscheduled inspections (the share faced with them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), inspections by the prosecutor’s office (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raids (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as inspections requested by citizens (grew from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative inspections (10.8% to 15.5%).

Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.
Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.
Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.
A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.
Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.
"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.
"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."
On Friday, that hope appeared gone.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.
Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.
Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.
This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.
That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.
No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How'd that work out?
Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.
Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
The Tyumen prosecutor’s office is fighting against an HIV dissident
The prosecutor’s office has challenged the decision of Tyumen’s Kalininsky District Court to drop criminal charges in relation to a local female resident whose young daughter died from HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because her mother is an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court absolved her of responsibility in connection with her reconciliation with the aggrieved father.
The prosecutor’s office believes that the crime cannot go unpunished, so as to not set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against the female resident of Tyumen was initiated under part 1 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (infliction of death by negligence) in April, following the death of her 3-year-old daughter from a stage 4B HIV infection.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the mother is also HIV-positive.
“The woman didn’t get treatment for herself and refused treatment for her daughter, believing that HIV doesn’t exist”, the prosecutor’s office for Tyumen Oblast explained.
The criminal case was brought before the Kalininsky District Court, which made the decision to dismiss it on July 25.
A request for this was filed by the father of the dead girl, explaining that he had “forgiven his wife, holds no claims against her, and that she has made amends and has apologized”.
The prosecutor’s office did not agree with the court’s decision and filed an appeal demanding a reversal of the decision to dismiss the case and that it be sent for a retrial.
The young girl died and making amends for the harm caused by the crime is impossible.
The HIV-positive mother, against the advice of doctors, refused an examination of the little girl and treatment of this dangerous infection for her”, the press service of the prosecutor’s office reported.
In the opinion of the regulatory agency, she should be punished; otherwise, other HIV dissidents will follow her example.
According to the Tyumen AIDS Center, right now in Tyumen Oblast there are around 12 children who are sick with HIV who do not receive medical assistance as a result of their parents’ refusal to consent.
“But this situation has already improved: after a year of the special group’s work, half of the parents who had categorically refused to treat their children’s HIV had changed their minds, allowed diagnostics to be run, and started to take medications”, said the AIDS Center’s press secretary, Elena Loseva.
According to her, it’s impossible to influence parents using legal methods, and consequently, not all HIV-infected children are successfully identified: the mothers don’t allow them to be examined, go into hiding, and run away from the hospital with their children.
What dangers do HIV dissidents present?
At the end of last year, Saint Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first Russian study on the so-called HIV-dissident movement.
People who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medicine are called HIV-dissidents.
Doctors and activists of AIDS service NGOs call these views anti-medical and see their spread as a serious threat.
A gruesome photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, happened on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechany train station in Khmelnytskyi.
A joyful group of tipsy young people was walking across a bridge over the railroad tracks, right where a freight train stood.
One of the friends came up with the idea of taking a dramatic selfie on the roof of the wagon, the police communications desk in Khmelnytskyi Oblast reported to FAKTY.
The young man started to climb down from the bridge onto the train, but, as a result of his carelessness, got hooked on the power line and was instantly electrocuted.
Fortunately, the station dispatcher found out about this incident and quickly called an ambulance.
The injured individual was moved to a safe place before the arrival of doctors and was then hospitalized in the burn unit of the Khmelnytskyi Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with 1st and 2nd degree burns to his torso.
Right now, doctors assess his condition as stable.
Law enforcement officials remind us that extreme selfies, taken on the roofs of tall buildings, on bridges, and on top of moving vehicles, have gained increasing popularity as of late.
Police are asking people to be vigilant and not allow these types of photo sessions, especially among children and teenagers.
Scientists have accepted the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
Oceans could have existed on ancient Venus.
French scientists have put forward such a hypothesis.
The experts created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of planets, writes Science News.
It turns out that, at the beginning of its history, oceans, which contained 10% more water than is currently on Earth, formed on Venus.
Earlier, Argumenty Nedeli wrote that, according to the scientists’ hypothesis, an ocean also could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Over the course of their research, the foreign experts came to the conclusion that the body of water was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured due to a shooting in a park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were injured due to a shooting, the Associated Press reports.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park when a considerable number of visitors were present.
According to witnesses, several men who were on the bridge started shouting threats.
One of them pulled out a gun and started shooting at people.
It wasn’t possible to discern the appearances of the perpetrators since they were completely covered-up, except for their eyes.
Another one was given medical assistance, after which he was let go.
The third wounded individual is a minor and there are no details about his condition.
Dolores Park, located on a hill, is a popular place among local residents and tourists.
On July 1, at least 17 people were wounded during a shooting in a nightclub in the city of Little Rock in the state of Arkansas.
Several patrons also were injured while trying to escape the building.
The rock band Louna will debut a new album in Barnaul
A concert by the rock band Louna will be held in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will debut their new album, “Brave New World”, which has become one of the year’s most anticipated releases.
The group is preparing a conceptual show, which will become the most spectacular in the band’s concert history.
“Brave New World” is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
Its title stems from A. Huxley’s famous dystopian novel, “Brave New World”.
The new songs don’t rehash the book, but rather speak about a society that lives according to dystopian law, “blindly believing the propaganda and imposed values”.
Listeners helped the band collect money to record the album: more than 1,200 people supported the project on the Planeta.ru website.
Louna released their first album, “Let’s Get Louder!”, in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians debuted their record “Time X”, and, in 2013, they recorded the album “We are Louna” (2013).
In the fall of 2015, the band Louna performed the “Songs about the World” program with a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall.
The band Louna consists of: Lousine Gevorkian (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass), Rouben Kazariyan (guitar), Sergey Ponkratiev (guitar), and Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will be held at Barnaul’s “Pharaoh” club on October 17 at 7 p.m.
Ticket prices range from 1,200 to 2,600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most sought-after groups in the Russian rock scene.
The group was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The group has won several times in various categories of the “Chart Dozen” hit parade.
Travellers negotiate trench, return to 'Millionaire's row'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.
Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.
Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.
The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.'
She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'
One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'
Crimea is incorporating the New World sparkling wine factory
It appears from an order by the Minister of Property and Land Relations for Crimea, Anna Anyukhina, that a decision has been made to incorporate the Republic of Crimea’s state unitary enterprise, New World sparkling wine factory, as JSC New World sparkling wine factory.
100% of the enterprise’s shares will remain the property of the government of Crimea.
The public company’s charter capital will amount to 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5.955 million common shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
Crimea’s Ministry of Agriculture has stated that, if funds to modernize the enterprise are not found over the next three years, then there will be a risk of a factory shutdown.
Depreciation of the enterprise’s fixed assets is around 60-70%.
1.2 billion rubles are required to modernize the enterprise. Given the nature of its legal and organizational form, it is obliged to hand over 50% of its profits to the state budget.
That which is left is insufficient to implement the modernization program.
“Getting the money from the owner is problematic, suggesting borrowing funds from large credit institutions is difficult”, said the deputy head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea, Sergei Petelin, in April of this year.
Crimea’s parliament has included the enterprise in the privatization forecast plan for 2017.
It was suggested that its incorporation be carried out and to put it up for sale.
An Interfax source in the Crimean organs of power assessed the possible sale price of the business at $40 million, with another $30 million to be put in for modernization by an investor.
In 2016, New World increased production of sparkling wines by 2.8%, as compared to the 2015 level, to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, New World planned to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was established in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn, as a factory to produce sparkling wine at the New World estate acquired by him.
The factory is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third-graders knocked over more than 40 headstones
Officers of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of the Interior for Nizhny Novgorod Oblast have established the identities of the citizens who destroyed 46 headstones at the cemetery in the town of Lyskovo.
The miscreants turned out to be students in the third grade.
The Department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for Lyskovo District received the first report about gravestones being damaged by unknown individuals back on June 27.
In total, 24 people contacted the police in connection with this.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation: “Destruction, damage, or desecration of burial sites”.
According to the results of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, who turned out to be two schoolchildren, aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing how the memorials fell, and this incited them to commit these acts of hooliganism.
Preventative measures have been carried out with both the children and their parents.
Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.
Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“We don’t want to be associated with any particular party to the conflict in Libya”
As of late, the Russian administration has noticeably intensified its policies on the Libyan front, and visits to Moscow by delegations from Libya’s opposing sides have become more frequent.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement under the auspices the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and State Duma and assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dengov, told Kommersant what objectives Moscow is pursuing in this region and whom they are placing their bets on.
There is almost nothing known about the contact group that you head on Libya.
While, for example, everyone knows about the contact group on Ukraine.
But, in this case, there is a veil of secrecy.
What exactly are you doing and what objectives are you pursuing?
The contact group was established at the initiative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the State Duma.
Its activities are overseen by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (a Duma deputy from Chechnya – Kommersant).
The latter was authorized to work on the Libya issue by State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for establishing the group was the detainment of the Russian tanker, Mekhanik Chebotarev, in Libya (in September 2015; 11 people were on board – Kommersant).
We were thinking about how to help the crew.
It was at this time that the contact group, consisting of military experts and State Duma representatives, was created, and the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, supported our work.
And how did it turn out that you, specifically, took charge of it?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, they approached me with the offer to lead the work of the group.
Our efforts weren’t restricted to the release of the sailors from the Mekhanik Chebotarev.
We managed to establish contacts with representatives of all the major groups opposing each other in Libyan conflict: both from the Tripoli camp (where the UN recognized government led by Fayez al-Sarraj is based – Kommersant) and from Tobruk (home to the parliament that opposes the government and supports Marshall Halif Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya – Kommersant).
Thanks to the active involvement of Ahmed Maiteeq (the deputy prime minister of Libya – Kommersant), we managed to quickly negotiate the release of the Russian sailors.
That is when it was decided to make more effective use of these contacts and create the contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and actors, and create a dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to specifically emphasize that we don’t want to be associated with any particular party to the conflict in Libya; we are engaged in dialogue with everyone.
How many people are part of the contact group and how many of them are permanently posted in Libya?
Currently, five people are part of the contact group.
Among them are people who have experience working in the security agencies, including the Ministry of Defense.
We would also like to bring regional experts, members of the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Middle East Institute, into the group.
None of our staff are permanently posted in Libya, as there is currently no need for this.
Are there Russian military advisers and instructors in Libya right now?
And, if yes, whose side are they on?
There are no Russian military experts in Libya.
All the talk and reports about this are inconsistent with reality.
But there are ex-military members in your contact group…
Yes, and their presence is essential.
For example, when we visit combat zones.
Or, those cities that, up to a certain point, are closed to us, like Misurata (where rebel forces, who played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and became noticeably more active in following years, are based – Kommersant).
We travelled to Misurata in January of this year.
They frightened us, saying that it was full of Islamists and terrorists there.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there for ourselves: to analyze the actual military capacity, who is responsible for what, why such rumors are floating about, and what the real role of the Islamists is there.
In Misurata, we met with all of the representatives of the units that were engaged in destroying IS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from militants of the Islamic State, which is banned in Russia – Kommersant).
We wanted to take a look at them, to get to know these people, to verify the intelligence that it was actually these people who played a decisive role in destroying IS in Libya and not Halif Haftar, who has taken credit for these achievements.
And what conclusion did you come to?
Was it not Haftar who defeated the Islamic State in Libya?
It wasn’t him engaged in this.
Haftar was staging an operation on a different front, in Benghazi.
While entities loyal to the government in Tripoli were fighting against IS in Sirte.
By the way, we invited the people who carried out this antiterrorist operation to Russia.
And they came: the visit lasted from April 19-23 of this year, and the Libyan delegation was received by the Federation Council, the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Russian National Guard.
You, as we understand, visit all of Libya’s regions, and probably understand the sentiments of local elites and field commanders.
What do you think: will it be possible to implement the agreements on a ceasefire and holding elections that Halif Haftar and Fayez al-Sarraj reached in July in Paris?
Or, as has happened multiple times in the past already, will the agreements be broken, will combat operations be resumed, and will the sides attempt to seize power single-handedly?
For us, the very fact that al-Sarraj and Haftar have agreed to another meeting is a good sign: this wasn’t possible even a short while ago.
In the recent past, both the leaders spoke very negatively about one another.
As far as Russia’s position is concerned…
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, and many believe this.
We were confronted with this situation when we were in Misurata, and Haftar, on that very same day, came aboard the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But they didn’t believe it was a coincidence in Misurata.
They said to us: “You, it seems, are very brave people for coming to us on today of all days”.
But our aim, in fact, is to show that we don’t just support Haftar, but that we are engaged in dialogue with all of the major parties to the conflict in Libya.
You have associated with Haftar.
Does the fact that he twice studied in the USSR make mutual understanding with Russian partners easier on a personal and emotional level?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
If he even knows Russian, then it’s only a little bit.
But the fact that he studied here, of course, makes dialogue with him easier.
And not just with him, in fact.
When we associate with military officials in Tripoli and Misurata, we meet generals who have either studied in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And they speak Russian very well.
And they are drawn to Russia; they feel nostalgic about it to a certain extent.
Do you consider a lifting of the arms embargo placed on Libya likely in the near future?
Are your Libyan partners interested in shipments of Russian arms?
Of course they are interested, but as I’ve already said, we’re not taking anyone’s side in this conflict and we wouldn’t want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be on a more or less equal footing.
As far as the arms embargo is concerned, the Libyan side is constantly calling on Russia to somehow facilitate its removal.
Right now the constitution-drafting process is actively moving ahead in Libya.
We hope that the sides will come to a compromise and achieve internal consensus.
After that, elections should be held, which was discussed at the meeting between al-Sarraj and Haftar.
If elections take place and a legitimate government is finally chosen (and right now, none of the parties enjoy that status), then it will be possible to bring up the issue of lifting the arms embargo in the UN Security Council.
Raising this issue right now is pointless and dangerous: it would only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
The other day, information made it into the media about how Italy, faced with the issue of African refugees sailing from Libya, feels like it is being left high and dry by its allies in the EU.
Can Moscow help its Italian partners with this situation, by using its connections with the Libyans?
For example, how realistic an option is it for Haftar’s units to establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of the smugglers who are trafficking immigrants into Europe?
That’s a very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need Russia’s support, because Moscow is engaged in simultaneous dialogue with Haftar, and with al-Sarraj, and with Misurata, and with the south of the country.
The tribes in the south of Libya play a big role in this matter, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Are you talking about Southerners stopping the flow of migrants on the periphery?
So, figuratively speaking, they have turned back the buses, on which the Nigerian migrants are riding?
We are aiming for this.
But it isn’t easy.
Some clans and groups have an interest in keeping these flows going.
We hope to facilitate the inclusion of Southerners in the negotiation process between al-Sarraj, Haftar, and the tribes in the South.
But first, we would like to see unanimity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and al-Sarraj.
The head of the government in Tripoli, Fayez al-Sarraj, is considered to be an Islamist and a proponent of the introduction of sharia law in the country.
How radical are the views that he holds?
Won’t this become an obstacle to building a relationship with Russia or the West?
I will tell you my personal opinion of him.
In my view, he, on the contrary, is an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he personally supports the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country: moderately Islamic and open to the world.
And he is also actively fighting against terrorists.
Then why does he have such a reputation?
It’s created by those countries that are interested in preventing Russia from associating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital after all: it’s where the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government are located.
The national oil corporation is there, the national bank, and other government institutions.
Of course, some countries had an interest in not having us involved there.
But we’ve gone and thwarted their plans and have started to engage with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we’re already reaping the rewards of this work: Rosneft has signed a partnership agreement with Libya’s National Oil Company (NOC).
The director of NOC, Mustafa Sanallah, with whom the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, signed the deal, is himself directly from Tripoli.
Two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I believe it will be resold.
And what other economic interests does Russia have in Libya?
There are plans to resign contracts that were concluded under Muammar Gaddafi.
In particular, we are talking about previous agreements in the transportation sector (the construction of railways), the energy sector (electrification), and several other sectors.
And do the Libyans have anything to pay with?
Well, they have oil.
In other words, what we’re talking about, as is the case with Iran, is an arrangement of “oil in exchange for services”?
I don’t know what kind of arrangement it will be; I’m not directly involved with these matters.
In fact, economics aren’t the most important thing for Russia in Libya.
Ultimately, we are engaged in peace-building efforts there.
For us, the most important thing is to stop the bloodshed and to help the Libyans come to an agreement between themselves, so that they can establish order there and so that Libya stops being a breeding ground for terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main objective: to help the Libyan people and to force the terrorists out of there.
Do you have numbers on the presence (either currently or previously) of radical fighters from Russia or other former Soviet states in Libya?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to figure this out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan state security committee, who said that, at the moment, there isn’t a single native of Russia or any of the other former Soviet states there.
He said that he has around 50,000 recordings of telephone conversations of members of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya – Kommersant) and no spoken Russian can be heard.
But which states are the fighters coming from then?
I wouldn’t want to go into these details.
Then we’ll put the question differently.
How many of the Islamist fighters in Libya are Libyan themselves.
There are hardly any Libyans among them: they make up no more than 5%.
The rest of them are outsiders.
Could Moscow lead intra-Libyan negotiations according to the Paris model?
There are such plans.
We are holding active negotiations with the Libyans; several delegations have already visited Moscow, and they have announced their readiness to come again, to either Moscow or Grozny.
When might these negotiations take place?
It’s hard to say right now.
Several visits still need to take place, at which point I hope there will be some clarity as to the time and place of the negotiations.
Benefactors at the Chekhov Museum raised money for an expensive gift for a sick boy
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Matsola, who has cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus, and is completely blind, will receive the gift of a specialized treadmill on August 5 at the Moscow-area Melikhovo museum-reserve.
The useful present will be awarded to Sasha by the Minister of Culture for Moscow Oblast, Oksana Kosareva, and by the museum’s director, Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the exercise equipment was raised during the “Don’t stop doing good deeds” charity marathon, which took place at Melikhovo on July 15 on Chekhov Memorial Day.
In the days leading up to the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino in Chekhov District, which said: “My eyes can’t see anything, so I asked my mama to write this letter”.
“I would really like to receive the gift of a treadmill, so my legs can become strong, and so that I can learn how to walk a little bit”.
And now Sasha’s dream has come true!
After the presentation, a “Post Scriptum Concert” will be held at the museum-reserve, where the famous pianist and honored artist of Russia, Alexander Gindin, will play a medley of popular classical works.
The Ascension of David Monastery Choir, bell-ringers from Ilya Drozdikhin’s school, students from the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory and the Gnessin Academy of Music, and actors from the Melikhovo Theater’s Chekhov Studio performed during the charity marathon at Melikhovo.
Auctions were held for visitors, and a book fair and a charity sale of souvenirs with the logo of the marathon were organized.
The Melikhovo museum-reserve came forward with the initiative to make July 15 Chekhov Memorial Day: a collective day of charity for all the museums in the Moscow area.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk, in Zhytomyr Oblast, fired several shots, near the local football stadium, in the direction of teenagers who were there.
In the words of the suspect, he was enraged by the noise, the department of police communication for Zhytomyr Oblast reported to FAKTY.
After this, the man went to a café located nearby.
A conflict arose with him on the premises, during which the man discharged a device used to shoot rubber bullets, wounding one of the patrons.
The 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care and there is no threat to his life.
Police and emergency medical services responded to the scene; however, by that time, the shooter had fled.
Law enforcement officials established his identity and arrested him that same day, on August 2.
The man was unable to explain his actions.
The device used to shoot rubber bullets was seized from him and was sent for analysis.
Based on the evidence, criminal proceedings have been initiated under Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The individual in custody faces imprisonment for a period of between 3 to 7 years.
You will recall that, on the night of July 28, an assault involving gunfire took place in Kiev in the Lukyanivka neighborhood near Tatarska Street.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to better her own.
She has not accepted responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgeny Bogachev: “I let Langford go, like a high-flying bird”
One of the VTB United League’s best basketball players, 33-year-old Keith Langford, has left UNICS.
UNICS President Evgeny Bogachev commented on the departure of the American defenseman to Izvestia.
Keith made this decision for family reasons, Evgeny Bogachev said.
He has a small child and a wife who don’t want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to accommodate him.
Of course, I could have said “no” and extended his contract, but he deserved better treatment.
He played three seasons with UNICS and performed at a high-level each match, putting in 100% effort.
And that’s why I let him go, like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and his playing career.
Keith Langford played for the Kazan club for three years, winning silver in the 2015-16 United League.
In the 2016-17 season, he received the award for the top-scoring player of the season in the EuroLeague.
He earned an average of 21.75 points per match.
This result is the second highest since 2004, when this award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in EuroLeague history to receive this prize more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with China’s Shenzhen, Eurohoops informs.
It is expected that the American will conclude a 2-year contract in the amount of 5 million dollars.
Langford will be the second EuroLeague star in July who transfers to the Chinese Championship.
Earlier, Panathinaikos’ former center, Ioannis Bourousis, moved to the Chinese CBA.
A sunburnt tourist from Moscow region was evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Today, Adygea emergency response personnel used a helicopter to evacuate a tourist from the Moscow area, who sustained a severe sunburn, from the republic’s mountainous region.
The man was vacationing at the Fisht camping shelter, which is situated at an altitude of 1,600 meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had elevated blood pressure and was also having difficulty breathing.
The preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The leader of the tour group, who said that the man had sustained a sunburn while hiking, contacted emergency response personnel.
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the moves as recalls.
European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.
The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.
In Astrakhan, a café patron paid with counterfeit money
The police received a report from a female employee of a bank branch about a suspicious bill, in the denomination of 5,000 rubles, which came from a fast-food establishment and was detected during a money count.
An examination, conducted at the Criminal Expertise Center, determined that it was counterfeit.
The Regional Office of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for Astrakhan Oblast reports that one of the café patrons, who bought a shawarma, paid with the banknote.
It’s worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device to determine the authenticity of the bill.
Currently, police are in the process of identifying the individuals involved in the manufacture and distribution of the knowingly counterfeit Russian Central Bank bill.
These types of crimes are punishable by imprisonment for a period of up to 8 years, with a fine in the amount of 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is urging residents of Astrakhan Oblast to be attentive when making financial transactions; it is recommended that employees of sales outlets install devices to determine the authenticity of money received.
Astronomers have discovered a “hellish” planet where even iron can be melted
Having studied the properties of the stratosphere of the giant exoplanet called WASP-121b for the first time, astrophysicists were more than a little surprised by its temperature, which is capable of vaporizing iron and other metals.
The experts noticed that water molecules were heated to such an extent by the light of the star that they were emitting infrared radiation.
The Hubble Space Telescope captured the light from water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature forces the water in the planet’s atmosphere to glow in the infrared band.
WASP-121b falls into the category of so-called “hot Jupiters”: gas giants that, in terms of size and mass, are comparable to the biggest planets of the Solar System, but are located ten times closer to their parent star.
On account of this, a year on the exoplanet lasts for just 1.3 “Earth days”, and its atmosphere is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Provence lavender under threat from climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."
And a lot is at stake.
As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.
The ambassador of the 2019 Winter Universiade met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world champion in hockey and ambassador of the 2019 Winter Universiade, Alexander Semin, met with beginner hockey players the other day and signed autographs for fans.
The meeting took place at the 2019 Winter Universiade tent, as part of a week dedicated to ice hockey.
Each visitor to the tent could skate on a rink with artificial ice.
In addition to this, relay races, trivia quizzes and games with souvenirs from the student games for prizes, and a workout routine from the Federation of Aerobics were organized.
50 schoolchildren took part in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the kids to get as involved as possible in sport activities and stressed that the most important thing when starting out is hard work and an enormous desire to play hockey.
“It’s great that there’s a place in Krasnoyarsk like the 2019 Winter Universiade tent, where beginner athletes can ask team coaches questions in person”, the champion said.
It bears noting that the 2019 Winter Universiade ambassadors will help to promote student sport and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk residents.
The Universiade tent will continue to operate for the entire summer season, up until September 25, reports the press service for the 2019 Winter Universiade Directorate.
The State Department has commented on Medvedev’s words
The official spokesperson for the US State Department, Heather Nauert, commenting on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at a briefing, spoke about the need to find “areas of cooperation” with Russia.
In her words, such areas need to be found in order to “improve bilateral cooperation”.
She named the agreement on the ceasefire in Syria as an example of such successful collaboration.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
“And people throughout the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other”, the diplomat said.
That being said, Nauert declined to comment on Medvedev’s assertion about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
“If Russia said this, well, of course it has a right to say this, but I can’t say anything more on this topic”, the State Department spokesperson said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, Medvedev, the head of the Russian government, stated that Washington has declared a full-fledged trade war against Moscow, putting to rest hopes for an improvement in bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that the US sanctions would last for decades.
Furthermore, the prime minister believes that the American establishment has “fully outwitted” Trump.
A bodybuilder, who went missing in the Moscow area, was found in a stranger’s dacha suffering from memory loss
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov went missing on the road to Noginsk on July 25, under entirely fascinating circumstances: he stepped out of the car to go to the toilet.
Friends and local residents spent seven days unsuccessfully looking for him.
But Shamil was found at a stranger’s dacha in Ramensky.
The owner found him completely naked in his bathroom.
The Dagestani athlete was unable to explain how he got there and what had happened to him.
He couldn’t even remember what his name was and his passport was missing.
Notices about his disappearance helped to identify him.
The medics who responded to the call established that Khanmetov had partial memory loss and a traumatic brain injury, the Mash public page reports.
It is likely that the athlete is in for even more surprises.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil have probably already been to his apartment, the keys for which they also stole from him.
Oil and gas revenues for July have exceeded forecasts by 7.4 billion rubles
At the end of July 2017, actual oil and gas revenues earned exceeded estimates by 7.4 billion rubles, the Russian Ministry of Finance reports.
The surplus, the agency explains, occurred largely as a result of the higher US dollar to ruble exchange rate compared to the monthly average for June that was used for the estimate, as well as by virtue of the fact that actual gas production and the volume of exports of petroleum products exceeded projected levels.
“In August 2017, the deviation of oil and gas revenues in the federal budget from the monthly estimate, according to the federal law on the federal budget for 2017-2019, is projected to be +40.2 billion rubles”, a Ministry of Finance statement says.
As such, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic foreign exchange market for the period of August 7 to September 6, 2017, amounts to RUB 47.6 billion.
Accordingly, the daily purchase volume of foreign currencies will amount to an equivalent of RUB 2.07 billion.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the foreign currency purchase transactions made by the Russian Ministry of Finance.
Every business day, over the course of the specified period, the Central Bank will carry out foreign currency purchase transactions via trading on the Moscow Exchange, at regular intervals throughout the trading day.
The foreign currency purchased will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.
It's important to change their routines, they are told.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.
Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.
His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.
Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.
"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two errors contributed to the killing.
First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.
Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.
He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.
"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.
Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.
"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting one's instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape constantly shifts.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.
For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.
There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.
Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.
Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a wrenching decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.
And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.
Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.
From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.
Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'
The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'
The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.
After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.
It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.
'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.
'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.
Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.
Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.
I can count the scales on its sole.'
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get into Poland without documents
Mikheil Saakashvili, who formerly led Georgia and then Odessa Oblast in Ukraine, arrived by plane in Poland.
Furthermore, he did this without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
The arrival of Saakashvili was reported by the Polish publication Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his address on their YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at the event to commemorate the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising against Hitler’s troops in 1944.
Since the politician doesn’t know Polish, even though he attempted to start his speech in that language, he had to speak in English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician touched on the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The embattled politician learned about the fact that Ukraine’s migration service had revoked his citizenship while he was in the United States.
It is still unclear how he managed to make the transatlantic flight without documents.
Earlier, the former governor of Odessa Oblast, Mikheil Saakashvili, stated that his signature on the application form for Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had never filled-out any such forms.
The period of investigation for the case against Vainzikher and Olkhovik has been extended until January
The time period for the preliminary investigation into the case against the co-owner of the Renova group of companies, Yevgeny Olkhovik, and the head of T Plus energy holding, Boris Vainzikher, has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmanny Court is considering the matter of extending house arrest for the accused parties.
A spokesperson for the Investigative Committee reported the most recent decision to extend the time period for the preliminary investigation at a meeting.
“The particular complexity and duration of the investigation stems from the need to seize and conduct an examination of a large volume of documents, as well as carry out investigative measures in several constituent entities of the Russian Federation”, the investigator declared.
He added that the suspects regularly paid bribes to leaders in Komi.
Their total sum is estimated at no less than a billion rubles.
According to investigators, Vainzikher, Olkhovik, and the former head of CJSC Integrated Energy Systems, Mikhail Slobodin (who ran the company VimpelCom up until September 5), were handing over bribes to senior government officials in the Komi Republic in return for the establishment of extremely lucrative rates for thermal and electric power, as well as for the creation of favorable business conditions.
Vainzikher and Olkhovik were apprehended, transported to Syktyvkar, and held under arrest for two months; Slobodin has evaded investigators and was put on the federal wanted list.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.
Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."
"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
In that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.
It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."
"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.
"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.
Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.
There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.
They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.
Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It all just came."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.
Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."
Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.
"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Two Salvadoran football players were suspended for biting US players
Team El Salvador football players Henry Romero and Darwin Cerén received long-term suspensions for unsportsmanlike behavior.
During the quarterfinal match of the Confederation of North, Central American, and Caribbean Association Football’s (CONCACAF) Gold Cup, the Salvadorans bit American players.
The defender Henry Romero was the first to make his mark.
The Salvadoran bit striker Jozy Altidore and then he pinched his chest.
Then, midfielder Cerén, during a corner kick in his penalty area, bit US defender Omar Gonzalez.
Consequently, Romero was suspended for three matches and Cerén for six.
The game itself ended with a victory for the Americans with a score of 2:0, Goal.com reports.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.
By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.
From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.
That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.
There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.
When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.
"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."
The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.
It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.
"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.
"I get goosebumps still talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.
That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.
Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
A fire in a 79-storey tower in Dubai has been put out
The massive blaze, which occurred in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch Tower, has been put out, Reuters reports.
It is noted that firefighters managed to deal with all of the sources of fire by 4:00 a.m. local time (3:00 a.m. Moscow Time).
Local authorities reported that no one was hurt as a result of the incident.
The roads around the skyscraper were closed while the fire was being put out.
The causes of the incident are still unknown.
Earlier, it was reported that the 79-storey residential skyscraper in Dubai, The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, was on fire.
All the residents were evacuated in time.
Buzova’s jaw-dropping outfit shocks fans: pants that don’t cover panties
Olga Buzova, the scandalous host of the reality TV show “Home 2”, astounded spectators of the Europa Plus Live festival by dancing in panties.
The newly minted singer performed the song “We will be hot”, in a duet with Nastia Kudry, in front of thousands of fans.
Both girls hit the stage in provocative “pants”, sewn in such a fashion that the singers’ undergarments were in plain view.
The pants were inscribed with the names Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier, it was reported that a specialist from one of Moscow’s plastic surgery clinics commented on changes in Buzova’s appearance.
Stoltenberg has acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
Radio 4 news service reported this on Friday, August 4, with reference to foreign media organizations.
According to him, it is the Russian government that is responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the Secretary General of NATO also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and for “destabilization in the east of Ukraine”.
That being said, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia is nevertheless possible, and that further escalation of the situation would not be beneficial to any of the parties involved.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump stated that relations between the United States and Russia are at a dangerously low level and he blamed the US Congress for this.
Yekaterinburg’s metro is introducing a new method of payment
In October, it will be possible to pay for travel on Yekaterinburg’s metro using a bankcard, the General Director of OAO I-Network, Pavel Vedernikov, announced in an interview with Oblastnaya Gazeta.
Our objective is to introduce the same type of payment system for travel on the metro as in other major cities like Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, and Novosibirsk for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
“We would like fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metropolitan using their bankcards, without having to get tokens or wait in line”, he said.
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.
Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
So she called in outsiders for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.
"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.
Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.
"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.
"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.
Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.
Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.
But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?' "
Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.
And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."
In Barnaul, the new asphalt on Krasnoarmeyskiy Prospekt is being dug up
In Barnaul, drastic measures have been taken to determine the reason for asphalt cave-ins on Krasnoarmeyskiy Prospekt.
A decision has been made to “dig up” the area where holes have twice appeared on the recently paved roadway (at the intersection with Molodyozhnaya Street).
To recap, the collapse of a small section of the road close to the tram tracks happened as a result of the ground sinking in the area of an abandoned and out-of-operation utilities network.
According to the deputy chair of the city committee for road facilities, improvements, transport, and communications, Ivan Garmat, they will conduct a thorough examination to achieve a detailed survey and eliminate the conditions that led to the collapse.
Necessary measures will be taken according to its results.
It is anticipated that reconstruction of the abandoned utility lines and their encasement in concrete will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the territory’s capital.
The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices makes for a long day for the Bruins
It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.
Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.
For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.
Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.
"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.
The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.
"We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.
I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."
UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.
If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we got.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place."
All the victims of the terror attack in Saint Petersburg have been released from hospital
Everyone who was injured during the terror attack in the Saint Petersburg metro in April has been released from hospital.
This was reported by the press service of Vice-Governor Anna Mityanina.
As of the end of July, three people remained in hospital, TV Tsentr reports.
You will recall that an explosion rattled the Saint Petersburg metropolitan on April 3 of this year.
The bomb was detonated by suicide bomber Akbarzhon Dzhalilov.
15 people died as a result of the terrorist attack, as did the perpetrator himself.
11 people were arrested on criminal charges, including the suspected mastermind, Abror Azimov.
You will recall that, the other day, Rospotrebnadzor recommended that the Saint Petersburg metropolitan reassess its action plan to ensure transport security, including increasing the number of walk-through metal detectors.
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook is to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact checkers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September.
On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.
She added that Facebook would keep testing its "related article" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news.
Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story
In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent, now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."
Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.
To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too.
Ah, I love archives!"
For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.
Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."
Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.
Just let it go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.
"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."
With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences.
He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney holds a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"
Fifteen of the largest banks choose “Russia”
A conflict is developing within the Association of Russian Banks (ARB): another seven credit organizations are preparing to ditch this non-governmental organization, taking their cue from Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, B&N Bank, and Otkritie FC.
As such, the share of those that have left the ARB will account for no less than 80 percent of the market.
But this isn’t just a departure: all the banks that have announced their break with the ARB are in negotiations with another non-governmental organization that unites credit institutions, the Association of Regional Banks of Russia, which is led by the well-known politician, Anatoly Aksakov, chair of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, who was, in fact, recognized at the end of the last session as the most effective Duma committee leader and deputy, in terms of the amount of draft legislation prepared.
The conflict inside of the ARB started during a discussion in the Federation Council, when new bills were being reviewed in the Interregional Banking Council, including those calling for a new classification of banks in relation to the size of their authorized capital.
At that time, Garegin Tosunyan, President of the ARB, said that, in the association’s opinion, this bill was being adopted in the interests of the largest banks, who were using this method to try and limit opportunities for small and medium-size banks in the regions, while poaching their customer base.
Among other complaints, criticism was also voiced against the Central Bank, which, to Tosunyan’s mind, is not always justified in revoking the licenses of some banks, which, truth be told, was followed by an objection from a representative of the Central Bank: many of the managers of the banks at fault, particularly Vneshprombank, were members of the ARB’s governing bodies.
Apparently, this exchange of conflicting opinions, in a banking environment that is highly sensitive to relations with the main regulator, was the apparent reason for the fifteen largest banks, having expressed their disagreement with ARB policies, to start preparing to join the “Russia” association, noting that the “efficacy of the ARB’s work is poor, and that there is virtually no constructive dialogue conducted within the banking association”.
Depositors will be better off
How will things end?
Right away, let’s answer the main question that comes up with the slightest upset or conflict in the banking sector or close to it: depositors are in no danger, if anything, the reliability of the banking system will improve.
“Russia” is led by Anatoly Aksakov, known for his scrupulousness in everything concerning the interests of banks and their clients; a first-rate professional who is highly regarded at the Central Bank: virtually the entire leadership of the Central Bank attends the association’s annual events, and all of the regulator’s relevant legislative initiatives go through the expert evaluations of the “regionals”.
In human resources and organizational terms, it is also clear that no significant disturbances are expected.
There’s no question that the ARB is putting itself in a complex financial and administrative situation, after losing such powerful and influential members with their financial contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, there is still a lot of potential in this long-standing (established in 1991) organization, which advocates for the interests of the banking community, to continue to improve banking legislation and the area of monetary and credit circulation in general.
That’s not to say that the “Russia” association is ready to welcome new members with open arms on any terms, judging from the reaction of its director, Anatoly Aksakov (“perhaps they want too much”), who, back on July 21, at a briefing at Parlamentskaya Gazeta’s press center, said that “the very next day, representatives from the banks that left the ARB were asking me to look at the possibility of expanding the potential of our ‘Russia’ association”.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers on the association’s board, as well as to focus more on new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is currently underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, and the agenda is being prepared for the association’s extraordinary congress, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of the international baking forum.
And that’s where we will make a decision.
Furthermore, Anatoly Aksakov, making it clear that he “isn’t clinging to the position”, named Grigory Luntovsky, who is leaving his post as deputy chair of the Central Bank in September, as the possible new head of a revamped “Russia” association, having spoken highly of his professional and personal qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently vacationing in Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day to travel to Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the board of the “Russia” association, where it is planned to discuss the matter of the agenda for the extraordinary congress of “Russia”.
The entry of gasoline-powered cars into major cities in Russia will not be restricted
The deputy head of the Ministry of Transport, Nikolai Asaul, stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of gasoline-powered cars into major cities in Russia would not be restricted yet.
This is a more radical version of our concept.
Our concept is that it’s necessary to gradually improve the emission class.
And there, the concept is to immediately move to zero emissions.
I believe that, in terms of technology, we are not ready for this.
The question still is: as of what year?
It’s, like, on the same level as slogans with the phrase: “Let’s Ban It!”
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will we close the whole city?
“In 20 years time, I don’t know, maybe that might happen”, Prime quotes the minister as saying.
Earlier, Izvestia newspaper reported that Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich has been assigned to study, by August 17, proposals on possible options for state support of electric transport, which were submitted to the government by the CEO of PJSC KAMAZ, Sergey Kogonin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper’s information, is the use of cars with internal combustion engines in major cities and resorts.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
There is going to be new US immigration plan to modify Green Card rules, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the president.
The draft law is due to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do this by changing the way the US issues Green Cards to citizens from other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, have financial resources to support themselves and show skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.
Yep.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.
"People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.
But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness.
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality," the True Companion website enthuses.
So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.
She also has moods during the day just like real people!
She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real, human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the rapey connotations of making a move on Frigid (read: resistant) Farrah, are the most concerning.
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.
However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.
Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture.
But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.
And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.
There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.
Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, pointedly, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.
They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out.
They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.
They are pleasant slaves, in other words.
Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.
The Los Angeles native, Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, competing for Team Ukraine since 2013, won’t be helping our national team in the European Basketball Championship, the final phase of which starts on August 31.
The general manager for the “blue-and-yellows”, Andrei Lebedev, spoke about this in an interview with the BeBasket website.
We tried to come to an agreement with Jeter, but unfortunately, he won’t be coming due to family circumstances.
We will go to Eurobasket without the naturalized player, since we don’t want to take someone we don’t know.
“This situation will give us an opportunity to develop our young players”, he said.
Let me remind you that, with Jeter’s direct involvement, Team Ukraine claimed a record sixth place for itself in Eurobasket 2013, and, for the first time, made it into the World Basketball Championship, where the “yellow-and-blues” were unable to make it past the group stage, but the US native averaged 15.4 points, three rebounds, and 5 assists per game.
Jeter stopped playing for Team Ukraine at the time of the departure of the head coach for our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
The 2017 Men’s Eurobasket will be held in four countries at the same time: Turkey, Romania, Israel, and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will play its group stage matches in the Promise Land.
Evgeni Murzin’s protégés in Group B will have five battles against Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (September 3), Lithuania (September 5), and Israel (September 6).
As part of their training for the tournament, our men’s team played two friendly matches, which they lost to the Dutch and the Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.
Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.
Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it carries significant risks.
The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.
When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal.
There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump "normalises" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable.
I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.
The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting.
So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.
In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while, wearily, I gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars.
Oscar Pistorius taken from jail to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has left jail for a hospital visit.
Last year he was taken to the hospital for treatment to cuts on his wrists, which prison authorities said he sustained after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder hiding in the cubicle.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius faces having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The individual suspected of beating an NTV journalist has been ordered not to leave town
The capital’s law enforcement officials have imposed a pre-trial restraint in the form of travel restrictions on the man who assaulted an NTV television channel journalist, Nikita Razvozzhayev, during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
TASS reported this, citing the official spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, Irina Volk.
“As part of the criminal investigation initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Battery), in relation to the 32-year-old man who hit a correspondent of one of the television channels in the face in the Gorky Central Park of Culture and Leisure, a pre-trial restraint in the form of travel restrictions and proper conduct has been imposed on the suspect”, Volk clarified.
The spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol for failure to obey the police has been drawn up in relation to the suspect.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast for Airborne Forces Day, an inebriated man walked up to the correspondent and hit him in the face.
It turned out later that this hooligan had no connection whatsoever with the airborne forces.
According to Razvozzhayev, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarians Were Detained For Illegal Camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Foreign Affairs Ministry announced, quoted by bTV.
A group of illegally camping people, including the two Bulgarians, was detained by the police in Sithonia in the morning of August 1.
The same day they were released, while an investigation is currently underway.
The ministry of foreign affairs reported bTV that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone who is caught resting in a place not intended for the purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court may impose a fine.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has accused US Vice President Michael Pence of using Cold War era rhetoric
Statements made during US Vice President Michael Pence’s European tour came under criticism from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
“Regretfully, it must be acknowledged that Washington is slipping ever deeper into the primitive ideologically driven clichés of the Cold War era, which are entirely detached from reality”, a statement from the Russian foreign policy establishment reads.
This is how the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to Pence’s words about the “Russian threat” and attempts to forcibly redraw border, said by him in Podgorica.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out the destructiveness of a choice of “either you’re with the West, or you’re with Russia” and the questionable thesis about the allegedly incontrovertible accession of all of South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
The Russian diplomats also reminded that it was the United States, in fact, that violated international law by using force to tear Kosovo away from Serbia and consequently created yet another hotbed of tension.
“We urge our American colleagues to stop demonizing Russia and its foreign policy, which has always been based on respect for our partners and a willingness to work together constructively on mutual interests”, reads a statement by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
A paramedic was injured in a traffic accident with an ambulance in the Moscow area
The traffic accident happened in Stupino outside of the Moscow; a paramedic was injured as a result of the collision between an import vehicle and an ambulance.
Today, at approximately 8:10 a.m. (Moscow Time), a collision between a Mitsubishi vehicle and an ambulance occurred in the city of Stupino in Moscow Oblast.
“The ambulance vehicle flipped over as a result of the collision”, the press service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of the Interior for Moscow Region told TASS.
Law enforcement officials are working at the scene of the traffic accident and the circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.
In Odessa Oblast, a woman dumped her newborn son, wrapped up in a plastic bag, at a construction site.
On the evening of August 3, the Razdelnyansky police station received a report from a local resident about how he had found a bag with a newborn inside of it in a partially constructed detached house.
“Law enforcement officers and doctors responded to the scene and immediately transported the child to a medical facility”, the main office of the National Police in Odessa reported.
Medics determined that the boy was born just a few hours before he was discovered, as evidenced by the presence of an umbilical cord.
The identity of the mother was determined during preliminary investigative and operational measures: a 36-year-old local resident.
It was also established that the woman has three other young children.
As the main office noted, the family was not previously known to law enforcement officials and wasn’t registered with any particular authorities.
At this time, police are establishing the circumstances and reasons that drove the woman to commit this act, after which a procedural judgment will be made.
Currently, the newborn is under medical supervision.
Earlier, it was reported that a 21-year-old woman in Nikolaev dumped her premature baby down a garbage disposal chute.
Grigory Leps: “I’m ready to leap into action, even though I’m 55, not 30”
One of the most successful entertainers on the Russian stage, Grigory Leps, is celebrating his 55th birthday this coming Sunday.
The singer spoke with an Izvestia staff writer ahead of the celebration.
I remember how your “fiftieth” was marked.
There was a special pavilion at the Luzhniki Sports Complex, Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday boy, and there was a massive fireworks display over the Moscow River.
At that moment, you probably thought about how you’d like to spend your next five years.
Did your plans come to fruition?
If we’re talking about my career, this was a successful period.
I was working a lot, toured throughout the entire country three times, and put on between 120-130 concerts per year.
I released two decent albums.
Of course, today, I’m no longer the person I was, let’s say, 20 years ago.
You can’t fool your biological clock.
Singing like I sang in my 30s is becoming more difficult.
Still, I’m ready to leap into action and I don’t want to stop.
And, with new people, I feel like I’ll reach another level.
And you’re recording a new album with them, the first in three years.
Yes, it’s currently being worked on.
In fact, we already recorded everything in my studio and now we’ll send it off to Los Angeles for mastering.
It’s called “Why are you so serious?”, after a song by the same name, which was co-written with Timati.
It’s still not entirely ready, so we haven’t put it out anywhere yet.
We’ll do this later, when the music video for it has also been filmed.
But we’ll put the album out in November, for the series of my anniversary concerts at Moscow’s Crocus City Hall.
The first-rate American drummer, Chris Coleman, had a hand in your new record.
You, it seems, wanted to entice him to join your touring band?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most accomplished drummers in the world today.
He came to me in the studio and recorded his parts.
I invited him to join my group, and I invited Jeremy Colson (a famous drummer who is involved in various projects – Izvestia).
However, for ongoing work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
We were talking about compensation between €35,000 and €45,000 per month.
Then, I thought that I would track down worthy musicians in the post-Soviet region.
And I found an excellent drummer, Max Malyshev.
At the end of the day, it’s better to feed your own people (smiling).
From time to time, I want to find fault with one of them, but there’s no reason.
For example, the guitarist Feodor Dosymov is highly respected internationally.
Western music magazines write about him and he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Vai, having listened to him play, said “a new generation of guitarists with a different technique of playing has arrived”.
Your album is being mastered in Los Angeles, American musicians are collaborating with you, but you personally still can’t travel to the United States?
Are you trying to get this ban lifted?
Right now, to be honest, I’m not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers who are dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I am really very sorry that I can’t get into America.
I’ve mentioned more than a few times that I learn when I’m there.
The more you associate with real professionals, the better.
We’re no dumber than them, but we don’t have the same experience or schools.
Over the course of 70 years, our popular music performers were by no means faced with the same challenges that American musicians have always been tackling.
They have been working towards achieving the highest quality of sound.
And I try to follow the exact same principles.
Now, for some reason, Great Britain has banned me from entering for ten years.
But I will still submit a visa application at the British Embassy every year, so that once again, they permit me to travel, and most importantly, work there.
The rest of Europe is friendly toward me.
As early as August, you have a concert planned in Monaco, and not a private concert, but an advertised one, right?
Yes, there is a great hall in Monte Carlo, the Sporting; I performed there once already.
Now, they have invited me again, and as far as I know, all of the concert tickets have already sold out.
Will you go to the Laima Vaikule Rendezvous Festival, which starts on July 20 in Jūrmala?
She invited me, and of course, I accepted.
Laima is a remarkable singer and a magnificent woman who knows how to express herself, her beautiful vocals, and even whispers.
After the tours and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you would like to turn, once again, to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third be out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done in a completely different way.
I want to record around 80-90 of Vysotsky’s songs in the same manner of style he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
Our famous musician, Timur Vedernikov, will accompany me.
I’m also going to try and entice Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum to take part in the album.
I walked through the idea with him, we’ve got a good relationship, but he is a busy person, so we’ll have to see what happens.
You’ve also gradually introduced the songs of Boris Grebenshchikov into your repertoire.
Perhaps you’ll also record an album of his stuff later on?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful person and a magnificent musician.
I’ve bumped into him on several occasions and have asked: can I sing this or that song of his?
He responded: “Grigory, I write songs to be performed”.
Please, give it a go and sing them.
I suppose it would also be interesting to record an album like this.
I have no such plans at the moment, but down the road, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn’t mind, I might do a project like this.
That is, if you don’t concentrate entirely on the business of your production center.
I suspect that you haven’t yet realized its potential or signed contracts with all the artists of interest to you?
There’s a whole group of performers that I dream of having under my wing, but they are self-sufficient and accomplished individuals.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Seryozha is a brilliant singer; I invited him to join me.
I might disagree with something in his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
But Alexander Panayotov, whom I mentored in The Voice, is now with my center.
We signed a contract with him and we’re working.
In our pop music scene, singers like him are rare.
It would be a real shame if he falls short of the heights of which he is capable.
I’m trying to select a repertoire for him and film music videos.
I’m hoping for a good outcome.
I’m also trying to promote the other artists with my center: I buy them songs, pay the lyricists, and sometimes their tracks make it into rotation on the television channels and radio stations.
If they don’t reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to its logical conclusion.
At the end of the process, they’ll get a recorded album and several music videos.
After that, they can go their own way if they want, and I won’t insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although, I would be pleased if one of them achieves commercial success and pays me the percentage we agreed to in the contract.
But if this doesn’t happen, I don’t intend to pull the plug on anyone.
Let everyone work, find their way, and prove themselves like I proved myself a long time ago.
If tomorrow you were offered a road tour across Ukraine and they guaranteed entry into the country, would you go?
I still get invited to go there.
Generally, we’re talking about private events.
But in terms of a big tour…
I am a man of my country, a Russian citizen; it was my own choice to fly to Syria on the same airplane that crashed later on.
If tomorrow, they say I need to fly to another place in the interests of the state, I will fly.
And I don’t give a damn what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that we have this type of situation with Ukraine.
As far as I’m concerned, we are one people and we should be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least not in the near future.
But before, I was performing 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
They were welcoming like nowhere else.
They are a very grateful audience.
I also collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik…
There is a multitude of gifted people in Ukraine, and it is truly unfortunate that they are now unable to fully share their talent with the wider Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would be delighted to invite some top-notch Ukrainian performer to Russia, Slava Vakarchuk for example, and hold a joint concert with him.
But I think, at this time, it’s highly unlikely…
Andrei Okhlopkov has been transferred from the cosmodrome
It came to Kommersant’s attention that the technical director for the Vostochny Cosmodrome, Andrei Okhlopkov, has taken on a job at the Khrunichev State Space Research and Production Center (SSRPC).
Previously, he was de facto in charge of building the Vostochny Cosmodrome, but because of disagreements with the management of the Center for the Operation of Space Ground Based Infrastructure (COSGBI), he was transferred to an enterprise in the Fili neighborhood of Moscow, where he will be engaged in coordinating operations.
There won’t be a replacement for Mr. Okhlopkov: the position of technical director will most likely be eliminated and the job responsibilities will be distributed across COSGBI’s divisions.
Kommersant was told about the fact that Vostochny’s technical director and COSGBI’s deputy head for technological development, Andrei Okhlopkov, had transferred to a job with SSRPC by several senior executives of companies in the space industry, as well as by a government staff worker.
“He has been working in the new position for several weeks already”, clarified Kommersant’s industry sources.
It wasn’t possible to get a prompt response from COSGBI on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself was not available for comment.
However, Kommersant’s information was officially confirmed by SSRPC.
He made the decision to transfer to the position of director for the coordination of operations, the enterprise stated. Andrei Okhlopkov, tasked with providing the minimum number of facilities required for the first launch at Vostochny Cosmodrome, fully accomplished this.
Mr. Okhlopkov started working at COSGBI in 2013, having service in the space forces under his belt, specifically at Baikonur and at Plesetsk (at the “northern” cosmodrome, he held the post of deputy commander with the rank of colonel).
In 2009, Andrei Okhlopkov was a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, at his behest, regional businessmen in Arkhangelsk Oblast and Komi Republic were receiving state orders for kickbacks, but they weren’t delivering on their commitments to clean the separable parts of the launch vehicle.
In 2012, a trial by jury found him not guilty.
The responsibilities for the development of technology assigned to him at COSGBI were distributed across various projects, but the most important of them was the construction of the cosmodrome in the Far East.
In an interview with Kommersant, Oleg Ostapenko, who headed up the Federal Space Agency at that time, said frankly that the situation at Vostochny “was already critical in October 2013”.
The fact of the matter is that a strategic mistake was made during planning: the completion of construction and launch of the Soyuz 2.1 launch vehicle were scheduled for the very same time – the end of 2015.
In order to accomplish the launch by the end of the year, they decided to complete construction six months early and deadlines were moved from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, it was necessary to get more than a little bit inventive: COSGBI specialists started the parallel installation of support equipment at facilities that were still under construction.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
In spite of the substantial risks, and the fact that it was postponed anyhow (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz was only launched on April 28, 2016), this idea was justified in and of itself, says a Kommersant source at the cosmodrome: “Otherwise, we still wouldn’t have completed a single launch from Vostochny, but would be engaged in construction”.
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who is overseeing the establishment of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his “space Susanin”, but more often than not, he was requesting information about the pace of construction from him specifically.
Mr. Okhlopkov also stands out in one’s mind for his straightforwardness; for example, in an interview with Kommersant, he suggested stripping the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroi) of its status as the exclusive contractor for Vostochny and working directly with subcontractors: “Why should we put all our eggs in Spetsstroi’s basket?”
This idea found support within the government.
As of 2017, COSGBI took on the duty of principal contractor in order to complete construction and installation work on the launch site and technical facilities by the launch date scheduled for the fourth quarter.
According to Kommersant, the reason for Mr. Okhlopkov’s transfer to a new place of work was a disagreement with COSGBI management about the means for completing construction of the cosmodrome’s facilities and complexes, as well as the methods of working with subcontractors.
“It was decided that it would be better for everyone”, says one of the senior executives involved in the construction of Vostochny.
The government staffer, in turn, calls the decision odd: “He was one of the best experts; it will be difficult to find an equivalent replacement for him”.
According to Kommersant, this won’t be necessary: the position of technical director of the cosmodrome will be eliminated and its functions will be distributed across COSGBI’s divisions.
An educational program with two specializations is coming to music schools
In the future, pupils at children’s music schools will be able to receive two specializations at once.
According to the deputy director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture, Svatoslav Golubenko, in order to achieve this, students will be able to receive credit for courses already taken, while the question of payment for the remaining classes of the second specialization will be resolved with the assistance of special grants, RIA Novosti reports.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken over responsibility for this issue and we, in cooperation with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will make it possible to earn two specializations, but that will not contravene existing legislation in the field of education”, Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin’s “Grown-Up Conversation” with pupils at the Sirius children’s center, Maria Andreeva, a schoolgirl, reported that she is required to pay for duplicate subjects for her second specialization at the Moscow Conservatory’s Central Music School.
The girl said that she is studying violin and piano and has awards from competitions in both disciplines.
The head of state recognized her question as very relevant and promised to help.
A 17-year-old Russian national who scaled the side of a skyscraper has been detained in Mexico
A 17-year-old Russian national, Kirill N., who climbed up the side of a high-rise building onto the roof, has been detained in Mexico, the El Universal website reports.
The incident occurred in the country’s capital, Mexico City.
The youth, with the assistance of two unknown men, climbed over a three-meter fence into the grounds of the Nestle office building complex and climbed up one of its towers on his own.
Moreover, he didn’t use any special equipment, belay, or ropes.
The young man was already on the roof when he was detained.
Officers of the Ministry of Public Safety lowered him to the ground in a helicopter.
Subsequently, he was sent to the National Institute of Migration.
There, they are determining if the youth is in the country legally.
In the meantime, the video with the young man climbing up the high-rise has become popular online.
Users have dubbed the youth, “Spiderman”.
According to the news media, these types of experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.
Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.
Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'
He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.
Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.
However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.
"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.
"I will be happier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me."
The former leaders of Lithuania’s social democrats are persuading them to stay in the ruling coalition
The former chairs of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former prime ministers Algirdas Butkevičius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former speaker of the Seimas from the Social Democrats, Česlovas Juršėnas, urged their fellow party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As Parlamentskaya Gazeta reported, as a result of tensions with their partners –the Farmers and Greens Union – a discussion was initiated in the Social Democratic party about whether to stay in the ruling coalition.
And then, the three experienced senior colleagues appealed to their fellow party members in an open letter, which, in part, reads: “The disappointment of our party colleagues with the results of the election is understandable; however, the coalition with the ‘farmers’ has created for us – albeit not very easy ones, but still – all the conditions for the further realization of the goals of social justice (which, as a result of our initiative, are included in the government’s program) and for preserving the political domination of the center-left parties over the parties of the right”.
According to the former party leaders, so far the discussion “has been predominated by expressions of opinion based on emotions, without concrete arguments”.
The letter’s authors fear that the ill-considered actions of their party could lead to political, economic, and social instability in Lithuania.
A fine has been imposed against the disabled man, Anton Mamayev
The Moscow City Court has mitigated punishment for the wheelchair-bound disabled man, Anton Mamayev, from four and a half years imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
The convicted defendant was released from a pretrial detention facility by an earlier decision of the Timiryazevsky Court.
Having said this, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, since he organized the robbery and theft of a motorized scooter from a former special forces soldier.
The decision of the Moscow City Court reduced Anton Mamayev’s punishment to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
“Mamayev is the mastermind of the robbery, which also constitutes a crime, and as such, this individual should be convicted of a criminal offense”, the press secretary for the Moscow City Court, Ulyana Solopova, explained to Kommersant.
In this case, the court took into account the state of Mamayev’s health, the facts of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition to this, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which a punishment less than the minimum sentence can be imposed.
As for Mamayev’s accomplice, Vasily Seroshtanov, the court didn’t find facts that would have provided grounds for recategorizing the severity of the offense and changing the judgment.
Anton Mamayev himself stated that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I am disappointed with the court’s decision.
The only legitimate decision would have been an acquittal; I intend to keep fighting for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, didn’t rule out an appeal of the judgment in a cassation proceeding through the Moscow City Court and in the Supreme Court.
“We will make use of all the levers of power, right up to the European Court of Human Rights”, he told RIA Novosti.
To recall, the 28-year-old Muscovite, Anton Mamayev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, was the defendant in a criminal case in the fall of last year.
The disabled man contends that he bought the motorized scooter from an acquaintance for 160,000 rubles in order to then sell it.
However, the owners of the motorized scooter, which include a former special forces soldier, stated that the disabled man and his accomplice, Vasily Seroshtanov, took their property from them under the threat of violence.
On June 30, Moscow’s Timiryazevsky District Court sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in a penal colony and Anton Mamayev to four and a half years of imprisonment, with punishment to be served in a standard regime penal colony (in accordance with part 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobile disabled man was placed in a pretrial detention facility, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General’s Office, and the President’s Commissioner for Human Rights, Tatyana Moskalkova, got involved in the case.
As a result, Anton Mamayev was released from the pretrial detention facility in the middle of July, by a decision of the very same Timiryazevsky Court.
The defendant, in turn, disputed the first instance decision in the Moscow City Court.
The All-Russia People’s Front will prepare a report on the environment for the president
The All-Russia People’s Front’s (ONF) final “Action Forum” in 2017 will focus on environmental issues, a source in the ONF reported to Izvestia and the head of the movement’s executive committee, Alexey Anisimov, confirmed.
According to him, based on the results of the forum, members of the front plan to prepare a report for the president on domestic environmental issues, as well as suggest strategies to solve them.
Izvestia’s sources in the ONF note that the report for the head of state will consist of a “deep analysis” of the situation in all of the country’s federal districts.
According to Izvestia, ONF’s final forum will take place in the fall.
The exact date it will be held is still to be determined, but as a rule, it is adjusted to fit the schedule of the president, who is the movement’s leader and traditionally attends the ONF’s major events.
The front held several interregional environmental conferences, one after the other, in two federal districts: in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad, and Kirov.
The final conference will be in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulan-Ude.
We will form comprehensive proposals to solve environmental issues based on the suggestions made and those that will be made at these events, a source in the ONF told Izvestia.
The co-chair of the movement’s central office, Olga Timofeeva, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, reported that members of the front will report to the head of state on the work conducted as part of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The ONF’s final environmental forum and “Action Forum” will most likely be combined.
In span of one year, we have acquired a powerful group of experts in the area of environmental issues, uncovered loopholes in legislation, and put an end to dozens of legal violations.
All of this will go into the report that we are preparing for the president, in his capacity as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, members of the front will also report on work on the ONF’s priority projects, Olga Timofeeva told Izvestia.
According to her, the President’s Special Representative for Environmental Protection, Ecology, and Transport, Sergei Ivanov, will also be invited to the forum.
Previously, he took part in the work of the ONF’s Mediaforum, which was held in Saint Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will be consigned to history, but the most important thing that needs to be done right now is to set in motion environmental protection mechanisms so that they will work for many years to come.
So that these issues remain on the agenda, Olga Timofeeva added.
The head of the regional politics laboratory at the Expert Institute of Social Studies (EISS), Andrey Kolyadin, noted that, by raising environmental issues, the ONF are acting inline with the presidential agenda.
As experts, they have suggested many things in various forums, and these initiatives have received the support of the president, Andrey Kolyadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that, today, it is impossible to ignore the economic potential of the environmental agenda, which might offer the regions an additional impetus for reform.
Down the road, with the assistance of the ONF, regions could lobby not only for a solution to their environmental problems, but also for the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June demonstrated the relevance of environmental issues.
Specifically, the president was asked questions about a waste landfill in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port city of Nakhodka (a bill has already been drafted prohibiting the open handling of coal in populated areas; one of its authors is Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of environmental studies are of the opinion that the legal framework for solving environmental issues in Russia has, by and large, been established: the crux of the matter is continued regulatory enforcement, as well as the position of civil society.
Firm implementation of decisions made by the state is essential, believes the head of the charitable foundation, Ecology for Everyone, Leonid Bochin.
In a conversation with Izvestia, Sergey Tsyplyonkov, a member of the Human Rights Council and head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, underscored that successfully tackling environmental issues will require society and business to make a commitment: legislative efforts on their own are not enough.
As soon as society and business recognize that solving environmental issues is a far more beneficial step in the long term, the situation will change, Sergey Tsyplyonkov noted.
The expert stressed the necessity of overcoming the belief that a violation of environmental legislation is a cost-effective solution for business.
British inventor microchips himself to get into house and car with a wave of hand
A British inventor has become the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, access his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to a medical standard.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted for cats and dogs, and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also alter locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, for a cost of £300 each lock.
The married father of one now has technology fitted to both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.
The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.
"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.
A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."
It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."
Moscow will allocate grants for the emergency care departments of city hospitals
Every year “Saving Lives” grants will be allocated for the emergency care departments and intensive care units of the capital’s medical clinics.
Funds will be spent to incentivize doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the city’s Yudin Clinical Hospital.
During the tour of the clinic, he presented a letter of recognition to orthopedic trauma surgeon Viktor Protsko, under whose direction an extremely difficult operation to reconstruct a teenager’s foot was conducted.
Sergei Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate annual grants to the emergency care departments and intensive care units of the city’s clinics.
Funds will be spent to incentivize doctors and nurses.
According to the capital’s mayor, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is one of the biggest in Moscow today.
Over the past few years, the clinic has received new modern equipment that has enabled its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the site of the Kolomenskaya Village Hospital.
These days, the medical institution’s units are designed to accommodate more than a thousand patients.
In addition to an emergency care department and an inpatient unit, there is also an outpatient care unit here.
The hospital’s staff amounts to 2,800 people.
The total area occupied by the medical clinic is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in a pilot project to set up short-term inpatient care facilities.
They are designed for conducting relatively minor operations.
Advanced medical equipment is used during surgery, which makes it possible to significantly reduce the period of rehabilitation for patients.
After an operation, they only spend a few hours in the hospital.
In just the first six months of this year, inpatient medical care was provided to 36,000 patients at the Yudin Clinical Hospital.
The clinic’s medical staff performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of difficulty.
The NBU has reported a lack of buyers for Sberbank’s Ukrainian “offshoot”
The National Bank of Ukraine has reported an absence of bids to purchase Sberbank’s Ukrainian “offshoot”.
TASS, with reference to the spokesperson for NBU’s press service, reported about this on Friday, August 4.
The NBU confirms that a package of documents from Viktor Prokopenya, a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, for approval of the indirect acquisition (via Paritetbank) of 100% of Sberbank’s shares, was withdrawn on August 3, 2017.
“The NBU has not received paperwork for the purchase of Sberbank’s shares from other potential investors”, it is noted in a statement.
On August 3, the Belarusian businessman, Viktor Prokopenya, withdrew his bid to purchase Sberbank’s subsidiary.
On July 28, it came to light that the National Bank of Ukraine had barred Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov from acquiring Sberbank’s Ukrainian “offshoot”.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that the businessmen didn’t provide the paperwork required to check their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian law.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian “offshoot” to the consortium of Norvik Banka and a private Belorussian company in March of this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium is Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the “offshoots” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among which Sberbank found itself, were introduced in mid-March.
They are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country for the benefit of their parent organizations for a period of one year.
Narcos season 3 trailer: With Pablo Escobar gone, the Cali Cartel take centre stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite season two of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
Season three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the former receiving its first trailer, teasing the show's upcoming villains.
With season three, the DEA has turned their attention towards the richest drug trafficking organisation in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" just with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel's leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) being the brains, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) running the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) based in New York.
The newly released trailer sees Pedro Pascal return as Javier Peña, the character enlisting American and Colombian law enforcement to help with the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe, and Arturo Castro.
Season three of Narcos will debut 1 September.
Afghan democracy depends on political role for women, U.N. says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the U.N. Assistance Mission said hundreds of women are running in provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly-registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible when women fully participate and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections take place April 5.
The Taliban has issued threats against an election process that coincides with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year's elections mark the first time power is handed peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will add to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports 1.2 million women are registered out of 3.6 million total registered voters.
The Prosecutor General’s Office has approved an indictment in the Nikita Belykh case
The Office of the Prosecutor General of Russia has approved an indictment in the criminal case against the former governor of Kirov Oblast, Nikita Belykh, who is accused of taking large bribes.
The government agency announced this on Thursday, August 3, RIA Novosti reports.
The files have been handed over to Moscow’s Presnensky District Court for consideration on the merits.
The fines for inappropriate conduct by tourists in Venice have been stiffened
Venice’s authorities have stiffened the fines for swimming in the canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
From now on, they will issue a fine of 200 euros for walking around the city in a bathing suit or bare-chested.
Those who set up a picnic in a public place or go for a bicycle ride in pedestrian areas will be forced to pay 100 euros, TASS reports, with reference to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
Additionally, it is mentioned that the authorities specify a fine of 400 euros for graffiti on monuments and 25 euros for littering.
Tourists will be informed of the need to follow the rules of conduct by means of a special awareness campaign, #EnjoyRespectVenezia, on social networks, and also through announcements and banners on the city council’s website, on billboards, and in places with the greatest concentration of tourists.
The awareness campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to Venice’s advisor for tourism, Paola Mar, data on fines will be sent to the embassies of the home countries of the violators in order to warn their fellow citizens against similar mistakes.
“The problem is that Venice is thought of like a beach”, she noted.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the flow of tourists.
In Venice, restrictions on the number of tourists visiting the city’s center are already successfully working.
Instead of the 100,000 people wanting to observe the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 visitors were admitted to the event site.
Furthermore, a moratorium on the establishment of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice has been put in place.
In the first half of 2017, State Border Guard Service officers detained 272 illegals on the border with EU countries; in total, 1,059 illegal migrants were detained.
The State Border Guard Service reported this.
Three hundred and fourteen of them were detained for illegally crossing the border, and the rest for violating residency regulations for foreigners living in Ukraine and for other offences.
The largest figure: 717 illegal migrants were detained on the border with Moldova.
Two hundred and seventy-two illegals were detained on the border with EU countries, the majority of them on the border with Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Romania.
According to statistics, it is primarily citizens of Moldova, Russia, Georgia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, and Armenia who are among the detained illegal migrants.
In addition to this, more than 2 thousand potential illegal migrants were refused entry into Ukraine.
Let us remember that the EU found an unusual method for getting rid of migrants.
Jazz at Skolkovo: experimentation and improvisation
The program for the second Skolkovo Jazz Science festival, which will take place on August 26 at the Skolkovo Innovation Center, has been announced.
Visitors can expect performances by leading jazz groups and soloists, scientific discussions, interactive installations, and other musical and intellectual activities.
The organizers promise that the venue will become an area for improvisation and a space for demonstrating new creative possibilities.
“Festival visitors will be able to delve into the world of experimental media technology and discover how innovations in science are turning into new tools of collaboration with art”, Yelena Zelentsova, Vice President of the Skolkovo Foundation, described as the focus of the forum.
There are more than a few stars among the Skolkovo Jazz Science 2017 participants, including Igor Butman’s Moscow Jazz Orchestra, which will perform a joint program with vocalist Yaroslava Simonova.
Jazz and science are related concepts and it is no accident that they were connected, the people’s artist explained to Izvestia.
Jazz musicians value experimentation and improvisation as highly as scientists.
One of the main events of the festival will be a performance by Azekel, a British citizen of Nigerian descent, who is known for both his own body of work and for his collaborative work with the legendary Massive Attack and Gorillaz.
Jazz lovers are eagerly awaiting the first performance in Russia by the five-time Grammy nominated pianist, Christian Sands (USA), with his trio.
One of the best academic chamber orchestras, Musica Viva, will try its hand in a new format, under the direction of Alexander Rudin and with the participation of pianist Yury Favorin.
The Marimba Plus ensemble and its leader, composer, and marimba player, Lev Slepner, will demonstrate a fusion of jazz, ethnic, and electronic music, as well as academic traditions.
One of the most unusual festival performances promises to be the set by Sergei Kuryokhin award winner, Anton Maskeliadze.
The experimental artist conducts music and video using gestures: this is how leap motion technology works.
In total, eight musical groups will perform on two festival stages.
Additionally, the program includes open discussions, interactive zones, and art installations, united by the idea of merging music and science.
Visitors will be able to take part in experiments, visit a science buffet, and observe cryogenic ice cream or quicksand, made from cornstarch and water, being created.
In a special vinyl area, it will be possible to purchase records from current jazz performers and representatives of other music genres; while, at the book fair, there will be publications on various subjects, including music, popular science, and biomedical literature.
The Federation Council has relieved Ozerov from the post of committee head
On Wednesday, the Federation Council approved the resignation letter of the chairperson for the Committee on Defense and Security, Viktor Ozerov, and relieved him of this post.
He remains the senator for Khabarovsk Krai.
Ozerov wrote the application requesting to be relieved from his current post last week.
He explained his decision as a requirement of the rotation and owing to his desire to “change the pace of life”.
The senator also noted that the decision to resign wasn’t made in the spur of the moment.
Viktor Ozerov has represented the Legislative Assembly of Khabarovsk Krai in the Federation Council of the Russian Federation since 1996.
The senator has led the Committee on Defense and Security since 2001.
Electricity is getting cheaper for both residents and manufacturers in Buryatia
The decades-long efforts of Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for consumers of electric energy are beginning to pay off.
Starting on September 1, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial users will be reduced by 25%.
The country’s Federal Antimonopoly Service has set indicative prices for electricity and capacity for industrial consumers in the Republic of Buryatia, in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation “On amendments to the rules of the wholesale market of electric energy and capacity and the consolidated balance forecast for production and delivery of electric energy (capacity), within the framework of the Unified Energy System of Russia, for constituent entities of the Russian Federation” (from 17.07.2017, No. 842).
As a consequence, the cost of electric energy for Buryat manufacturers is being reduced by a quarter, which will make life significantly easier for small and medium businesses and individual entrepreneurs.
The republic’s leaders have been knocking on office doors in Moscow for many decades in futile attempts to equalize the region’s tariffs with those of the neighboring Irkutsk region: with its chain of hydroelectric stations on the Angara River that flows from Lake Baikal, for which Buryatia is the main catchment area.
But progress has only started to be made this year.
In March, tariffs on electric energy for the republic’s population were reduced from RUB 4.24/kWh to RUB 3.93/kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the decision of the federal government to include Buryatia on the list of territories of wholesale market pricing zones, for which specific aspects of the functioning of the wholesale and retail markets are established, the time has come for industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of Irkutsk region pays 1.01 rubles per kilowatt-hour.
But no one is daring to name even a rough date for the downward shift in new tariffs for Buryatia.
Scooter wasn’t frightened by the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine and flew to Crimea
The group Scooter, a legend of electronic dance music, flew to Crimea unafraid of the threats from the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine.
“The flight went well, and tomorrow, I will hold a concert”, RIA Novosti quotes the group’s frontman, H.P. Baxxter, as saying.
Earlier, the German publication Bild, with reference to the Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Evgeny Enin, reported that the musicians could face up to eight years imprisonment for travelling to Crimea, which Kiev considers as the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine.
Scooter’s performance at the festival in Balaklava, which is called #ZBFest, is planned for August 4.
#ZBFest is put on by the Zolotaya Balka company, in honor of International Champagne Day.
Scooter, founded in 1993, is one of Germany’s most famous groups.
Their last album, “Ace”, came out in 2016.
Besides Scooter, Sergei Galanin and his group SerGa, as well as Garik Sukachev with Brigada S, will also perform as festival guests.
The premiere of the new season of “Game of Thrones” will take place in the Moscow Metro
The Russian premiere of the seventh season of “Game of Thrones” will take place in the capital’s metropolitan.
Komsomolskaya Pravda’s website writes about this.
It’s known that the first episode will be shown on the night of July 18 at one of the stations, as a part of the “Night in the Metro” promotion.
Visitors will be met in the entrance hall by actors dressed as White Walkers, with the series’ soundtrack playing in the background.
Furthermore, anybody who wants will be able to take a picture with a replica of the iron throne, which will be placed on the platform.
According to the first deputy head of the Moscow Metropolitan, Roman Latypov, the underground screening of the series, which will be the first in history, will help the audience to better experience what is happening on the screen.
GMB concern over investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.
It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Putin announced that the authorities will not issue instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers should be involved in the issue of gas deliveries to the Far East Petrochemical Company (FEPCO), but that no one will be issuing instructions to either Gazprom or Rosneft.
This is how Russian President Vladimir Putin replied to Igor Sechin’s request to assist in resolving conflicts that have emerged.
The head of state drew attention to the fact that the relationship between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting concerning the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, stated that the absence of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for FEPCO put the timetable for the implementation of the project at risk.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue is ongoing.
“Gazprom proposes finding gas resources from within Rosneft’s operational perimeter, but we don’t have these types of resources”, Sechin added.
You will recall that Rosneft was asking for permission to use gas from Gazprom’s Kirinskoye field, located on the Sakhalin shelf, for the Far East Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom announced that negotiations on this matter continue, and that “there aren’t any contentious issues”.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.
Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.
Putin has instructed that payments to victims of the forest fires be dealt with.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed that the financial assistance, which is being allocated to resident-victims of the forest fires and for the construction of new homes, be dealt with.
Today, I would like to hear how work is progressing.
In particular, I am asking for a report on how things stand in terms of compensation paid to affected citizens.
I am hearing some conflicting information.
“This is why I would like to ask the relevant colleagues about how much money has been dispensed”, Putin stated at a meeting with the heads of the regions located in Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Nature Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the Plenipotentiary Representative of Russian President for the Siberian Federal District, Sergey Meniailo, and the head of the Baikal branch of the Federal State Budgetary Institution, Glavrybvod, Leonid Mikhailik.
They spoke about efforts to clean up the lake.
Then, they showed the fry in an open tank beside a container they had prepared for breeding.
First, Putin released several fry from a net.
Then, he pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and released the rest of them.
During the trip, the leader also instructed that the environmental situation in Baikal be dealt with and that a road be built on Olkhon Island.
According to Ministry of Construction figures, a certain amount is needed, but allegedly, a different amount has been set aside.
“To be blunt, I want to get to the bottom of what is going on with the financing here”, the Russian leader stressed.
You’ll remember that, during the 2017 forest fires, populated areas in Buryatia and Irkutsk Oblast were engulfed in flames and homes and outbuildings were destroyed.
Ukraine has suggested sending Russian nationals to prison for illegally crossing the border
Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada has registered a bill according to which Russian nationals could face criminal sanction in the republic for illegally crossing the Ukrainian border.
As RT television channel reports, the document, registered in the electronic database of the Ukrainian parliament, stipulates a three-year prison sentence for citizens of Russia trying to get into the country’s territory illegally.
It is noted that the term of imprisonment can be increased to five years for repeat offenses or for an act committed by a group of individuals.
If, however, the offender has been detained on the border with a weapon, then the period of detention for them will increase to eight years.
Earlier, it was reported that Ukrainian border guards had detained Ukrainians trying to get into Russia outside of the established checkpoints.
Magnit has gone into wholesale
The second largest food retailer in terms of revenue, Magnit, announced the opening of three new format test stores, Magnit-Opt, which are designed for small wholesale purchasing.
Moreover, it will still be possible to purchase goods at retail prices, a company press release states.
These new format stores have opened for business in Krasnodar, Saratov, and Ulyanovsk.
Their product range consists of around 1,500 food and non-food product items.
“This new service will enable companies and business owners to make financially advantageous purchases, and residents to stock up on products: for a week or a month”, Magnit assures.
Metro Cash & Carry and Selgros Cash & Carry are already operating in the small-scale wholesale segment.
In 2017, Lenta launched the special program, Lenta Pro: it offered legal entities and independent business owners the ability to make purchases at the big box store’s special checkouts, and receive an invoice for cost accounting and VAT reimbursement.
The project is aimed at the HORECA segment, small retail, and offices.
There will be two new priority social and economic development areas in Russia: Abaza and Novotroitsk.
The corresponding Russian Government Decree will come into force today, August 4.
The borders and types of economic activities of the priority development area in the town of Abaza in the Republic of Khakassia have been established.
In the town, which is home to 15,000 people, a special regulatory regime for entrepreneurial activity will be in effect, as well as a minimum amount of capital investment from residents, and a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
It is anticipated that this will attract approximately 2.5 billion rubles of investment into the town, and also that more than 600 new jobs will be created.
The list of types of economic activities, according to which the Abaza priority development area’s special regulatory regime for entrepreneurial activity will be in effect, includes, for example, crop farming, livestock breeding, and the production of food products, non-alcoholic beverages, and clothing.
So far, the republic’s government has already signed framework agreements for the implementation of 8 investment projects.
There are also plans to reduce the area’s dependence on the town’s economic mainstay, OOO Abakan Mining Company.
In January 2017, regional authorities announced that Khakassia had met all of the Ministry of Economic Development’s conditions to create the priority development area.
The government of Orenburg Oblast also acted in a similar manner.
There, in the town of Novotroitsk, a priority social and economic development area will also be created.
This will make it possible to diversify the economy of the single-industry town and reduce its dependence on the town’s economic mainstay, JSC Ural Steel, as well as create more than 2,300 jobs and attract investments in the amount of more than 8 billion rubles.
The list of types of economic activities, according to which the priority development area’s special regulatory regime for business operators will be in effect, includes, for example, freshwater fish farming and the manufacture of feed, medications, and medical materials.
Novotroitsk was the first single-industry town in Orenburg Oblast to receive the priority development area status.
To recap, a priority development area is an economic zone with tax incentives, simplified administrative procedures, and other privileges, which are established to attract investment and improve the lives of the population.
Some of the benefits for residents of a priority development area include the following: a profit tax of no more than 5% during the first five years and no more than 10% in the 5 following years, social security contributions in the amount of 7.6% for 10 years, use of the duty-free zone regime, preferential conditions for connecting to various infrastructure facilities, and preferential rates for rent.
Loza called Manson “scum” and threatened to “punch him in the face”
Yury Loza has expressed his indignation at a remark made by American rock musician Marilyn Manson, who insulted Moscow.
In an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Russian singer called Manson a “bastard” and “scum”.
According to Loza, foreign artists who allow themselves to make such statements shouldn’t be invited to Russia.
Furthermore, Loza believes that Manson needs to get “punched in the face” for his words.
You’ll recall that the American artist, infamous for his inflammatory behavior, spoke rudely about the Russian capital at a concert in Kiev.
Earlier on Thursday, Argumenty Nedeli wrote that domestic producer Josef Prigozhin had commented on Manson’s statement.
In Moscow, a police officer injured a man in the leg while defending against an assault
A police officer shot a party to a fight in Moscow in the leg after that individual came after him with a piece of glass in his hand.
On the evening of August 3, the police station of the Department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for Yakimanka District received a report about a fight at 46 Mytnaya Street.
“The attending police squad put an end to the lawlessness and separated the parties to the conflict”, RIA Novosti reported, with reference to the press service of the capital’s head office for the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
According to the police, when one of the parties to the conflict came after a police officer with a piece of glass, the police officer warned the man several times that he would use his weapon and fired a warning shot.
This didn’t stop the hooligan, whereupon the law enforcement officer shot the man in the leg.
The injured man required hospitalization.
Welsh AMs worried about 'looking like muppets'
There is consternation among some AMs at a suggestion their title should change to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are worried it could invite ridicule.
One Labour AM said his group was concerned "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh twp means daft and pwp means poo.
A Plaid AM said the group as a whole was "not happy" and has suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open minded" about the name change, but noted it was a short verbal hop from MWP to Muppet.
In this context The Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what Assembly Members are called will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which found broad support for calling the assembly a Welsh Parliament.
On the matter of the AMs' title, the Commission favoured Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in a public consultation.
AMs are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians go to polls in referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up in a bid to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will disregard the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The Bells of St. Martin's Fall Silent as Churches in Harlem Struggle
"Historically, the old people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there's neither."
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People socialize in a different way" nowadays, he said.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people go on a regular basis."
As for churches, he worries that the money from selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect it to, "and sooner or later they'll be right back where they started."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining sanctuaries.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will hasten the day that these churches close altogether because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been worshiping nearby took title to the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild, they commissioned the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has played out at St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the parish's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would seek to pass along the costs" to the vestry, even though the vestry had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent in.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the diocese's part.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was diving for lobster in California on the opening day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then paddled over with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just excitement of catching a lobster, but then he "realized that he was yelling, 'I got bit!
I got bit!'
His whole clavicle was ripped open," Hammel said he noticed once he got to the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added the victim sustained traumatic injuries to his upper torso area.
Officials shut down beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans push into UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is taking on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty aisles staffed with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial push into the UK's £2.8bn beauty market, which is continuing to grow while fashion and homeware sales fall back, the larger beauty aisles will be tested out in 11 stores around the country and taken to more stores next year if it proves a success.
The investment in beauty comes as supermarkets hunt for ways to use up shelf space once sued for TVs, microwaves and homeware.
Sainsbury's said it would be doubling the size of its beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop will be testing out concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week while a second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said the outlets will look increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has bolstered grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist's stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago.
It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every need and the alluring environment and convenient locations mean we're now a compelling beauty destination which challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left 'furious' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The pair's business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning presenter, 37, took to Instagram to announce she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons" Den star Peter Jones fuming by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own new bumper contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when TV's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
As Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly, Jones jetted out of Britain to head for one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far the top of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be her long-term future that would see her through the next couple of decades.
Her decision to pull out left everyone involved absolutely stunned.
Nobody could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow HQ which are ready to be sold."
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is among Britain's most bankable stars, could cost the firm millions due to hefty investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and the potential for further delays to its launch.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother-of-three Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples holiday together and Jones has a 40 per cent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We wouldn't comment on his business affairs."
Tough talk 'and then we fell in love'
He joked about criticism he would get from the news media for making a comment some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his mock "news anchor" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly Saturday that the North doesn't see a "corresponding response" from the U.S. to North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping up pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - ending rocket tests, helping free hostages and getting the remains of American servicemen returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing at the crowd directly in front of him.
Indonesia Tsunami and Quake Devastate an Island, Killing Hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for instance, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Even though more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had been dislocated, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've been very clear that they're not requesting international assistance, so it's a bit challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the national disaster agency spokesman, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Given the earth shaking that Indonesia constantly endures, the country remains woefully underprepared for nature's wrath.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though a warning had been in effect, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At the best of times, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's tattered infrastructure a centerpiece of his election campaign, and he has lavished money on roads and railways.
But funding shortfalls have plagued Mr. Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands dislocated from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battled on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other crude weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge dips deep equalizer vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while about 30 yards out from the Chelsea goal with his team trailing 1-0.
He tapped the ball to his left before scooping a shot toward the far post.
The attempt sailed high above the box as it drifted toward the right top corner of the net.
The ball eventually dropped over a leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to get on the ball and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and took one touch and didn't think about it too much and just took the shot on."
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after getting a score in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker heeled a pass back to Mateo Kovacic on that play, before spinning off near midfield and sprinting into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic did a quick give-and-go at midfield.
He then fired a beautiful through ball, leading Hazard into the box.
Hazard outran the defense and finished into the far post netting with a left footed shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool battles Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has climbed to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings brought down in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake which struck Friday and triggered waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was strewn with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55am with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man being arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages but I would appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also appeal to anyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have captured anything on dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information which is vital to our investigation.'
A police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was found is local to Birkenhead and she was found inside a property.
This afternoon friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police have said they are in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back into his flat but is being told by police no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what happened.
Residents are now being told it will be hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
She keeps repeating 'it's so awful'.
At 2pm two police vans were inside the cordon with another van just outside.
A number of officers were stood inside the cordon monitoring the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting log 247 of 30th September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit by 'rewriting history' row
Its banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as "folly" and "attempting to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure who many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a wholly accurate representation is the subject of continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Killer Pig Mauls Chinese Farmer to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a sty at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a hoggery on May 30, 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The following morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to a neighbouring pig sty open.
He said that in the sty was a large male pig with blood on its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550 pound hog had mauled the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mangled," the cousin, referred to by his surname "Wu," said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Though rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years previously, a 650 pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
"They're just being playful.
They're nippers, very inquisitive ... they aren't out to hurt you.
You just have to pay them the right amount of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remnants to bring widespread heavy rain to southwest US
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rains across northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 Hurricane, as of 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is beginning to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move east toward the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm it will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash flooding, debris flows and possibility landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in spots, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Flash flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely ill advised to venture out into the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain could cause canyons to become raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring locally gusty winds and blowing dust.
The approaching trough will bring some locally heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Rainfall totals of over half an inch are possible, which could cause minor debris flows and slick roadways.
This would be the region's first rainfall of their wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread into the Four Corners on Tuesday and last through Wednesday.
October can see some intense temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a great example of dramatic temperature differences through the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is nearly a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, lingering summer warmth will try to build and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm start to October with widespread 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long term climate forecast is indicating high chances for above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's gripping testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political standoff continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute twist: an agreement engineered by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh groped her drunkenly and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in impassioned testimony, said he's 100 percent certain that it didn't happen.
It's likely that more than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched it.
The company was counting average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures weren't immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices.
To put that in perspective, that's an audience size similar to that for a playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts have strongly backed Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would be voting in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught be CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being shouted at by protesters as he tried to ride an elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with eyes downcast for several minutes as he was berated, televised live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "you have power when so many women are powerless.""
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks were all covering live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the nominee for the next week, which minority Democrats have been urging.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, because it was evident Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to the one with her on the newspaper's front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack of her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "entirely preposterous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and booked into prison on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to fatally shooting Wayde.
His bond has been set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head into the neck.
The department is crediting the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and area citizens in assisting in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for its "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about at all times," Wade said.
Volcano spews ash on Mexico City
Ash spewing from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater and it registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center was monitoring multiple rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash coating car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano that sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police pelted them with eggs and hurled powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that would usually be thronged with tourists.
Scuffles also broke out later in the day with police using their batons to contain the fighting.
Over several hours pro-independence groups chanting "No forgetting, no forgiveness" faced off with unionist protesters shouting, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests, local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters chose overwhelmingly to become independent, though turnout was low with those against secession largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote going ahead at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration went ahead but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we lived through one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy at being able to vote but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite managing a vital if narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to retain momentum this year with many of their best known leaders either in self imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic recording the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial jail since late last year, announced he would run in European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house rammed by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga strike gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Promoted Livingston stunned Rangers to consign Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference as Gary Holt's side moved level with Hibernian in second.
Gerrard's side remain without an away win in the Premiership this season and face leaders Hearts, who they trail by eight points, next Sunday.
Before then, Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston miss chances against blunt visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their directness causing Rangers all manner of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his effort across the face of goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his effort wide after sliding in to meet Craig Halkett's header across goal.
The hosts were content to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could trouble the visitors at set pieces.
And that was the manner in which the crucial goal came.
Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston worked an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining to set up Menga, who took a touch and scored from the centre of the box.
By that stage, Rangers had dominated possession but had found the home defence impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely untroubled,
That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos did force a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow flicked wide from another Livingston set play.
Crosses continually came into the Livingston box and were continually cleared, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were waved away.
'Phenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and personnel has scarcely changed since their return to the top flight, but great credit has to go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, marshalling a superbly-organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
Rangers were short of inspiration, though.
As good as they have been at times under Gerrard, they fell well short of those standards.
Their final ball was lacking - only once did they cut the home side open - and it is something of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in mid-table.
Erdogan get mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at repairing relations beteen the NATO allies.
They've fallen out over issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but plenty of supporters turned out nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The dueling protests reflect the divisiveness of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and reviled as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road crash: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision involving a car in London.
The crash happened near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics attended, but the man died at the scene.
The crash comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his next-of-kin.
Road closures and bus diversions are in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers hurt in disorder
Six prison officers have been injured in a disturbance at a high security men's jail, the Prison Office has said.
Disorder broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involves eight inmates and is contained to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June it was reported that the prison's governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flash Flooding (Drought Areas May Benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy tracks across the Desert Southwest, delivering flash flooding risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct path over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals up to 4 inches possible.
For those out of flash flood risk, Rosa's rain may be a blessing since the region is drought-stricken.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this rainfall will likely be beneficial since the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to landfall across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore powering down.
Thus, it's expected to make landfall in Mexico at tropical storm strength in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rainfall across portions of Mexico could be heavy, posing a significant flooding risk.
"Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then track north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then track up through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main hazard expected from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce life-threatening flash flooding and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four attempted murder arrests
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officers have appealed for anyone who may have any mobile phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered, the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegation.
The President said on Saturday that the "American people saw the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with a sterling record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President obliquely referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian quake, tsunami, with toll seen rising
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away as giant waves crashed onto beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying anything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before striking the shoreline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in statement the energy released by Friday's massive quake was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War Two.
The geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and the damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications "were totally crippled with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," it said.
The agency on Saturday was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water crashes onto the shore, carrying away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending in cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still badly need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia Tsunami Toll Soars Above 800.
It Is Very Bad.
While World Vision's staff from Donggala have made it safely to Palu city, where employees are sheltering in tarpaulin shelters set up in the courtyard of their office, they passed scenes of devastation on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw lots of houses that were destroyed," he said.
It is very bad.
Even as aid groups began the grim motions of starting the gears of disaster relief, some complained that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staffing from overseas can only start flowing if the site of a calamity is declared a national disaster zone.
That has not happened yet.
"It's still a province level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can open for international assistance but there's no status yet."
As the second night fell on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing were holding out hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that leaven the bleak story lines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was plucked from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been pinned under rubble for two days with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which wrapped up earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse circulated among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who were taking part in the beach festival.
His messages, though, only resulted in one gray check mark, rather than a pair of blue checks.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The car's driver had been emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
While he was occupied, another man "ran up from behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money meant for delivery.
Witnesses spotted multiple suspects fleeing the scene, according to the release, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show who cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
As well as being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye - just being a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers to change their name.
Sean Combs has been variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has also made do with or without a hyphen and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never ever use the military to repress the Mexican people."
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration at the plaza on Oct. 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities draws youth to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, even as the U.S. overall lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it's aiming to be No.1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so much farther behind U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard in order to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that is taking away the academic leaders; it's the corporates," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said immigration policy changes could also help the U.S. bolster its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should automatically be offered to PhD's in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations dole out money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is meant to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen action in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which had blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entrance into NATO and the EU.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not be voting in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubts on whether turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to pursue admission into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so they can be live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the vote's outcome to make it decisive.
The name change would requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, turnout stood at only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters cast their ballot.
"I came out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their ballot for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that would open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and pulling up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the service door" Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we do have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the huge majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He said that a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful turnout needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first serious blow to policy of the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through entire Brighton defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling dispatched of the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass at midfield at the start of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, before slashing into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one defender before outrunning several more at the edge of the Brighton box.
He then pushed a pass to his left, finding Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We spoke about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal in that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League scuffle.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in Brighton territory on that play.
He sent a beautiful through ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling toward the far post.
The Sky Blues forward tapped the ball into the net just before sliding out of bounds.
City battles Hoffenheim in Champions League group play at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler vs. Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there wasn't much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched at least a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock up their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to toe the rubber knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team would be playing at probably the highest level of any point I would face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be making his 34th start, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and would be pitching on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
The President obliquely referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"All of what we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by using any means necessary, you see the meanness, the nastiness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And you see that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and nasty and untruthful."
He referenced Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein by name, which received loud boos from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I wait one - that was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant of those who speak their minds
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censure me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I'm the latest in a line of Labour MPs to be told we are not welcome - all for speaking our minds.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely stood up to antisemitism.
In my case, the censure motion criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the Friday night GC meetings have been exactly that.
Sadly today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics has long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.
It has become increasingly apparent that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared a similar political outlook began expecting me to do a U-turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed with - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there follows a tirade of abuse on social media calling for deselection, denouncing the politics of the centre, telling me I should not be in the Labour party.
And that is not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues as the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normalised.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is we are no longer that broad church and with every "no-confidence" motion or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower.
I have had lots of advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so vocal and then I would "be all right."
But that is not what I came into politics to do.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literally falling down, I've sought to champion better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I would say is that when the country is ploughing towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But really the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of deselection threats or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I believe are the best interests of you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr go top
Two late tries may have skewed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully-entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They now top the table, the only unbeaten side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defence, as much as their better chance-taking, which carried the home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"We've been tested over our games this far, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Credit to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to make numbers tell and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted try.
Climo stretched the Ayr lead with a penalty, before, right on half-time, he scored then converted a solo try to make it 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the leeway to five points.
There was then a lengthy hold-up for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was stretchered off, and from the restart, Ayr surged further ahead through a Stafford McDowall try, converted by Climo.
Ayr acting captain Blair Macpherson was then yellow-carded, and again, Melrose made the extra man pay with an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a spell of fierce pressure.
The home side came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was yellow-carded for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down at the back of the advancing Ayr maul.
Climo converted, as he did again almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry away for the home side's fifth try.
Still Game star looks set for new career in restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran looks set to move into the hospitality industry after it was discovered he's been named as the director of a licensed restaurants company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final one in the show's run, and it appears Kiernan is planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official record listings, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was looking to get involved in Glasgow's "thriving restaurant trade."
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to Pacific
Sailors patrol a rigging-clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly an ocean-blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are daubed with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty."
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still vivid - as is the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.
Those hopes are perhaps at their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and is of course expecting with a positive view the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hopeful that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of fitful talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has plenty riding on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's favour - and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ICJ's ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates the case "wasn't complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from furthering Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have set it back.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales's belligerent rhetoric has sapped any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually speedy.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless it can trust US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow through on promises made during a summit in Singapore between the rivals' leaders.
His comments come as US. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "pipe dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first making significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest line in massive headwear on it's way to a High Street near you
If you want to upsize your hat collection or completely block out the sun then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled an array of wacky oversized head gear for their SS19 collection on the runway which dazzled the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-popping creations down the catwalk.
The stand out piece by Valentino was an over-the-top beige hat adorned with a feather-like wide brim that swamped the models heads.
Other over-sized accessories included bejeweled watermelons, a wizard hat and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks- and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn up lips and resembled more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled scuba diving gear complete with snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue the huge fashion statement- you are in luck.
Style watchers predict that the enormous bonnets could be making their way to high streets near you.
The out-sized hats come hot on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide brim that's been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that was splashed across social media sent another big creation down the catwalk - a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model toting it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringing and topped with a white leather handle, was the stand out piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I'm expecting to see large hats and beach bags arrive on the high street for next summer - as the designer has made such a huge impact it would be hard to ignore the demand for the oversized accessories.'
John Edward: Languages skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavours.
With upwards of 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a bespoke school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages continue as a popular and desired subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language that goes to his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when wanting to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are topping the league tables with the highest pass rates within independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a Higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent studying Spanish also achieved an A.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future.
Languages now, as a subject choice, are being held in the same regard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a languages skills shortage.
Therefore more and more, language skills are becoming imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they've learned a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future having a life-long skill such as this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 per cent.
This is why putting the investment into language teaching now is important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, particularly those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, whereas others will teach languages that are deemed to be most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills required to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It can't be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vitally important to the country's future, so this must be mirrored in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to make Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is nearly over for fans looking to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But just how many minutes he'll play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers" official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers" six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a flurry of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallies in the next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote on hold for his pick to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to build support for upcoming mid-term elections since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast on Nov.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which became tense over sexual misconduct allegations with an anticipated Senate confirmation vote on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary aim of this flurry of rallies is helping Republicans facing touch November elections gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said these five rallies in the next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show stomach for fight to keep hopes alive heading into Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes might just have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept but one that players truly believe in, and never more so than at competitions like these.
So where would they say the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we are carrying that as a little bit of momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he strolled off for the day.
Europe have the advantage, of course, four points ahead with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in their sails though and they have plenty to be encouraged by, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boast three points from four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those guttural screams of celebration got louder as his round went on, sinking a crucial putt to take match four all-square when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His putt that won them the match on 15 was met with a similar scream, the sort that tells you he believes that the American team is not out of this.
"You've really just got to dig deep and worry about your own match," Spieth said.
It is all each of these players has left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's odd but adorable couple are four from four and can do no wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this boisterous crowd cements that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
Talk of European glory remains premature, though.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short work of Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never got close to climbing out of.
On Sunday, though, there is nobody to help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between pairings, the advice they give, the advice they don't and the way that a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe have played better as a team thus far and take a significant lead into the final day but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the stomach for the fight that some, especially Stateside, had been doubting.
Europe take 10-6 lead into Ryder Cup final day
Europe will take a healthy advantage into the final day of the Ryder Cup after emerging from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their tally so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, bidding to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misfiring American side in the morning fourballs, taking the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but they could not eat into the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then gelled superbly to beat a deflated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not have it al their own way though on a pleasant, breezy day south west of Paris.
Three-times major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They earned a gritty 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes having lost the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit going into the singles, although as holders Furyk's side need only draw to retain the trophy.
After being second-best for two days, however, a Sunday counter-attack looks as though it will be beyond them.
North Korea says 'no way' will disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust in the United States and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missiles tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri reprised familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first ever summit between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "denuclearization-first" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even objecting to the "declaration of the end of war,"" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the U.S., the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, heaped praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the fully, final, verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to denounce him for making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding measures."
He said Kim had told him the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take course in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has got all its undergraduates getting more sleep in a bid to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-fuelled 'all-nighters.'
An academic found students at the world's number one university are often clueless when it comes to the very basics about how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
'At the end of it one girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I only being told this now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
The hour long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is impacted by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behaviour instantly.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' Prof Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in 'pulling an all-nighter' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring you have enough sleep, of a good quality, should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, it to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as for when to wake, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can throw your circadian rhythm out of kilter, leading to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal downs Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another bout of away-day blues as Dolly Menga's strike consigned Steven Gerrard's disjointed side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted just Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points adrift of runaway Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked like levelling.
While Rangers now drop down to sixth spot, Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be further trouble in store for Rangers after linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the away end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side which swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 which took a point off Hearts last week and he would have been delighted with the way his well-drilled outfit suffocated their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored just two minutes in when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder tugged his big chance wide.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only stab wide at the back post.
Rangers did grab control but there looked to be more hope than belief about their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have had a penalty on the quarter-hour mark as he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's appeals.
Rangers managed just two first-half shots on target but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame Ovie Ejaria strike.
While Livi's 34th-minute opener may have been against the run of play, no one can deny they deserved it for their graft alone.
Again Rangers failed to deal with a deep Jacobs set-piece.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher slotted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break as he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the switch almost provided an immediate impact as the winger slotted in Morelos but the impressive Kelly raced from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to suck the visitors into playing exactly the type of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood up well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty as he tangled with Jacobs but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and COUNTING ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
A mainstay of science ever since, the Geiger Counter became a pop culture mainstay as well, as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado," starring those seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given off by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say, it sure is popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days short of his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' rogue cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' rogue cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognise rogue cells as part of treatment
Method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in lab
They can then 'see' a protein common to many cancers and then reinjected
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise rogue cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West Embarked on a Pro-Trump Diatribe, Wearing a MAGA Hat, After his SNL Appearance.
It Didn't Go Well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a rambling performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town in which he was wearing a Make America Great cap, he went on a rant against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white person and they say: "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism I would've moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a skit starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's rant was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock was trying to mock West with the posting.
Also, West had complained to the audience that he had got a hard time backstage about his head wear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'don't go out there with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on: "You wanna see the sunken place?" saying that he would "put my superman cape on, because this means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments drew boos at least twice from the audience and SNL cast members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The entire studio fell dead silent."
West had been brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West got backing from head of conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE MOB."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by purchasing his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe is embracing and spewing ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the being formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change their name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge over Belfast restaurant stabbing
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington hits out at toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has hit out at the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such roles on screen mean young boys often feel like they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something's gone wrong' and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he feels 'quite strongly' about addressing the issue.
'I feel personally, quite strongly, at the moment - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?,' he said.
'What have we been teaching men when they're growing up, in terms of the problem we see now?'
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued: 'What's innate and what's taught?
What is taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes young boys feel they have to be this certain side of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that?
Because clearly something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he wouldn't be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he is 'done with battlefields and horses'.
From November Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on in,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% surge in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens who are living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year-on-year, however, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the issue.
Maxine Waters denies staffer leaked GOP senators' data, blasts 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators onto the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat asserted that the claims were being pedaled by "ultra-right wing" pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel's hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters" office and released the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests she doesn't have the temperment to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must be calm and serene."
Fleischer was appearing to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"Big if true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally liable for all of their actions that are destructible and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - underpowered Rowan Atkinson spy spoof
It's traditional now to look for Brexit significances in any new film with a British slant and that does seem applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and spluttered back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obviously rubbish we are be the nation's new export opportunity?
At any rate, the pop-eyed, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has had his licence to cock things up renewed for the second time - that name of his signalling more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemagoing territories.
He is of course the daft secret agent who despite his bizarre pretensions to smoothie glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a dollop of that chap contributing a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
He's also originally based on the traveller and international man of mystery Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos in his wake.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest JE outing.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in a medieval suit of armour and the rotor blades briefly clanging against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humour feels pretty underpowered and weirdly superfluous, especially as the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humour feels as if it is pitched at kids rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's wacky misadventures aren't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in the persona of Bean.
The perennially topical premise now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and embattled figure, already suffering a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but there's nothing much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that as every single active spy has been compromised, she will have to bring someone out of retirement.
And that means bumbling Johnny English himself, now employed as a schoolmaster in some posh establishment, but giving off-the-record lessons in how to be an undercover operative: some nice gags here, as English offers a School of Rock-type academy of spying.
English is whisked back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-suffering sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, hitched to a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of getting things terribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer woes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farcical high-jinks: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flash French restaurant; they create mayhem smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as he attempts to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are certainly pulled out for that last sequence, but as amiable and boisterous as it is, there's quite a bit of kids' TV about the whole thing.
Pretty moderate stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films I couldn't help thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies it is devising a plan for Britons to work a four day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan which will see Britons working a four day week - but getting paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same pay.
Sources said the idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
Shifting to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party pledging a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
The aspiration is currently not being endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole, however.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day working week is not party policy and it is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to claw back power from 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' at utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean current shareholders in water companies may not get back their entire stake as a Labour government could make 'deductions' on the grounds of perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand 10 per cent of private-sector firms' equity to employees, who stand to pocket annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could sway any Republican senators into pulling their support.
In an interview airing Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republicans Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could unearth anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said going into the hearing, I said, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that allegation came out, said, 'Did you do it?'
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, appears set in stone.
"My mind's made up about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everybody she names couldn't verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has it Done Anything to Decrease Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event which has a hugely impressive line-up of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which stated in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feeling like they are making a true difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing for a host of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equating to more than $37 billion that is set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or fundraised.
The group estimates the secured funds have so far made a direct impact on nearly 649 million people across the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the U.K. improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: "It'll be a long and hard path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the acts performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy for "blockade" to hamper Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy hitting the markets, including in the Middle East, US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as cited by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's engagement in Syria - notably, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is they want to broker energy just like they do in eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he has reportedly said.
And, according to to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to make sure the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to blockade, to make sure that their energy does not go to market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group which styles itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, leveraging and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
For that effect, the Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's "captive."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has drawn backlash from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Take "Hard Look" At Running For President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "hard look" at running for president following the midterm elections.
During a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she'd consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take a hard look at running for president."
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall, saying he was "taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I am worried down to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported such a run.
The poll showed more support for a run by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential run and 48 percent against it.
Other high profile Democratic names discussed in regard to a potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on Sept.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through coming back, I can relate to other families who feel ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a bit different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military, has given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence assault on a female, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum-seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions suit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang member sons," abused her but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The states' attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a bar violates that principle," the friend-of-the court brief said.
Attorneys further argued in the brief that the policy denying immigrants entry hurts the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby boy at an evacuation centre in the gutted city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking through waterlogged belongings, trying to salvage anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to continuing strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted feeling the violent earthquake shake the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's biggest selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them level rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In disseminating its propaganda, China's government is availing itself of America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's troubling economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Alienating Women Voters Ahead of Midterms With Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts Warn
As many top Republicans stand-by and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, analyst have warned they will see a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record already showing they wanted to go forward with a vote.
Those things can't be walked back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to placate angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the hallway of the Senate as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to be off the chart," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying it's already been high; that's true.
But it could be higher, particularly among swing women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who while they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.
"This has become a muddled mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's just not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be somewhat split over who to believe in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more siding with the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while just 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought forward by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they attended a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The Inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to Start a New Internet to Take on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds off of Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historical moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about the personal online data store is that it is completely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, process and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models are completely upended overnight.
"We are not asking their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross cleric celebrated
The only Church of England cleric to win a Victoria Cross during World War One as a combatant has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years on.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years on from his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the firing line and with the "greatest gallantry" led the line forward before rushing a field-gun single-handed and knocked out three of the detachment.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I know that I could never live up to but something which is humbling."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "feeling very honoured to play a part in the parade" and added "the valour of a genuine hero is being demonstrated by the support that is going to be given by a lot of people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this, you have stayed up all night to watch the a packed Bellator 206 only to be denied watching the main event.
The bill from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main card and was being shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as "some sort of sick joke."
"It's government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not suitable so they had to switch to children's programming, " said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said that they are going to work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about the replay, I think that we can probably work it out," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to work this out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when it switched over there were a lot of texts going back and forth and they all were not friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a governmental issue.
I can promise you the next time it's not going to happen.
We'll keep it down to five fights instead of six - like we normally do - and we tried to overdeliver for the fans and we just went over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he did not realise until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a number of months off because of illness.
Appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling different, have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to be able to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "caught me by surprise."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year but he said the age gap had never been an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics aged 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June, to a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his dad did not accept he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had their tickets yet for London 2012 - as he wanted to be on the front row.
"I couldn't say to him 'you're not going to be around to be on the front row dad'," he said.
"I was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he'd actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally acknowledged he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I had dreamt of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which had resonated with him in the build up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.

Out-of-form Mickelson benched on Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to turn his form around to avoid it being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he so often has been for the United States, the five-times major winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game on the range in the hope of rectifying what ails him.
Never the straightest of drivers even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal fit for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough routinely punishes errant shots.
And if the course on its own is not daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down starting the 12 singles matches, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role that he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's got a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't envision him playing two matches.
I envisioned more, but that's the way it worked out and that's the way we thought we had to go.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furyk said his presence brought some intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, likes to poke fun at people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun having a go at him, as well, this week, which was fun to see.
He provides a lot more than just play."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizeable lead heading into the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans but only just got over the finishing line with their noses in front by the narrowest of margins, winning 14½-13½.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only just," said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everybody on that team that this is not over.
You go full bore tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over till you've got the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've said all along, I focus on the 12 players that are in our side, but we are so well aware of what's standing across on the other side - the greatest players in the world."
Delighted how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow's a different beast.
Tomorrow is the individual performances that come forward, and that is a different thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going good, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested to the full of your capacity as a golfer.
That's the message that you need to get across to players, is get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself, as well."
In contrast to Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both ends of those big last-day turnarounds, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up a loser as Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in reply to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had rallied his players heading into the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get off to that fast start like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.
When that momentum gets going one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches.
We set up our line-up accordingly and put the guys out in the fashion that we felt like, you know, we're trying to make some magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been handed the task of trying to lead the fightback and faces Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," said Bjorn of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship postponed yet again
German Navy's newest frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace ageing Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least the next year due to faulty systems and snowballing cost, local media reported.
Commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels the Navy ordered back in 2007 will come as replacement to the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood they will feature a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the cutting-edge warships - said to allow Germany to project power overseas - will already become outdated by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.
Also, it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Aside from faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also becoming an issue.
It is said to have reached staggering €3.1billion ($3.6bn) - up from initial €2.2 billion.
Problems gripping the newest frigates become especially of importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged the Navy is actually "running out of deployment-capable ships."
The official said the issue has snowballed over time, because old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of the of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
National Trust eavesdrops on secret life of bats
New research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from building and development work that affects roosts and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, roost inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We've got the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within properties as it is possible unwitting destruction of a single maternity roost could kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their roosts.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to pitch in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their populations are faring."
Ronaldo dismisses rape claims as lawyers set to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as "fake news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, named as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is alleged to have then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, slammed the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no , no.
What they said today, fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner says into the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it is part of the job.
I am a happy man and all good," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to papers filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy" let down by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the pair had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified of retaliation" and was worried about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to overturn the settlement as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing carmakers
The UK "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience once these jobs go they never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "pushed back another week" as the fight over supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby endanger Mueller's independence, has fuelled Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate judiciary committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for that hasn't been set, it could be this week, I could see that pushing back another week given all of the other things that are going on with the supreme court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some reporters would contest that assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of briefings was not due to a distaste for TV reporters "grandstanding," although she said: "I won't disagree with the fact that they grandstand."
She then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president does more Q&A sessions than any president has prior to him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."
Briefings will still happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks and that's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly takes questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week the president perhaps demonstrated why, making a freewheeling and at times bizarre appearance before gathered reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland over Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish for them to stay on post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal have continued, heading towards expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK Government has also been stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very unsettling time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Undergoes Emergency Surgery After Suffering Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just kind of collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "no details on type/extent of injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles Saturday before exiting the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK with the extra cash used to help the homeless under new Tory plans
The move will neutralise the success of Corbyn's drive to attract young voters
The stamp duty rise will be levied on those who are not paying tax in the UK
The Treasury expects it raise up to £120 million a year- to help the homeless
Foreign buyers are set to be charged a higher stamp duty rate when they buy property in the UK - with the extra cash used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract young voters with pledges to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp duty rise will be levied on individuals and firms not paying tax in the UK, with the extra money boosting the Government's drive to combat rough sleeping.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the present stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-lets - could be as much as three per cent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of new-build London properties are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder.
Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people own their first home.
He accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high by snapping up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing disgrace."
Mr Corbyn has announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy homes as hard-working British residents.
For too many people the dream of home ownership has become all too distant, and the indignity of rough sleeping remains all too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become the Scotland manager at some stage.
The Scot, 42, is relishing the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who currently sit third place in League One, three points off the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and it is always something that has drawn me back.
That opportunity would only come, though, if I am successful in club management."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no trepidation in following such established names at such a big club, having previously rejected overtures from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be gauged by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It is not an easy task to get it there, but I would probably only view myself as being successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his management career, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from the brink of relegation to Championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled, of taking charge of Alloa.
"I genuinely did believe management was the right fit for me, more so than playing.
It sounds bizarre because I did okay, made a reasonable living out of it, and enjoyed some reasonable highs.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I still go through that in terms of the stresses and pressure of the job but management just feels right.
I always wanted to manage and now I am doing it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my entire adult life."

Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday, survey finds
The summer heatwave has boosted takings for Britain's struggling pubs but heaped more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in July - but takings in restaurants were down 4.8 per cent, figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs were up 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in June just got worse in July.
Drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with like-for-likes up more than restaurants were down.
Food-led pubs also suffered in the sun, although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Across managed pubs and bars drink sales were up 6.6 per cent for the month, with food down three per cent."
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, albeit a sales drop of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we've experienced in August will provide some much-needed respite."
Total sales growth across pub and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow down in brand roll-outs.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, survey reveals
Survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed growth in "fake Insta" pages
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty per cent of pupils said they have a "main" account to show parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed a rapid growth in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty per cent of pupils said they operate a sanitised "main" account to show parents, while also having private ones.
One mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old's daughter's secret site found a teenager urging others to "rape me."
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half of those admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing so many teenagers are tempted into creating online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from her wide-ranging experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has massive respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland would benefit hugely by bringing her on to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am keen to act as a voice for athletes and I am hoping I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his total of four Olympic golds and is now a regular BBC pundit, was left unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I suffered a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover or to what degree.
Its been grueling work but made a full recovery, re-learned how to walk and today doing agility drills!

A breast pump company has divided opinion online with an advert that compares nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the "world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired advert to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to expressing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn of cows to a track that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see no tail" and "In case you hadn't noticed these are not udders, they're my boobs."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding them babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies."
However, the advert, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it makes light of the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision using cows to advertise this product.
Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except their babies are stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.

Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Such an out of touch advert."
Others defended the advert, with one woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious."
"I think this is a genus idea.
I would've had one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advert is a little mad but I took it for what it was.
This is a genius product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advert aimed at mums who pump (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advert praising or judging the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the group of women reveal they've all been dancing with the discreet pumps tucked in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breast-pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between expressing women and dairy cows we wanted to put breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in an entertaining and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
"Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens.
So we are continuing to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
Seeking to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported.
The longer that children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked, because of its size.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish 'occupying forces' to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" of both terror groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-wracked country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were fine for them to return, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to press ahead with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal averted a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem however stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee comprised of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections.
Moualem laid out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be restricted "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
By that logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are probably hoping, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
In what would no doubt be "The most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"
As of now, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a fire that people are being drawn to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, show runner of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would be voting for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh,"" Ms. Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story lines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Tuning out is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself on hour six of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-leather bomber jacket ("a garment thick with hubris," The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's lurid descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he is feeding you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump show's rotating cast and daily plot twists (picking a fight with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode or you're left behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't peel himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back in the day and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,"" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was sort of a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money floods into tightest midterm election House races
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of cash, thanks to a realignment of a congressional districts that landed two incumbents in a race for the same seat.
This recently redrawn suburban Pittsburg district pits Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in Republicans' favor.
The race in the new 17th has touched off a campaign finance slugfest between the major party finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow win in a widely watched in March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given Democrats a slight edge.
U.S. Weighed Penalizing El Salvador Over Support for China, Then Backed Off
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pushback from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to call back the American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement early this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for narcotics controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to go forward, effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now slated to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a signal of the import the administration places on the gathering, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next shoe to drop could be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there now is very substantial evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly also turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.
Should Congress change hands, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go again before the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
That is a lot of ifs, and I do not mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how prolonged the struggle may be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d"état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that ensued.
The course of history pivots around such inflection points, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or delayed.
Americans face several of these inflection points now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water ever since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his being unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times's account is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not full or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be in for a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me off to light Sabbath candles on that table bearing the swastika.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna clash
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to greater things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.
Maybe we could have nicked it in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better side.
Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points but that will be tough game because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push on and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself but there's a feelgood factor about the place now.
The squad's good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training's good.
Hopefully, we can push on now, put last season behind us and be successful."
Women are losing sleep over this retirement savings fear
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were speaking with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they spoke with their kids about it.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they aren't taking the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to begin.
Talk to your spouse and the kids: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't make your wishes known well ahead of time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insuring with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Hammer out your legal documents: Head off legal battles at the pass.
Get a health-care proxy in place so that you designate a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you're unable to communicate.
Also, consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You would select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure your bills get paid if you're incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions on medications and allergies?
Spell out those details in a written plan so that you're ready.
"It's not just the financials that are in play, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who will care for the dog?
Have that plan in place."
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot multiple times with an air rifle as he walked home from a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications knocked out, relief officials have not been able to get any information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The regency, an administrative region below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia sits on the seismically Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major quake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that smashed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake hit one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, triggering up tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A shallow quake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded by the devastation of the deadly 2004 quake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Major quakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance attempted to call police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone from her.
Palin is being remanded in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, reported KTUU.
He appeared in court Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, for sure" when asked his plea, reported the network.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanours, meaning he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanour, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the report of a domestic violence crime, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had alleged that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down with death tolls expected to rise in coming days.
The earthquake hit just off central Sulawesi which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami smashed on shore.
Federal prosecutors seeking rare death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclist in his path on Oct.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those counts carry a possibly death sentence, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury slapped Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight charges of murder in aid of racketeering, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried it out as "heinous, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the notice of intent states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were both put to death by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He stated to investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to 'mobilise the people's army' today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to 'feel the heat' from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK 'would have been out' by now if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The premier is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted she will push ahead with trying to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'chuck Chequers'.
He suggested Mr Farage should have been made a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand up for Brexit but we need to chuck Chequers.'
Setting out his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We didn't fight world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is completely untrue.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march, telling reporters: 'I am simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the Opposition's not going to vote for it, it's unpopular with our party and our activists who actually pound the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Please drop Chequers and start listening.'
In a pointed message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the rally politicians must be made to 'feel the heat' if they were about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'This is now about a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with doing that'.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: 'I want you to make our political class, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
'We are mobilising the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A smattering of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with a party app as the conference opened.
'These are the people who tell us they can have the IT systems in place and all of the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It is a complete farce.
There isn't such a thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to take a 'hard look' at running for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she'll take a "hard look at running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might take on Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the town hall format since Trump took office.
An attendee asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest made in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University's campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, per 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on scene, in possession of a weapon, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders hand him win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes" team orders would play a large part in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack, something which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a double-move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he held onto his tyres to target a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.
He eventually came into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman told let me by.
The team have done such an exceptional job to have a one two," said Hamilton.
That Was Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "mean and nasty and untruthful."
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is going on over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people that are angry and mean and nasty and untruthful," he said.
"When you look at releases and leaks and then they say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait one minute.
Did we leak...No, we didn't leak," he added, in an impression of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to hold it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But her denial did not appear to sit well with the president, who commented during the Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you what, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the nastiness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," Mediaite reported the president saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer hit two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars atoned for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead through strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home side level before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals secured their victory.
It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was a fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute on 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home side back into the game on 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became provider for Cownie's equaliser on 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took a lead into the first break when he hit his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard once again put them on level terms with a power play goal on 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second period and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, are at home to Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies To Ensure Hundreds On Plane Can Escape Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people made it safely off the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He stayed put to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in hospital.
Spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our heart breaks to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach the thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying that access to the the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The toll is believed to be still increasing since many bodies were still under the wreckage while many have not able to be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking all of you to work day and night to complete every tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing, after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a release that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unable to account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon short of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"That's an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and yelling, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on improving a wharf also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to shuttle people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst lays out timeline of night woman was burned alive
The prosecution rested its case Saturday in the retrial of a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined for the jury how he used cellphone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cellphones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the evening of her death, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported .
When data showed his cellphone was with Chambers' during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cellphone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim hip hop moved away from its origins of political messages and tackling social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY nanny sues couple over firing after "racist" text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a misdirected text from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny they are racist, likening the suit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when finding out that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black upon arriving for her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her gaffe, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day of work and then sent home for an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation over the firing, and is seeking compensation to the tune of $350 a day for the six-month, live-in gig she had initially been hired to do, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do stuff like that," she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have hit back at the claims that they are racist, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do, fearing they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife had sent her something that she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Likening the suit to "extortion," Plasco said his wife was just two months off having a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're going to go after someone like that?
That's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social media, slamming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn't relate to a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put oneself in the shoes of somebody reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's very amusing knowing now what we know about Paddington's huge success."
Saying her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book by a small toy bear, would have been sanguine about his work being rejected, she added the 60th anniversary of the books publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't a boastful person," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like if you have a child who achieves something: you're proud of them even though it's not your doing really.
I think he viewed Paddington's success sort of in that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
On landing her daughter had been rushed to Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad was calling regularly to say it was really bad, that she wasn't expected to make it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say she was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly petering out and leaving her system.
She had died some time before hand and this was it all shutting down.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing this was all unfolding.
I couldn't howl or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to really hold it together."
Eventually Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, by now grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside the other passengers - oblivious to the ordeal she was going through.
"No-one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and tears were falling the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering with depression and killed himself aged 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel everyday," she said.
Ms Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up any room."
However, he gave up work before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one to find his sibling after he had taken his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I continually worry that there's going to be a knock on effect."
Ms Davis created the cards, "to let people know there are people out there that you can go to and you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you need to talk."
Ms Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say that he was feeling down or depressed or anything," she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change in attitude.
He was at rock bottom on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents he didn't make eye contact with them or anything."
She said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to work through it: "It rips a hole through the family.
It tears us apart.
But we've all got to carry on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI begins investigation
"I thought, if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - an investigation limited in time, limited in scope - we could maybe bring a little unity," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid entrenched partisan gridlock.
Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is all due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, lobbying them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It's still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea defector numbers 'drop' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations.
This came after June's historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever performed that way, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times nearly shouting and choking up while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think that he disqualifies himself with those statements and the manner in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi demurred when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrats gain the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then he's not fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered to be a conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions on whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to the court and expect us to say, 'isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And Women Need to Wield It.
It is a righteous diatribe, months and years of fury spilling over, and she can't get it out without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's uncommon, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive someplace, who said she also cried when she got angry, but developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she'd say to the person she was talking to, "You may think I am sad because I am crying.
I am angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought that was brilliant."
Tears are permitted as an outlet for wrath in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories from an early job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself weeping with inexpressible rage, was my being grabbed by the scruff of my neck by an older woman - a chilly manager of whom I'd always been slightly terrified - who dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and will be pleased because they got to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential runs.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and bowed out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, figured there was no reason she shouldn't explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision," she said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Somebody called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind on fund-raising, and so she vowed that she wouldn't enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give her only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions - gratitude for the people who'd supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger at the sexism - that she got choked up.
"You would have thought I'd had a nervous breakdown," recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You'd have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She cried"?""
How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time in kind, most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards right, US trade war pressures could positively support China over the long term by lowering the inter-dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic tailspin in either country is actually a lot more dangerous than onlookers have acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it's ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by a more than seven-year long war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe clinches Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they required to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most of the tournament, plunked his tee-shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole, conceding his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all of his rounds, becoming 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format begun in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the tournaments all-time winningest European with 25.5 career point.
"I don't usually cry but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
So thankful for Thomas to pick me and believe in me.
I am so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team., and I'm happy I was able to help," said an emotional Garcia following the European victory.
He passes the torch to his fellow countryman John Ram who took down US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles play on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel, to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all-time, having won 14 major titles second to only Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairways with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the entire tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was time this morning when we put some heat on Europe.
We scrapped.
Hats off to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as captain.
You have to tip your cap.
We got outplayed."

The newest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in Red Tide concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, patchier bloom conditions are being reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - which suggests decreasing concentrations.
A bloom the Red Tide extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
Patches can be found about 10 miles offshore of Hillsborough County, but at fewer sites relative to last week.
Red Tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations in or offshore of Pinellas County have been reported in the past week, low to high concentrations offshore of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations in or offshore of Sarasota County, background to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in or offshore of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
Respiratory irritation was not reported in Northwest Florida over the past week.
The number of new Ukrainian recruits ready to go to Donbass has become public
Official representative of the peoples’ militia of the self-proclaimed Lugansk People’s Republic Andrey Marochko claimed that Ukrainian will send at least 3 thousand new recruits to Donbass in winter 2018-2019.
This is how Kyiv tries “at least somehow to staff the units,” he said.
“The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the Ukraine’s military forces, mass resignments lead to low understaffing,” said Marochko cited by RIA Novosti.
Also, he doesn’t exclude that the real numbers of conscripts in the Ukrainian army can be raised is necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kyiv started so-called antiterrorist operation, that ws later changed to the united forces operation.
This measure was supposed to strengthen the role of the Ukrainian military in settling the situation.
In the late August 2018, the situation in Donbass escalated as the DNR head Aleksandr Zakharchenko was killed.
The DNR authorities qualified it as a terrorist act.
The investigation detained several people related to the explosion.
According to the preliminary information, they confirmed that the action was organised by the Ukrainian special services.
US urged Elon Musk to resign from as a chairman of Tesla
American businessman Elon Musk will step down as a chairman of Tesla company that he founded, fulfilling the US authorities demand.
To settle the charges of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman will also pay $20 million.
According to the CNBC channel, the pre-court settlement with the authority lets Musk stay as the company’s chief executive.
He had to pay $20 million and resign as a chairman within 45 says from the settlement for a period of at east three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed instead.
The settlement still has to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it became public that the что U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk in deceiving the shareholders by claiming that he has enough money to buy all company shares. The commission applied to court.
In his Twitter, the businessman claimed that he’d like to buy all Tesla shares at $420 per piece, but he never did it.

The Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom Jeremy Hunt has compared the European Union with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of holding member countries of the community captive.
The diplomat claimed this at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham that opened on Sunday, September 30.
According to Daily Mail, Hunt’s comment concerned the difficulties in Brexit talks.
“What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream?
The European Union was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving.
The lesson from history is clear: if you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won't diminish, it will grow. We won’t be the only prisoner willing to escape the trap,” claimed the minister.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave EU just make the crisis more severe, notes Gazeta.Ru.
In the middle of September, the British prime minister Theresa May claimed that Brexit talks are stuck.’
This is how she commented on informal EU summit in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was taken in 2016 following the referendum.
The UK is expected to quit EU until April 2019, but the talks with Brussels on this issue faced a lot of difficult issues.
In particular, there’s still no agreement on how the parties are going to interact after London leaves the community.
Also, the question about the Irish border remains open.

The head of the Altai village council stopped his hunger strike in defense of the interests of residents
The deputy said on his Facebook page that he had stopped his fast for several reasons.
The head of the village council said that the situation was at a standstill, the district administration was not responding to his demands, and he needed to do his job.
In addition, the prosecutor's office began to inspect the situation, and the heat supply organization STPK promised to begin work on preparing the system for the winter heating period in the village of Sibirsky next week.
Also the residents of the village council drew up and brought a massive collective request to the governor of the Altai territory, "concerning the current catastrophic situation".
Boronin himself said that he was feeling fine, and that he performed his duties as a head during the hunger strike to the full degree.
As Boronin explained, the villages of Sibirsky and Rogulichny have centralized heat supply systems, which means that the authority for their preparation for winter must be exercised by the administration of the Pervomaisk district.
However, so far no one has begun this work.
The head of the village council also protested against the lack of proper control and support from the government of the Altai territory and against the financial policy of "Gazprom mezhregiongaz Novosibirsk".
In addition to the proper preparation of villages for the winter, Boronin demanded "to immediately organize on the territory of the municipality a full-fledged independent utility sector with the appropriate staff units".

"It was a very important victory for us.
After the match in St. Petersburg, we held a meeting and agreed that we should leave this game behind us and prepare for Minsk.
We knew that Dinamo had enjoyed a big victory before our game, so we prepared for it very seriously.
It was important to attack during the power play. I am happy for our players who took advantage of the power play.
Recently, we have played well during power plays, but have not been able to score.
And at last the red light behind the goal lit up.
We knew that Minsk would come out locked and loaded and ready to put their best face forward, and that’s how it turned out.
The part of the game with a power play was decisive; we scored the winning goal during a power play.
We had a good third period today, despite the fact that we let in an early goal in the period and it was clear that it would not be easy.
But we played very well in defense, restricted the opponent to few chances, did not allow them to catch us out during substitutions. Dinamo did not have any power plays, so the game ended well for us", said Hartley, as reported by the Omsk press office.

Elon Musk was forced to leave his post as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Tesla founder Elon Musk settled their dispute over a fraud case.
CNBC News reports on this.
The TV network reports that under the agreement reached, Musk must leave his post as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors.
The SEC allowed Musk to still retain his post as chief executive of Tesla.
The Tesla founder must also pay an administrative fine in the amount of $20 million.
The same amount will also be collected from Tesla.
The money will be distributed among investors who were harmed.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur on the list of the 50 wealthiest people on the planet according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the space company SpaceX, the neurotechnology company Neuralink, and creator of the electric-car company Tesla, as well as founder of Paypal.
The SEC previously brought a case against Tesla chief executive Elon Musk for his announcement posted on Twitter of a possible buyout of the company.
Last month Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and to buy out all its shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The $420 share price was supposedly set “due to the significance of this number in marijuana culture,” the Bloomberg news agency earlier reported with a quote by Steven Peikin, Co-Director of the SEC’s security department.
Elon Musk consequently dropped his plans to buy up the shares.
Commenting on the court case brought against him by the SEC, the businessman stated that he considers the allegations of fraud unfounded, and added that he is very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
“Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I didn’t violate it at all,” said the businessman in an interview with CNBC.
Meanwhile in August a group of Tesla shareholders brought a class-action lawsuit against Musk complaining of financial losses that they had incurred.
The plaintiffs asserted that Musk’s posts resulted in losses for them.
In particular, one of the shareholders stated that the tweets from Musk led to mistakes whereby sellers of Tesla shares were forced to purchase securities at artificially high prices in order to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also pointed out that careless statements by Elon Musk caused sharp fluctuations in the share price.
In September Musk was accused of market manipulation also by the head of Citron Research.
Meanwhile, if Musk hadn’t been able to settle his case with the SEC, he could have faced removal from the company’s management and even prison.
Former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt told CNBC about this.
Musk is “not a bad guy, but he’s not capable of managing a car company.”

On September 30, 1928, i.e., exactly 90 years ago, the British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming worldwide fame and made him the Nobel laureate.
By the way, the isolation of penicillin from mold fungi was not the first discovery of Fleming.
A few years earlier, when he had a cold, he placed mucus from his own nose on a Petri dish (this is a kind of a glass dish in which experiments are conducted with bacteria) and a few days later he discovered that the bacteria that was there had been destroyed.
Penicillin was also discovered by chance in almost the same way.
Fleming's name was added to the list of the 100 most prominent personalities in human history.
His discovery, according to many scholars, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to beat the most longstanding diseases previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, in 1945, Fleming arrived in the French capital, Paris newspapers wrote: “He did more than dozens of divisions to defeat fascism and liberate France".
According to experts, Fleming’s discovery of the world's first antibiotic has saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died in his home in London in 1955 from a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous London Cathedral of St. Paul.
Where, by the way, a talkative Russian-speaking guide drew the attention of me and my wife to it.
And a few years later, we had a chance to see Alexander Fleming's full size statue in the most unexpected place for this in the capital of Spain.
There, near the main bullfighting arena Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to a man, whose efforts, in their opinion, saved the lives of hundreds of eminent bullfighters.
By the way, I found this very interesting, in my opinion, porcelain work at the same place, in Madrid, but at another time and for a completely different reason.

Does aspirin stop strokes?
This is an information echo after the European Congress of Cardiology, - said the chief cardiologist of the CCH of the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation Nikita Lomakin.
There were reports that aspirin does not protect during primary prevention in people at low risk of heart and vascular disease.

In these cases, it remains remedy No. 1.
Trump spoke of “being in love” with Kim Jong-un
While earlier they had bullied each other, the leaders of the US and North Korea have practically fallen in love, joked Donald Trump.
US President Donald Trump reported a well-executed joke about their successes in resolving the North Korea crisis.
After starting with mutual threats of annihilation, now the leaders of the two countries have smoothed out their relations so well that they are virtually in love with each other, the American President remarked.
The man in the White House mentioned that he had taken on the North Korea problem from the previous administration as the most difficult problem in foreign policy.
Trump notes that Barack Obama’s team had so neglected relations with North Korea that it couldn’t even reach the country’s leadership by phone — the other side basically didn’t pick up the receiver.
Then the US and North Korea were on the verge of war, but today the North Korean leader is writing “beautiful letters” to the White House, said Trump.
Trump admitted that he had been “nasty” to Kim Jong-un, which, by the way, was mutual.
But now their relations have been smoothed out to the point that the leaders “have fallen in love with each other.”
Trump meanwhile asked people not to take his words literally and warned that American media will interpret his statements as incompetence.
Trump pointed out that recently Pyongyang had stopped its nuclear and missile tests, and is closing military bases.
The American president is sure that all of this is the achievement of his administration.
Last Tuesday Donald Trump spoke flatteringly of Kim Jong-un at a meeting of the UN’s General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his bravery and for the steps he has taken to de-escalate tensions.
Trump also noted that sanctions against North Korea are being kept in place until the moment of full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore
On the 12th of June in Singapore, the first negotiations in history took place between leaders of the US and North Korea.
After a significant worsening in relations and mutual threats to use nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a breakthrough in the protracted North-Korean/American crisis.
At the end of the negotiations, the two sides expressed the intention to move in the direction of a peaceful resolution of the conflict, while not taking on any legal obligations.
Positive results from the meeting were the suspension of nuclear and missile tests by North Korea, as well as the return to the US of the remains of American soldiers from that country.
At the same time, no other practical steps toward the denuclearization of North Korea are being taken.
News media have reported that after the Singapore summit, the US sent several scenarios for disarmament to North Korea, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them “gangster-like.”
Volgograd residents squeeze mustard oil with their own hands
A mustard festival was held today, September 29, at one of the museums in southern Volgograd. Attendees learned about how mustard oil is made using old techniques.

Nitsoi called for replacing "Moscow language with a Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's author and advocate for the purity of her native language, Larisa Nitsoi called for relieving Ukraine from the "Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow language."
To do this, she proposes as the Ukrainian product - "a cultural wave, a cultural onslaught."
Nitsoi shared her thoughts on "the feasibility of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian publication "Observer".
In her words, the right Ukrainian product is ready now - it already exists and will continue to be developed.
With time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language", she asserted.
For example, in neighboring Poland, in her words, Russian speech was widespread on television and radio, but it was practically absent in the public arena.
In this regard, in Nitsoi's opinion, Ukrainians are not using aggressive methods in this process: actions by authorities to prohibit the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, merely "expand the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at a legal level."
Previously, Nitsoi shared her experience supporting a "Ukrainian language regime" at a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016 she threatened to sue the Watsons bookstore chain, one of whose cashiers spoke to her in Russian.
Nitsoi lost her temper and threw her change at the young woman.
She called Ukrainians' use of Russian words "linguistic schizophrenia", calling on Ukrainians to refrain from using Russian letters even when writing last names.
Recently Nitsoi announced that the name "Rus" was stolen from Ukrainians, and thus Russia should be referred to as Muscovy.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service could not evade the writer's wrath: having visited there and overheard conversations among coworkers in Russian, she started a scandal and absconded, slamming the door.
During the break we had a man-to-man talk, and it bore fruit

“I believe that we wanted to win more than they did”, “Ural” official website quotes Kulakov.
“It turned out to be a really tough game, we had a serious man-to-man talk during the break, and it bore fruit: we scored two goals and kept the opponent at bay.
“You missed a few matches due to your injury at the beginning of the month.
How do you feel today?”
“I played the entire 90 minutes, so all is well!
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe at the end I slowed up a little to keep things safe.
Otherwise, the medics and physiotherapist Vladimir Gashnev led me to this game, and I am so thankful to them!
“What can you say about the atmosphere in the team?”
“It is no great secret that after victories it is easier to recover and the mood in the team is positive.
Now we are on a good run, although at first we had some bad luck.
We need to continue in the same spirit and make our fans happy”.
“Did you miss the game during your time away from the rink?"
“I did indeed miss it a little, because I really was in an unpleasant situation.
But I would like to reiterate my thanks to the physiotherapist and medics for putting me on my feet.
The most important thing is that we won and made our fans happy.
Everything else is of minor importance".

This was reported on Sunday by press secretary of the Interior Ministry Toni Angelovski.

"The ministry will act in accordance with the law, so that citizens can peacefully use their constitutional right to freely express their will.
We call on citizens to observe laws and refrain from any violations of public order and peace and any violations of electoral secrecy," said the Interior Ministry representative.
In the referendum on Sunday citizens were invited to answer one question: "Do you support membership of the EU and NATO by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
The referendum is aimed at settling a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece about the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of a northern Greek region.
At an official ceremony on 17 June on the bank of Lake Prespa, through which the border between the two countries passes, the foreign ministers of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the official name of the former Yugoslav republic.
It envisages the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".
This agreement should solve not only the many-year dispute about the name of the country, but also open a path into NATO and the EU for Skopje.

That opinion was expressed by the head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Walid Muallem in an interview with the television channel RT, which was broadcast on Sunday.

I want to say that this is a very timely step, and we are very thankful to Russia for its efforts in this regard," the minister noted.
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that S-300 is a defensive and not offensive system, and it is intended for protecting the Syrian sky.
Pashinyan hopes to conduct early elections to the parliament of Armenia in 2018
Elections to the parliament of Armenia may take place as soon as in 2018, announced the prime minister of the country Nikol Pashinyan.
"Possibly, by the end of the year," replied the head of the government to journalists' question about the timeframe for them to take place (quote from Interfax).
Mr. Pashinyan also did not exclude that "again people will take to the streets" for conducting early elections, if the discussion of this issue with parliamentary forces is not crowned with success.
But I am inclined to conduct negotiations with parliamentary forces.
I hope that they are also ready for a constructive dialog", the premier was quoted as saying by Novosti-Armenia.
Nikol Pashinyan added that early elections are a demand of the people, and also a part of the government's program, for which the parliament voted.
"The long-term vision of the government," in his words, is also necessary for attracting investment and the development of the economy.
At the General Assembly of the UN in New York, Mr. Pashinyan promised after his return to Yerevan to start "negotiations with representatives of all parliamentary, and also non-parliamentary forces, in order to discuss the timing and conditions of early elections".
In the current parliament about half of the deputies represent the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA) which is in opposition to Mr Pashinyan.

Accusations were news for Dagestani deputy
The Sovetsky regional court of Makhachkala remanded in custody for two months the deputy of the People's Assembly Radzhab Abdulatipov, suspected of participating in a criminal organisation that documented disability status for bribes.
Kommersant learned the details of materials of the investigation, shedding light on how, exactly, according to the Investigative Committee of Russia, the younger brother of the former head of the republic Ramzan Abdulatipov, Radzhab Abdulatipov aided the criminal activity of the now former head of the Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices.
Among other things, in the course of the criminal intelligence and surveillance operations conducted by employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was established that Radzhab Abdulatipov had lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev to the position of head of the bureau, allegedly having received for this 70 mln rub.
Recall that earlier, in relation to Magomed Makhachev, other managers and employees of territorial bureaus of medical and social expertise subordinate to him, the investigation opened a criminal case under art. 210 (creation of a criminal organization with the use of professional position and participation in it), art. 290 (receipt of a bribe by an organized group), art. 292 (forgery by an official) and art. 159 (large scale fraud) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
As follows from the case materials, at the end of 2013 Radzhab Abdulatipov, knowing about the illegal activities of Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices, who were engaged in the theft of funds from the Pension Fund, joined their activities, having entered the criminal organization.
Holding the post of head of the directorate of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Dagestan and having connections with governmental authorities and law enforcement structures, and also using his familial relationship with the leader of Dagestan, Radzhab Adulatipov, investigators believe, "ensured the activity of other participants of the criminal organization, established contacts with officials of governmental bodies for the support of the illegal activity of Magomed Makhachev and his holding of the position of head of the federal state-funded institution 'Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise of the Republic of Dagestan', organized the illegal confirmation of disability status of citizens".
After disclosure of this information at the meeting of the Sovetsky regional court on Friday Radzhab Abdulatipov denied the accusations against him.
"Of course, all, that today is brought on me in the form of an accusation, to me it is all new, I am completely unaware of it," he said.
The court arrested the deputy from United Russia not for 10 days before bringing charges, as was with previous high-ranking Dagestani bureaucrats, but immediately for two months, since the case includes art. 210 of the Russian Criminal Code.
According to the Criminal Procedure Code, for bringing charges the investigation has much more time – up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

The Serbian leader made this statement during a press conference, as reported by the local newspaper Vechernye Novosti.
According to the source, the head of Serbia clarified that when speaking of the need for Russian support, he does not mean military support as in Syria.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly the subject of Russia in a negative light was practically absent
The head of the Federation Council committee on foreign affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers that the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly was successful for Russia and does not exclude that it could become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in the solution of global world problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is in that the rhetoric, to which we had already almost become accustomed in recent years in relation to Russia, was now much more subdued," said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by Rossiiskaya Gazeta.
He explained that in previous years the Russian Federation was sometimes "referred to as one of the three main threats to humanity, on par with Ebola fever or climate change or terrorism, Russia was among these, in any case, in the narrative of a group of western countries, which on this account spoke out quite unanimously".
At the 73rd session, emphasised Kosachev, "the subject of Russia in a negative light was practically absent".
"If one carefully analyses the speech of the president of USA, the president of France, the speech of the foreign minister of Germany, I'm not now taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, there was certainly no choir," the politician pointed out, noting that Russia "is no longer a kind of wall on which to practise hitting a tennis ball".
The head of the Federation Council committee does not exclude that this indicates a kind of tendency which, in his opinion, "will distinguish the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this tendency may only fully manifest itself in a year, in two, three".
"I do not exclude that the current session in some sense may be pivotal," allowed Kosachev, explaining that "there are too many examples of how with the inclusion of Russia it is possible to move forward in international affairs".
As an example he gave the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"At the moment, unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I do not doubt that in time the Russian view on the Ukrainian crisis will also be sought," the parliamentarian added.
He supposes that this is connected with the appearance of a "sensible, reasonable perception of Russia as not just a possible but integral participant in the solution of global problems of our time."
"I hope I am not mistaken, but I have a feeling that we will pass the point somewhere beyond which movement will not be backwards, it will be movement forwards," he added.
One other "interesting and important feeling" in this context Kosachev said was the "demand for the Russian view of how the modern world should develop".
"I was present at a great many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly session] foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and with great pleasure I saw that while one-two years or five years ago on the whole nobody was interested in the Russian opinion, the Russian view of what is happening in the world, now the situation is different," said the chair of the Federation Council committee.
In his opinion, this is due to how "the so-called new liberal order, represented by the West, does not have answers to the questions of how to solve international problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, problems of terrorism, problems of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, problems of migration".
"And now the demand for the Russian view is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev said with certainty, stressing that in this sense he considers "the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia".
Sirotkin finished last in the Russian Grand Prix
For Max this was an excellent result.
That’s considering that he started out in the 19th position!
How’s that for a birthday?
But the Dutchman is upset.
And we give our congratulations to Hamilton.
His lead over Vettel increased to 50 points.
Bottas is looking aside out of resentment, most likely.
Damask claimed its right to apply military force in Idlib
Damask hopes that there will be no need to apply military force in the Syrian Odlib province, claimed the Syrian minister of foreign affairs Valid Muallem.
However, he said, Syria has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey can quickly get the militants of Jabhat al-Nusra, which is forbidden in Russia, out of the demilitarised zone in Idlib, RIA Novosti reports.
The minister of foreign affairs also stressed that Damask will have to use military force to solve the problem to the East of Euphrates if curds express separatist intentions.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the talks with currish SDF forces went well until they were suspended because of the USA.
On September 17, Putin and the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan agreed to create a demilitarised zone along the line between the military opposition and government forces in the Syrian Idlib province by October 15.
Terry takes up the role of head of the Chelsea youth team
Earlier it was reported that the 37-year-old defender was in negotiations to move to Spartak Moscow.
RT reports, with reference to the Mirror, that the former England captain John Terry is now heading the Chelsea youth team.
According to the source, the well-known player, who has been part of the London club for a long time, will lead the team of under-23 players.

The first vice-speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, Irina Gerashchenko, apologized to the Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko, who was convicted in the Russian Federation for "espionage", for not being able to release him from the dungeons.
She said this in a video message to the political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko by the FSB.
According to her, during these days a protest is being held at the walls of the Russian embassy in Paris, whose participants have declared a hunger strike, while demanding the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, including people who know you well, are fasting in support of Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course, you.
There is not a single international meeting, not a single negotiation, not a single interview, in which the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government, we all, have not demanded that pressure is put on the Kremlin, that pressure is put on Putin, with one demand - Oleg’s release, Roman’s release, the release of the political prisoners of the Kremlin and the people who are being illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea", - said Gerashchenko.
She also expressed confidence that these hardships will toughen up every Ukrainian, making us "angrier, tougher in protecting the national interests of Ukraine, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil".
We remind you that the correspondent of Ukrinform in France, Roman Sushchenko, was detained by the Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 at a Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with spying for the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow city court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a penal colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia declared this verdict lawful.
Russian jailers granted a last request to the Ukrainian before his transfer to the colony.

"I could not even hold a spoon"
Vakhtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists are talking about how they managed to beat cancer.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, and popular people’s stories about their victories over cancer give hope to many sufferers.
The famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he was alive only thanks to his wife.
Many years ago he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
"It felt like a hammer had hit the bottom of my skull.
I fell over.
I became disorientated.
I was admitted to the hospital.
There I could not hold a spoon, could not stand, and fell over all the time.
They began to do tests, and the resuls turned out to be bad, the artery was not allowing the flow of blood.
They took me to Moscow, and there they said that there was a large purulent cyst in my head, and they did an urgent operation.
And during the operation, the doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst", - said Kikabidze in the program "Once Upon a Time".
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the residents of Tbilisi even came to his doorstep to say goodbye to their idol.
But the actor's wife did not allow the living actor to be written off, she firmly believed that he could beat the disease and for over a year did not leave her beloved husband's bedside.
If it were not for Irina, I would not be alive now.
When I have faced emergency situations, she has always been there, like a rock", - the actor admitted.
The actor managed to beat the disease, and now he happily lives in his house in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time he denies rumors about his illness, about his untimely death, which continually appear online.
The creators of the website "Peacekeeper" added the Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó to the "Purgatory" section.
The reason was "an encroachment on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine".
In addition, the head of the MFA of the neighboring country was accused of "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine", as well as participation "in organizing a provocation aimed at the massive violation of Ukrainian legislation by Ukrainian citizens".
Note that ahead of Szijjártó the governor of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Pavel and Onufriy, the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) were put in the "Purgatory" section.
The reason was their opposition to receiving the Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpattia, the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
Authorities named the price of the “golden parachute” for the deputy governor of Voronezh.
The deputy governor of the Voronezh region Yury Agibalov was paid 23 monthly salaries based on the regional law “On state positions”.
However, the actual size of the “golden parachute” for the official who was released from the post that he was temporarily occupying was in fact several times smaller than the sum mentioned in the media”
These clarifications were provided to the press service of the regional government.
According to the law, the monthly salary on Agibaev’s position is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, the one-off payment was 223,892 without the income tax, the press service stated, not one million, as the media reported.
The official was receiving pension starting from July 2018.
He was at the state service for more than nine years.
The payment and pension were accrued to him after he resigned, explained the regional government representative to RIA Novosti.
The addition to the pension wasn’t payed when he was at the state position, and his salary didn’t change compared to the previous period.
Aleksandr Gusev, temporarily acting as a governor won the governor elections and entered the post on September 15.
Agibalov was freed from his job in the end of his governor term.
Other officials at this position before resigned in the same way.
On September 29, the Nezygar Telegram channel published documents showing that Agibalov was payed 23 monthly salaries as he left the vice governor position, and two days later he received the same position without the “acting as” prefix.
State Duma deputy urged to talk to school children about the dangers of masturbation
Onishchenko holds the post of first deputy chairman of the committee for education and science.
Based on the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that teenagers are provoked to masturbate by harmful information they find on the internet.
It’s worth fighting against this at the level of educational institutions and families, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Moscow Speaks":
As part of the general sexual education of children, this must be done, explaining the harm, because here there is a risk specific to the sexual health of the child, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it lies in the fact that children reach puberty quite early, and then a large discrepancy appears between their puberty and ability to officially enter into intersexual contact.
According to Onishchenko, "prudishness", the hushing up of "problems of a sexual age" and the lack of a culture of adequate parenting are preventing a solution to the problem.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers encounter masturbation.
The deputy believes that the provision of lessons about the dangers of masturbation is most of all worth it in the schools of "hyper-urbanized" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, they will simply not understand us, to put it mildly", - said the professor.
Gennady Onishchenko is an acting academician of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, member of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, doctor of medical sciences, professor.
Honored doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the presidium of the All-Russian public organization "League of Nation's Health".

AfD is now second by popularity in Germany
The anti-immigrant “Alternative for Germany” party set a new record for popularity, while Angela Merkel’s ratings are falling.
By all accounts, Germany’s residents have started to seriously tire of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, which has made the country a desired destination for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Clearest of all on this matter are the latest opinion polls: Alternative for Germany keeps getting more popular, while the positions of Merkel and Seehofer, who head the two allied governing parties, are weakening.
This week the AfD set its latest record, rising to second place in popular preferences.
At 17%, the conservatives have managed to stay ahead of the social democrats, who have about 16%.
A gap of one percentage point could be attributed to statistical error, but the fact still must be noted that the AfD, which was established in 2013 out of a small group of economists and eurosceptics, was able to turn into a serious political force.
Leading in overall standing is still the CDU/CSU union of parties, which has about 30%.
But a falling trend is still observed: In April, support for Angela Merkel’s union of parties was still four percentage points higher.
The German chancellor’s personal rating is falling, while she is leading the government for a fourth term in a row.
Support now for Angela Merkel stands at 48%, which is 7% lower than last year.
We should add that after the Social Democrats are the Greens (15%), the Left (11%), and the Free Democrats (10%).
The Evolution of the “Alternative”
The Alternative for Germany party was founded in September 2012 out of the “Electoral Alternative 2013” group, which had taken in former members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially arose in opposition to government policy, but early on it handled only economic issues, including problems with the euro and interactions within the EU.
The group spoke out against Germany “subsidizing” weak EU economies, and didn’t exclude the possibility of reimbursing Germany and of a full exit from the European Union.
As the immigration crisis deepened, the AfD’s platform expanded.
In 2013 the group became a full-fledged political party, which occupied the Eurosceptic niche and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of its immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to enter the Bundestag for the first time, getting 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of Alternative for Germany received seats in the European Parliament.
A video was published with a journalist who called the citizens of Ukraine "a nation of blockheads"
The host of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV and author of two books Ostap Drozdov admitted live that he considers his compatriots to be a "nation of blockheads".
They believe the TV and read little.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"From childhood we were not taught a culture of reading and acceptance of texts", - the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State committee for television and radio-broadcasting of Nezalezhnaya began a campaign against literature, in which there are the slightest hints of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of whole 201 editions.

Canadians created a car to prepare for the apocalypse - Behind the Wheel magazine
Anyone who wishes can purchase this automobile.
The company Roshel Defence Solutions announced that it is already receiving orders for its armored car.
Roshel Senator APC, armored car for the apocalypse
The theme of the apocalypse is not just profitable for video game makers, film studios, and book publishers.
Now automobile companies are mastering this niche, which is new to them.
Thus, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions came out with its armored car for the apocalypse, the Senator APC.
In their time spent not pursuing dreams, the engineers of this company make armored cars for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are contained in a fully welded armored capsule that lacks special comforts, but is completely secure.
This bunker (it could not be called anything else, since its armor level satisfies the B7 standard) is installed on the chassis of the powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armored, can protect the capsule from grenade explosions and anti-personnel landmines.
Interior of the Roshel Senator APC, armored car for the apocalypse
In order that passengers not be harmed even by the blast wave of an explosive detonated near the automobile, the interior of the car is equipped with special shock-absorbing chairs.
Furthermore, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
For safe vision, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with an omnidirectional camera system, including nightvision, as well as an armored lookout tower on the roof.
The automobile does not have any weapons.
The front portion of the interior of the Roshel Senator APC, armored car for the apocalypse
In order that the weight of the armored car not reduce its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-horsepower durable turbo-diesel 6.7 liter motor, the entire power of which is transmitted to the four wheels of the armored car through a 6-speed automatic transmission.
The Roshel Senator APC simply has no chance of getting stuck
The Roshel Senator APC, armored car for the apocalypse, may be seen at a special exhibition in Washington in October.
Timeframe named for death of the Universe
The Universe will exist for approximately 140 billion more years, which is 10 times more than the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
Research of an international collective of scientists was published in a library of electronic preprints and sent for publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts arrived at similar conclusions by using the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope to observe about ten million galaxies.
Tracing the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy mass of the observed world, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Cold Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the Universe, which turned out to be a little slower than previously thought.
A press release from the Observatory Subaru notes that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the recording of data from the European space telescope Planck clarified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of ΛCDM.
In July scientists modeled the possible death of the Universe.
Three years earlier their colleagues presented new conclusions supporting the view that the observed world will end its existence in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Rip.
Another attempt fails to unite the initiators of the pension referendum
The opportunity to elicit the public's opinion about pension reform has been postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the nationwide initiative group for a referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
Representatives of 13 subgroups took part in the meeting, putting forward proposals for the wording of questions (in total, the CEC registered five questions).
They decided to apply to the Central Electoral Commission to register a single initiative group and ask the public the question: "Are you in favor of the pension age, as established by legislation as of July 1, 2018, at which Russian citizens gain the right to an old-age pension, not being increased?"
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and legally most succinct.
Most of the meeting participants were supporters of the Fair Russia member Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all the initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their agreement to take part.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (the wording of her question was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive an invitation and did not plan to take part: "It was not clear who our friend was and who our enemy".

Admiral created big problems for us
Zinetula Bilyaletdinov: Admiral created big problems for us
Ak Bars head coach Zinetula Bilyaletdinov summed up the KHL regular season championship match against Admiral (4:2).
"It was not an easy game. It was complicated.
Our rival fought with dignity, creating us big problems.
I am happy that in general we played well today.
I have said before that the goals will start coming as long as we work on it.
And the fact that we won is also very important".
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripov a breather in this game?"
"We have our own system he works by.
Therefore we took such a decision", said Bilyaletdinov, as reported by the club's press office.

In the match between Lokomotiv and Akhmat, Turbin's errors rained down fast and furious
Former all-union referee Vladimir Levitin commented on the performance of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship between Lokomotiv and Akhmat and assessed the controversial incidents of the game.
"How would you assess Evgeny Turbin's refereeing in the match between Lokomotiv and Akhmat?"
"I believe that the referee confirmed that he is not suitable for refereeing matches in the Russian Premier League.
It surprises me that with the mess in the fifth round game between Spartak and Dinamo, neither Turbin himself, nor the heads of Dinamo drew any serious conclusions about his lack of abilities.
The result had a quick impact on the ninth round: errors in his performance and missed calls on bad tackles rained down fast and furious.
For example, in the 50th minute, Locomotiv's Eder pushed over Akhmata defender Rodolfo in his own penalty area.
Just eight meters from the goal line, but Turbin did not call a penalty".
"How would you assess the incident with the participation of Idowu, who in the 82nd minute appeared to handle the ball?"
"I believe the defender deliberately handled the ball in his own penalty area.
Turbin was close to the incident, had a good view of it, and his assistant was to the right.
This incident should have been seen by the fourth official Sergey Karasev.
However, none of the three referees did not see it, and no penalty was awarded.
Therefore, the score was corrupted, and any sporting justice was ripped up.
It was a case in which refereeing by the rules was ousted and the sporting spirit of the game buried".
"In the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dare to send off defender Oleg Ivanov, who commited a foul in a duel with Krychowiak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card, he defiantly applauded him.
What do you think of this incident?
Was it necessary to brandish the second yellow card?"
"In this incident Turbin brandished the first yellow card in somewhat spurious circumstances.
A second would have been logic".
"Oleg Ivanov talked after the match about refereeing double standards in that some teams are awarded a penalty for such violations, as in the incident with Idowu, and others are not.
How would you assess the player's words?"
"It depends on how you interpret double standards.
It was a penalty.
But it wasn't given.
So the referee did not give a second penalty in the opposition goal.
That was the principle applied here.
And the second incident with double standards is that the referee looks at who is playing.
On Saturday Locomotiv and Akhmat played, and there have been serious complaints about Turbin's performance, because the team was put at a disadvantage".
Saturday Night Live started with Matt Damon playing Judge Kavanaugh, who has been accused of rape.
Matt Damon played US Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of NBC’s Saturday Night Live.
In a short skit, the actor played Kavanaugh at the Senate hearings where he is accused of rape.
Earlier, the Supreme Court appointee attracted attention with his emotional and detailed accounts during discussions with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
So, Kavanaugh repeatedly admitted to his love for beer, but stated that he had never drunk to the point of memory lapses.
In addition, in his attempt to vindicate himself from the rape accusation, Kavanaugh stated that in those years he had been a virgin.
Damon also played these details up.
“All I did was drink lots of beer, and I wasn’t thinking at all about sex.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin that anyone ever saw.
Everyone knows that,” said the judge as played by Matt Damon.
Earlier Kavanaugh was confirmed as a judge for the US Supreme Court.
Barbra Streisand discovered strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave completely differently from the original pet.
"They are not alike.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but cloning the soul is impossible," emphasized the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017 Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog of the Coton du Tulear breed named Samantha, which had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018 it was reported that a dog of the chihuahua breed named Miracle Milly, which was named the smallest dog in the world, had been cloned for the 49th time.
Specialists are engaged in cloning the six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so small.
The United States has contemplated a naval blockade of Russian deliveries of oil and gas
The United States could begin a naval blockade of Russia in order to obtain an advantage on the global energy market.
The US government is so eager to fight for success on the global hydrocarbon market that it is prepared to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world’s main suppliers of fuels.
US Department of the Interior head Ryan Zinke spoke yesterday of the possibility of a naval blockade.
Unlike other similarly named government agencies around the world, the department conducts not police functions, but civilian ones, and this includes carrying out policy in the area of natural resources.
For this reason, Zinke’s announcement falls entirely within his sphere of responsibility, though not without political overtones.
Appearing at an industrial event in Pittsburg, Zinke stated that with its naval forces the US controls shipping lanes in the Middle East and could block them if the need arose.
Zinke’s words could lead to the conclusion that the need may be tied to Washington’s desire to interfere with Russian deliveries on the global energy market.
Zinke mentioned that Russia still received the lion’s share of its income from world oil and gas deliveries.
He said he is sure that a desire to distribute energy shipments in the Middle East as well as Eastern Europe was the prime motive for Moscow’s expansion in this region.
The agency head made it clear that the US is still considering maintaining its leadership on the global energy market, now that it has become the largest supplier of oil and gas.
For this, Washington will have to put confine Russia and Iran, and Zinke considers a naval blockade of commercial routes to be an acceptable means to this end.
Kalmyk director receives acclaim at festival
Our fellow Russian and Gogol Center actor Yevgeny Sangadzhiev together with his film "Harmony" received a special mention from members of the jury of the Sixth Annual "Dvizhenie" Festival of Debut Films, which was held in Omsk.
The awarded festival certificate stated that "this is a signal that will earn an immediate response from large players in the film industry."
As many will know, the picture by the young Kalmyk director was presented as part of the "Movement. The Beginning" program of short films, in which eight films were entered.
The main prize in this competition program went to the picture “Yana, or Anya Written Backwards”, which was the directorial debut of actress Yana Gladkikh.
The "Dvizhenie" National Film Festival of Debut Films focuses on youth cinema. However, this is not to be understood as a reference to the age of the producers, but to their inner spiritual state and their desire and willingness to take risks.
As a graduate of the Elista Art School named after P. Chonkushov and the Russian Institute of Theatre Arts - GITIS, Yevgeny Sangadzhiev meets all these requirements.
He is young, talented, and creative, and in his work he strives to attain new non-standard forms of self-expression.

Russia will produce supersonic passenger planes
Production of supersonic passenger planes will start in Russia from 2030.
This was reported by Kirill Sypalo, the CEO of the Zhukovskiy Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute.
According to him, the academic centre is working on supersonic issues both as a part of international consortiums and as a partner of the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
“We estimate that we need 3 or 4 years, to build a working prototype of this technology, and 10 to 15 years, to get production line models that would allow us to transport passengers across huge spaces of our country", - added Sypalo.
He said that Russian researchers now face the task of making the technology economically feasible and safe at the same time.
In the beginning of September, the aviation engineering company Tupolev PJSC claimed that it completed the predevelopment analysis of passenger supersonic plain. They estimate that the plain will be able to develop speed up to 1900 km/h at the height of 11 km.
This was announced by the deputy CEO of the enterprise Valery Solozubov.

Who did this?
Putin.
In 2013, the European integration of Ukraine and EU membership was supported by 33% of Ukrainians.
Now this is 74%.
Who did this?
Putin", - Poroshenko said.
So thank you, Mr. Putin, for making my country much more European and much more willing to defend European and transatlantic values.
And we are very sure that we will not return to the Russian Empire", - stressed the president of Ukraine.

A club has appeared in Russia that I am interested in
Former captain of Chelsea and the English national team John Terry speaks about why he attended the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship between Spartak and Rostov (0:1).
"A club has appeared in Russia that I am interested in.
I have been following the team for just a short time, and it has been interesting to observe it from the outside.
I can’t say that I’m a fan because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I do like Spartak and want to apologize for my decision", said Terry, as reported by the Chelsea fans website.
With 18 points Rostov rose to third place in the standings, with Spartak in fifth place with 15 points.
In the next round, the red-and-whites will play Yenisey on October 7, and Valery Karpin’s team will host Orenburg a day earlier.
Expensive violin passed onto a pawnshop for pittance
When a man brought a violin to a LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop located in the city of Somerville, Massachusetts, the pawnshop worker offered only USD 50 for the old and flimsy-looking instrument.
But an experienced store manager, Dylan McDermmitt, suspected that it was in fact an old and expensive instrument, and he decided to consult with an expert for an appraisal.
It was then discovered that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin maker Ferdinando Gagliano and is estimated to be worth USD 250,000.
The bows alone for such violins are valued at USD 16,000–18,000.
An investigation revealed that the violin had recently been stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was then returned to its rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the person who sold the violin to the pawnshop obtained the instrument, but it is known that the seller had no criminal background.
The manager says that now everyone who brings a violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to them.
Exciting clash awaits fans in ninth round of Russian Premier League Spartak will take on Rostov at its stadium in Tushino under the leadership of Valery Karpin, a man who, as we know, is no stranger to the “people's team”.
The fact that the clubs currently have an equal number of points (15 each), occupy 3rd and 4th places in the standings, lagging behind Zenit (which has a distant lead) and only one point ahead of Dynamo, makes this match particularly significant.
The red-and-whites are going through a rough patch: the club is again plagued by idiotic scandals. Massimo Carrera's team also unexpectedly took a beating at the hands of SK Rapid Wien in the UEFA Europa League, and they recently lost to Akhmat Grozny at home.
After the match with CSKA Moscow, which ended in a fair draw, Spartak was able to beat Chornomorets Odesa with a minimum score and not without some difficulty in the championship. It is still too early to say whether the most popular club in Russia has managed its way out of its crisis.
For three games in a row Rostov has not been able to win, but it has gone undefeated now for five matches.
Let's see whether Karpin will be able to extend his team's winning streak by winning such a key match that they cannot afford to lose.
The previous meeting between Karpin's Rostov and Spartak ended in victory for the capital team.
The start of the match is set for 7:00 PM.
Aftershocks shake Indonesia after a powerful tsunami
Meteorologists have observed over 170 aftershocks in Indonesia, where an earthquake occurred several days ago, accompanied by a three-meter tsunami.
Measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale, the earthquake mainly affected the island of Sulawesi, according to the channel "Russia 24".
Over 420 people perished, and over 500 were injured.
Authorities had previously warned the population about the threat of a tsunami, but later rescinded the warning.
The fact is that sensors did not detect the approaching wave.
At this time, the fate of dozens of residents, who were preparing to celebrate a national holiday in the coastal city of Palu, the city most damaged by the elements, remains unknown.
London brought accusations against Moscow
Russia is attempting to reverse the results of the Cold War, announced the British Secretary of State for Defense Gavin Williamson.
Nevertheless, the UK will defend its values, he emphasized during speeches at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham.
Threats are mounting, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, enemies are working in grey areas using cyberattacks and fake news, added the Minister.
But the biggest of them is Russia, which is expanding its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Moscow immediately contested these allegations by western politicians, reports TASS.
Then the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt noted that Russia would pay a high price if it flouts international rules and uses chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the poisoning in the British city of Salsbury, in March of this year, of Sergey Skripal, the former Russian military intelligence officer convicted of spying for the UK, and his daughter Yulia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a referendum is being held on joining the EU and NATO, subject to changing the name of the country.
The referendum is intended to resolve the 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighboring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, an ardent supporter of renaming the republic Northern Macedonia.
The preparations for the referendum and today's voting are being monitored by international organizations.
The head of the observation mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers is organized:
Approximately 100 teams dispersed across the country today to observe the entire process, from the opening of polling stations to their closure, then the counting of votes and the drawing up of reports.
During the month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, and they oversaw the preparation for the voting, the work of the media, the observance of the law on campaign financing and the organization of the referendum.
Fei Dulgeri: "About 500 foreign observers are closely monitoring the voting process.
Groups of observers are recording the events in detail and communicating with members of election commissions, in order to subsequently put the information down in the final report".
An interpreter compared Russian and German mentality
Russians and Germans have different mentality but these differences don’t prevent them from understanding each other.
Berbel Sakse, a professional simultaneous interpreter, related this on the International Day of the Translator on September 30.
Berbel Saks is engaged more than 30 years in the translations from the Russian and English languages.
Germans like to plan quietly events, and Russians, as they say in a proverb, "long harness and quickly go".
But it seems to me, for mutual understanding between the people and for work of the translator it doesn't play a major role,” she said in the interview to RIA Novosti.
According to the interpreter, “it is enough to know history” to understand that the countries can’t do without each other
In the future, Sakse noted, there’s np sense for Germany to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there’s no sense in ignoring it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are a lot of things that define our common destiny,” she said.
A day before the German chancellor Angela Merkel claimed that the country tries to “start relationships” with Russia and sustain them.
Especially important, she said, it the Nord Stream - 2 project constructed from the Russian coast to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic sea.

Putin appointed a new head of the Presidential Foreign Policy Directorate
Vladimir Putin by decree relieved Alexander Manzhosin of duties as head of the Presidential Foreign Policy Directorate.
In his place, Ivor Neverov was appointed to this post.
Mr. Manzhosin had headed the Presidential Foreign Policy Directorate since 2004.
As one of the reasons for his departure a source close to the Kremlin named personal circumstances, noting that there were no substantial complaints about the quality of his work as head of the directorate.
Igor Neverov previously headed the Second European Department of the Foreign Ministry
In 2009-2014 he was the ambassador of Russia in Sweden.
Russians donated one ruble for a deputy with low pay
In Yekaterinburg the charitable fund Chelovechek opened a collection of funds for State Duma deputy Vera Ganza, who complained about low pay.
The progress of the campaign can be followed on the site of the organization.
"The Chelovechek charitable fund expresses hope that we as the whole world can save this public servant.
We ask all empathetic people to gift a chance at life and a happy future!
All collected funds will be given personally into the hands of the poor person.
God Save You!" says a message of the fund.
In total the benefactor wants to collect 380 thousand rubles for the deputy, which is the equivalent of a month's pay.
Accounts of help received are published on the fund's page in VKontakte, where the organization posts screenshots of money transfers.
The most frequent sums of donations are one ruble and 50 kopecks.
At the time of publication Russians had donated to Vera Ganza 1633 rubles.
The collection of funds started on 28 September after Ganza's complaints of a low level of income.
In her words, the average pay of a deputy is 380 thousand rubles, from which nothing is left over, so it is necessary to spend money with a credit card.
Ganza complained that parliamentarians are not compensated for expenses.
After this in the Duma it was announced that the possibility of reimbursing expenses would be considered.
The film "Between Two Waters" was awarded the "Golden Shell" at the festival in San Sebastian
The film "Between Two Waters" (Entre dos aguas) by the Spanish director Isaki Lacuesta was recognized as the best film of the 66th International Film Festival in San Sebastian.
The film won the main award of the festival - the "Golden Shell".
The Norwegian actress Pia Tjelta was awarded the "Silver Shell" for best actress in the film "Blind Spot" (Blind Spot).
The best actor was named the Argentine Dario Grandinetti for the film "Red" (Rojo).
The director of that film, Benjamin Naishtat, was awarded the title of best director.
The comedy Night School topped the American box office.
The comedy Night School, which debuted last Friday at American movie theaters, earned $28 million on its first weekend in distribution.
This success allowed the unimaginative flick starring Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to top the US box office for 28-30 September.
Released so far in only 20 countries, the film brought in $5.5 million, including $2 million from British viewers.
In its fight for first place, what’s remarkable is that this creation of Malcolm Lee pretty clearly got ahead of another newcomer in western distribution, the cartoon Smallfoot, a curious story of a charming yeti meeting a representative of humankind, whose existence the starring character had never believed in.
This project of directors Karey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig collected $23 million on its kickoff weekend, basically justifying the expectations of experts who had predicted $20-25 million for the weekend.
Regarding Smallfoot’s total box-office receipts, at the moment they amount to $38.6 million (while it has debuted already in 50 countries): Its most active market was Mexico, filling the coffers with $3.6 million.
The top three at the time was completed with the children’s tale “The House with a Clock in Its Walls,” from horror master Eli Roth. This proves conclusively that the director can produce quality movies for the 12+ audience too.
For its second week in distribution, the screen adaptation of John Bellairs’ book with the charming Jack Black and Cate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing total global receipts to $53.8 million.
In spite of its departure from the top 3, the thriller A Simple Favor, with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick, continues to be an incredible surprise: The movie was not realistically expected to perform well financially, but during 17 days in distribution in America this movie by Paul Feig collected $43 million (including $6.6 million for 28-30 October). And right now it actually has $62.9 million in total sales.
The last of the top five this week was the horror show The Nun, which raked in $5.4 million in the reporting period.
During 24 days in American (and of course other) theaters, the spin-off film The Conjuring has total earnings of $330 million and now proudly bears the title of most successful franchise movie. The franchise also includes the two parts of The Conjuring and the two films about the terrifying doll Annabelle.
The results of the past weekend show that right after this Corin Hardy horror movie comes one more from that genre, the newly-appeared Hell Fest, which is one of the major youth horrors of the year.
On its first weekend the movie earned $5.1 million in the US. It is the brainchild of the famous film editor and now director Gregory Plotkin, who has previously worked on a set of big horror projects including Happy Death Day, which Hell Fest in some parts strongly resembles.
The result is extremely positive when compared to the film’s modest budget.
The seventh was Crazy Rich Asians ($4.15 million), which seems unlikely to fall out of the American box office top 10. The romantic comedy has now been on screen for seven weeks, and for September it’s the sixth-highest-grossing film of the genre in history, with $165.7 million.
That’s exactly the amount the movie has earned so far on the domestic market; its total revenue is now $218.8 million.
The last three of the US top ten by revenue for 28-30 September were The Predator, White Boy Rick, and Peppermint — last weekend they earned $3.7 million, $2.38 million, and $1.1 million, respectively.
We’ll add that next weekend in the US, the long-awaited Venom with Tom Hardy will be in full swing. It will without a doubt take over the leading position in the American box office on the first weekends of October.
Of the other premieres of the coming week, the musical drama A Star Is Born deserves special mention. This movie by Bradley Cooper won at the Venice Film Festival. And also the crime drama The Hate U Give.
The head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs paid tribute to Nazi victims in Italy
In Marzabotto in the north of Italy a campaign was held in memory of the victims of the Nazi punitive operation, during which in September-October 1944 about 770 people were killed.
Most of them were women and children.
This year the ceremony was attended by the head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs Heiko Maas.
He said that "with deep sorrow and great shame" he bows down before the murder victims and their families.
Maas promised to challenge nationalism with the struggle for freedom, mutual respect and friendship between Italy and Germany.
Together with the German minister, his Italian colleague Enzo Moavero-Milanese arrived in Marzabotto.
The head of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasizes that the heads of the foreign affairs agencies are attending the ceremony together for the first time, and this symbolizes the desire of both countries to preserve the memory of past crimes.

Valery Belov: God helped Sibir today
The head coach of Vityaz Valery Belov speaks about the defeat at the hands of Sibir (3:4) in the KHL regular season championship match.
“A colleague spoke about the Sibir fans, and I want to draw attention to our fans”, said Belov, as reported by the Vityaz official website.
"I hope they will continue to support us in the same way, because now we have a full stadium and a great atmosphere in almost every game.
In the game, perhaps, God helped Sibir today, because they made bad mistakes, especially our leaders.
Actually our leaders lost the matchup 0:3, so it was difficult for us to get back into this match, although we had opportunities.
Nevertheless, I will take the blame.
Because apparently we missed something during our preparations
This was a different team to the one in the last match".
"This is ugly nepotism"
The audience is outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "Voice"
The viewers of the show "Voice 60+" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen sham".
When in blind auditions he recognized the voice of his father Nikolay Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But filial feelings took over, and he picked a relative for his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor bias at the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the star's father absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the viewers are not ready to forgive Agutin for such an injustice.
Yesterday we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by nepotism by the ugly and frank dragging our close relatives onto the final ladder.
I even doubted that Agutin had the stamina and sense of conscience to not drag his dad to the end all the way to first place", - discussed Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "Person from the TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "ejected" wonderful performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the viewers still want to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not at all the case; the viewers want an objective assessment and to see genuinely talented performers in the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants of "Voice" from the Agutin team - they were doomed".
"Last time, Agutin showed how he loves his dad, but today he had to prove himself as a professional".
"The competition has lost its meaning".
"Remove two talented people from the project and leave your father in the project who does not sing but whispers, how do you call a mentor after this?",
"You like how your dad sings, then organize a concert in the Kremlin with your money and see how many people come to this concert".
This is the show "Voice", and not the show "Big Shot Relatives".
"On the part of Agutin, this was unprofessional".
"Then you have to offer dad to perform on your own show, and not on a show that is made with the money of Channel 1".
"This was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don’t understand why the voiceless dad should evoke a greater appreciation than any other participant with real vocal skills.
Why was the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre ejected, and Agutin's father brought to the finals?
And then we all complain that for decades there are the same faces on the stage and on the screens!
Yes, because you cannot break through nepotism!"
"What did you expect?
This is Russia!
Cronyism and nepotism everywhere.
And the money in the family budget will come in handy!
The theater of the absurd continues!"
The users also recalled that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice", the son of Gradsky took part in blind auditions.
Then in no way did it occur to the mentor to take his son into his own team.
Moreover, he said: "Come on, get out of here, everything is clear".
Agutin could not act like a professional.
Canadian military servants are granted permission to wear beards for raising the spirit
Canadian defence ministry allowed military servants to wear beards.
According to the CBC channel, the bill contains instructions on how to take care about the beard.

Russia is starting to issue fines for violations in the field of shared construction
Starting tomorrow, Russia is starting to issue fines for violations in the field of shared construction, reports channel "Russia 24".
Companies and bureaucrats are threatened with the punishment if they do not timely submit data on a building under construction to the Uniform Housing Construction Information System.
This innovation will help those who decided to purchase an apartment in a new building, but are worried about the developer going bankrupt.
This was discussed at a conference in Saint Petersburg for representatives of the construction industry.
Due to amendments to the law on shared housing, developers must be fulled credited in a bank.
Many experts have already started talking about a potential sharp price increase for apartments.
However, as it turns out, not everyone agrees with this.
In the center of Kiev, a robber threatened a man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw money from an ATM.
The incident occurred on the evening of September 29 on the street Ivana Kudri, reported city law enforcement officers.

The head of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, associate member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrukovich talked to RIA Novosti about a possible research program for Russian cosmonauts to the Moon.
According to him, the scientific community is now developing directions for such activities.
"There is no consolidated opinion yet", - the scientist emphasized.
He noted that one of the options is to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the far side of the Moon, which would help to avoid interference that originates from the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to research cosmic sources of radio waves", - Petrukovich added.
He also believes that the Moon could be used for testing robotics, to use local resources for construction.
In addition, cosmonauts should be engaged in the search for primitive organic matter on the Earth’s satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help us work out how life comes into being on planets.
Earlier, the head of the "Roscosmos” corporation said that in an optimistic scenario the Russian Federation could carry out a manned mission to the Moon by 2030.
Offended customer dumps basket with feces at the 7-Eleven store
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, harbored a grudge against the manager of a 7-Eleven 24-hour convenience store: in May Simms was ejected from the store by the manager for inappropriate behavior.
So Simms decided to get back at his enemy in an original way.
At half past one in the morning, he entered the store and dumped the contents of the basket that he brought with him partly on the floor as well as partly on the products on the shelves.
The basket contained feces and urine, which Simms "borrowed" from a nearby porta toilet.
Police who arrived at the scene of the incident arrested the "avenger."
He was booked into jail and was released by posting bail of USD 300 pending trial.
He was charged with unlawful trespassing onto another person's property and a criminal offense, and he was also forbidden to enter the store again or to approach the manager.
Although Simms's crime seems more ridiculous than serious, his court sentence could be quite harsh, since he is a repeat offender: he has been charged with grand larceny, robbery, illegal possession of a weapon, drunk driving, and animal abuse.

We will face a severe enemy.
One brief look at “Severodvinsk” is enough, - admiral Dave Johnson says, cited by The National Interest.
The National Interest writes that the US is keeping its lead over Russia in this area.
Multipurpose nuclear submarines “Kazan”, “Novosibirsk”, “Krasnoyarsk” and “Arkhangelsk” are based on the improved project “Yasen-M" (885М).
Their displacement is 13,800 tons, the immersion depth is 520 m, the crew is 64 people and it can function autonomously for 100 days with an underwater speed of 31 knots.
The submarines are armed with mines, 533 mm tordepodoes and “Onyx” and “Caliber” cruise missiles.
In August, the press service of the US sixth fleet claimed that that American submarine fleet remains “the most powerful and threatening in the world”.
German politicians ignored the opening of a mosque because of Erdogan

They came out ready for the battle.
The special team played well, scoring two goals.
Clearly the players are experiencing great stress.
They are hurrying in attack and its not quite working out for them.
They just need to get through this and keep going forward.
"German Mikhailovich, how do you rate Yerofeyev's performance?"
"You know, I think he played great.
It was emotional, nothing over-the-top, just as we asked of him.
He attacked hard and created opportunities, such as the chance with Vitaly Kravtsov, when he failed to score with the net wide open.
For his first game it was an impressive performance.
I think that he will play in future games.

The SBU established the identity and detained the owner of a Peugeot-301, who yesterday was driving around the capital with the license plates of the so-called "DPR".
It turned out to be a former employee of the MFA of Ukraine, who currently works as an agent for one of the insurance companies in Ukraine.
According to the press center of the SBU, the detainee explained that the car had been wanted by Interpol since 2014, and was therefore detained in Russia and transferred to him as the representative of an insurance company.

The US can blockade Russia by sea if needed to prevent its energy supplies to the Middle Eastern countries.
So the US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke has claimed.
Speaking at the industry event in Pittsburgh, the head of the ministry said that energy selling is the only income source for the Russian economy, and that Moscow carries out active policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas there, as it does in Europe, writes Washington Examiner.
Zinke also noted that the situation with Iran is the same.
According to the secretary, it can e solved either economically or in a military way.
He would prefer to avoid the former, so he has to press Iran and push out Iran’s energy resurces.

There was nothing I could do and it was really difficult
Sergey Sirotkin: There was nothing I could do and it was really difficult
Williams driver Sergey Sirotkin from Russia commented on the result of the Grand Prix of Russia.
"To be honest, I don't really want to say what is on my mind.
I had a good start, but in the second turn I got caught between two cars which immediately sandwiched me.
I instantly lost all the gains that I had made at the start.
I ended up in a really bad position.
I was stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the others took a pit stop, there would be clean air and the pace would step back up, but the tires were worn out.
He also fought with his partner, with whom he also made contact.
As I understand, he made a few mistakes.
We ended up in such a situation on the track which is the hardest of all to overtake on, I could not do anything, and it was very difficult to be honest.
I do not want to talk about it anymore", said Sirotkin to RIA Novosti.
Sirotkin finished 18th in the Russian Grand Prix. The winner was the British Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev said the removal of Glushakov and Eshchenko from the starting lineup of Spartak was absurd
Russian Tennis Federation President Shamil Tarpishev commented on the removal of soccer players Denis Glushakov and Andrei Eshchenko on Moscow’s Spartak team from training with the starting lineup after a “like” on a criticism of the team’s head trainer Massimo Carrera, says Sport Weekend.
Carrera’s actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to things like that is utter stupidity.
I absolutely disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the discord on the team.
And first of all, it was just poems. You can interpret them any way you like.
If I were in Carrera’s place I wouldn’t have reacted at all.
After all, everyone has their own opinion.
And second, everybody wants to brag.
If Glushakov and Eshchenko post “likes,” that doesn’t mean they have something against the trainer.
I think that Italian isn’t flexible enough in his perception of the situation.
And that doesn’t help create a positive atmosphere on the team.
Spartak doesn’t have a game today, so there’s no reason to blow this whole thing out of proportion.
Maybe he should have just laughed with them about it.
There’s a lot about Spartak that isn’t right. They haven’t gotten their act together after the younger players came on the team.
“Judging from all of this,” Tarpishev is sure that “this isn’t boosting optimism before the game.”
The two teams will play on 30 September starting at 7:00pm Moscow time.
John Terry, fired earlier from Spartak, led the young Chelsea team.
The “Sirius” students discussed nature-like technologies with researchers
The students of the education centre “Sirius” in Sochi, participating in the School of agrobiology and plants genetics, visited a lecture of National research centre “Kurchatov institute”.
The lecture was a part of Global international forum of convergent and nature-like technologies organised inSochi at the instruction of the Russian president Vladimir Putin, says the education centre’s site on September 29.
The lecture was opened with a documentary “Kurchatov’s codes”, in which the institute’s president member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk told about global challenges that drive the development of civilisation.
The lecture was published on the “Sirius” site.
The school students learned that modern technologies need a lot of energy.
Alternative sources can’t produce this amount of energy yet.
Nature-like technologies that are being developed by the young scientists, will solve this problem, say the forum’s organisers.
Apart from this Kovalchuk talked about risks and responsibility when developing nature-like technologies.
“The advent of such technology is a unique phenomenon and a huge benefit.
They mean an explosion in medical technologies, improvement of the life quality and infrastructure.
But there is another side.
Development of nature-like technologies is in fact reproducing the live nature’s systems.
There is another side - it is an intended interference in the man’s life.
Risks are everywhere.
When a car appeared, people started dying under its wheels.
But we still use cars.
All technologies are double-sided.
When I am creating a medical technology, I may be at the same time creating a weapon of mass destruction, said the scientist cited by REN TV.
After the film screening and discussion about the recent scientific achievements, the students asked questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were the candidate of physics and mathematics, head of Kurchatov complex of nature-like technologies Yulia Dyakova and the head of Nano- Bio- Info- Cognitive and Social sciences and technologies (NBICS) complex of Kurchatov institute Vyacheslav Demin.
The education centre “Sirius” in Sochi was created by the education foundation “Talant and success” on the basis of the Olympics infrastructure at the instruction of president Vladimir Putin.
The centre is aimed at discovery, development and professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September it was reported that the winners of all-Russia online competition on information safety “Cyberchallenge” will be granted a chance to study in “Sirius”.
An air traffic controller saved a passenger plane during an earthquake in Indonesia at the cost of his own life
Indonesia bid farewell to air traffic controller Antonius Gunawan Agung, who saved hundreds of Batik Air passengers at the cost of his own life.
On September 28th he was working at the Palu's Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on the island of Sulawesi.
An airliner was preparing for takeoff at the moment the powerful earthquake struck.
Agung refused to abandon the air traffic control tower, and helped the airplane take off.
When the magnitude of the quake reached 7.4, the tower started to collapse.
The 21-year old air traffic controller was forced to jump from a height of four stories.
Upon landing he suffered serious trauma to his internal organs, and doctors were unable to save him.
Russian submarine Kazan frightened USA
The greatest danger for the fleet of the USA is posed by the Russian submarine Kazan.
So said American Rear Admiral Dave Johnson, Rosbalt reports citing The National Interest.
“We’ll be facing tough potential opponents.
One only has to look at the Severodvinsk," he said, pointing at a predecessor model of the Kazan.
In the opinion of the commander of US Naval Forces Europe James Foggo, Russia has concentrated its efforts on modernizing its submarine fleet.
Macedonia: the referendum failed due to the low turnout
The referendum was intended to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to "Northern Macedonia".
Greece objected to the use by the Macedonians of the name of its historical province.
The renaming offered prospects for the former Yugoslav Republic to open a way to NATO and later the EU.
But, as the EFE agency reports, the just 34% turnout at the Sunday plebiscite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only advisory in nature, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to reject the renaming.
Speaking soon after the closure of the polling stations, the prime minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, a supporter of changing the name of the republic, said that if among the votes cast there are more "yes" votes, then Macedonia will change its name, despite the quorum not reached.

Residents of Kemerovo outraged by flock of sheep in cemetery
On September 30, a message was posted on a frequented social network page devoted to Kemerovo by an eyewitness stating that livestock freely roam one of the local cemeteries.
A fairly large sized herd of animals has been browsing between the fences and are eating the grass.
Commentators expressed various opinions: some local residents noted that a few livestock in the small cemetery causes no harm to anyone, and their appetite could even help clear the area of weeds and mow the grass. Nevertheless, some residents of the city are not enamored of the animals.
One outraged resident of Kemerovo posted (style preserved): "This is a burial place, not a pasture.
Sheep have no business being there.
Of course, you can't say that the sheep are commiting an act of blasphemy, but that's not the point."
In any event, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem of the presence of the animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will be taken soon.
'Davlet’ (to exert pressure) or 'dovlet' (to loom over) - which is correct?
The word 'davlet' does not exist.
'Dovlet' is correct.
The word "davlet" with the meaning of "draw towards, exert influence, an impact" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "dovlet".
We use this word believing that it comes from the word for pressure ('davlenie').
But "pressure" and "loom over" are etymologically not only not close and are even in some sense opposed in meaning.
Have a think about that for yourself.
'Dovlet' (to loom over) (liturgical, literary, obsolete) means "quite, complete, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy".
It is related to the words 'dovolstvovatsya' (to be content) and 'udovolstvie' (pleasure).
Previously, it also had the meaning of "not to depend on anything, to be self-contained" - "to prevail over oneself".
The Old Slavonic "довьлѣти" ('dovleti') is akin to the words "command" and "will".
"Davit" (to crush), "podavlyat" (to suppress) are completely different.
These words have genuinely creepy "relatives": daos - "wolf" (crushing sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaidī - "to oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "davlenie" ("pressure") and "davlet" ("to loom over"), as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to contaminate one another.
So we had this very "d[a]vlet’", which is also used in writing with an "a", which, really, is incorrect and impossible from the point of view of the processes of the origin and development of these words.
So, it's correct to write "dovlet" ("to loom over").
But this word is obsolete and in its correct meaning it is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people exert a negative impact on you from above, use the word "davit" ("to oppress").
You can also use the construction "exert pressure", but remember that this sounds bureaucratic.
Russia was the leader in the EuroSkills championship in Budapest
The Russian national team was the leader in the EuroSkills European professional skills championship.
The event took place in Budapest, writes TASS.

Our car is noticeably slower than Mercedes
The Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen speaks about the Russian Grand Prix qualification round, in which he came fourth.
"Kimi, today did you have the chance to fight for the pole?
How did the car perform?
"It looks like Mercedes were much faster today", said Raikkonen, as reported by F1News.Ru.
But the performance of our car was the best since the beginning of the weekend".
"During qualifying you were no slower than Sebastian Vettel, but in the end the gap was still quite large.
What was the reason for that?"
"I wasn't doing badly, but then one of the Mercedes drivers got ahead.
He was preparing to overtake and manged to get round me, and this evidently lost me some time.
However, it is unlikely this greatly affect the result"
"It is very difficult to overtake in Sochi. Will the start of the race be the key moment?"
Basically you never know how things will turn out.
In any case it won't be easy, because our car is noticeably slower than Mercedes".

In Buryatia, two young men steal battery from car and electric cable from garage
Recently, the Ivolginsky District Police Dispatch Center received a report of theft by a 27-year-old resident of the Village of Khoytobeye.

She wrote on her page that her four-year old son parked his balance bike (children's bicycle without pedals) on the same lamppost all year.
One morning, a small sticker appeared on the lamppost with a photograph of the green bike and the inscription: "Only".
The delight of mother and child was boundless.
Christie thanked the anonymous benefactor and praised him for his interesting and fresh idea.
Her tweet quickly spread through social networks and made many people smile.
Comments to it were also remarkable:
"This is miraculous!"
"Thank you for beautiful communication in this world."
"I think there are few people in the world capable of such an act."
"Unfortunately, they do not draw the same attention as the mischief of scoundrels."
"This is the world that we need!"
Readers asked the journalist to tell them if she ever manages to find out who had the idea to put the sticker there.
Of course the culprit, by all appearances, must have been somewhere nearby: he saw the boy park his bicycle more than once before the idea occurred to him.

Russian bailiffs demanded a debt from a dead old woman
In Kurgan court enforcement officers demanded that a long-dead woman repay a state duty of 200 rubles.
Ural Meridian reported about this.
In mid-September relatives of the deceased Maria Mitrofanovna Slepneva received a letter from the Kurgan department of bailiffs, in which it was said that in relation to the 105-year-old woman enforcement proceedings had been initiated.
According to the court verdict the woman must pay 200 rubles to the local tax inspectorate.
After receiving the letter relatives of Slepneva contacted the department for explanations.
The department of bailiffs promised to sort out the situation.
Users of social networks, having found out about what happened, advised the relatives to submit counterclaims for nonpayment of the pension and social benefits to the old woman for the years "lived" after death.
In 2016 in Kemerovo a court recognized as alive a man who according to documents was considered dead.
The death notice was supposed to be assigned to his namesake, but by mistake the notice was done for the wrong person.

Vuchich implemented the highest level of battle readiness for the Serbian Army
Serbian President Alexander Vuchich ordered the implementation of the highest level of battle readiness, to which the country's Armed Forces were brought due to the situation in the north of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija.
"The President ordered the highest level of battle readiness to be maintained, and it will be cancelled by a separate order," Serbian Defense Minister Alexander Vulin announced on Sunday, whose words are cited by TASS.

Numerous immigrant communities and anti-racist organisations filed an open letter demanding the minister’s resignation.
Russia protected itself from terrorists with its operation in Syria
After three years of Russian military operations in Syria, approximately 100,000 terrorists have been killed, of which 85,000 were killed by the Russian Aerospace Forces.
This was discussed in connection with the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former commander in chief of the Aerospace Forces, the head of the Federation Council Committee on Defence and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of airborne weaponry: Aerospace Forces have precisely struck and continue to precisely strike all their terrorist targets.
In Bondarev's words, after three years in Syria tens of thousands of terrorist targets have been destroyed - including, for example, ammunition stockpiles, fortifications, and headquarters.
Russian airstrikes broke the jihadists' defences - this was a decisive investment in the advance of Syrian government forces, reports Interfax.
In this regard, in the words of Bondarev, the operation of our forces in Syria allowed the protection of Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the start of the operation in Syria over two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the "Islamic State" (IS, prohibited in Russia) and "Jabhat al-Nusra" (prohibited in Russia).
According to the data of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, four thousand IS fighters are Russian citizens and around five thousand are citizens of post-Soviet countries, reports TASS.
This figure refers only to those people who have been identified, and does not taken into account those who were not identified, Bondarev emphasized.
The majority of them were trained and prepared to take up arms at any moment, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, remarked Bondarev, in Syria Russia fights international terrorism abroad - otherwise this evil would "spill over onto us."
Phone numbers of Boris Johnson and a number of British ministers exposed
The personal details of a number of former and current UK government ministers became public due to a flaw in the work of the security system of an application created by the Conservative party, reports Sky News.
In particular, the mobile phone numbers of finance minister Philip Hammond and former head of the British foreign ministry Boris Johnson became accessible.
According to the television channel, several politicians had received "unpleasant calls".
The technical issue has been resolved and the app is now functioning securely.
We are investigating the issue further and apologise for any concern caused," announced the Conservative party.
During the glitch users could see not only confidential data, but also edit information in the profiles of politicians and journalists.
For example, in the profile of the minister for the environment, ecology and rural affairs Michael Gove his photograph was replaced with a photo of media magnate Rupert Murdoch.
Syria accused USA of supporting terrorism
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Walid Muallem accused the USA and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support of terrorism.
[The Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it destroyed the infrastructure and public services in areas against which its actions were aimed, it committed mass murder of the civilian population, including children and women.
These murders according to international law are war crimes," he said.
In Muallem's words, USA and their partners showed "direct support for terrorists", since the goals of fighters and the western coalition in Syria coincided and presupposed "sowing chaos, death and destruction along its path".
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also noted that the battle with terrorists in Syria was practically completed, and in the country it had become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus intends to also cleanse Syria of illegal foreign presence, and the priority in reconstruction the country will be given to Syrian partners.
In September the head of the Russian center for reconciliation of the warring parties in the republic lieutenant-general Vladimir Savchenko announced that two American F-15 planes had launched strikes on the Syrian province Deir ez-Zor with banned white phosphorus munitions.
USA denied all accusations.
The President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on the issuance by Hungary of their passports in Zakarpattia.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine", - said Poroshenko.
According to Poroshenko, he as president will protect Ukrainian citizens, no matter where they are - in the east or the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the MFA in the passport scandal with Hungary, which is the intention to expel the consul of this country from Berehove.
"I fully agree with every letter that was said by the MFA", - the President noted.
As reported by "FACTS", on September 19, a video appeared on the internet, which recorded the time of issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens at the Hungarian Consulate in Beregovo.
At the same time, they openly took the oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, noted that the consul of Hungary, who is featured on the video distributing Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself, or he will be expeled by Kiev.
It also became known that the prosecutor's office of the Zakarpattia region opened a criminal case on the issuance of Hungarian passports.
The incident comes under the "Treason" clause.
Putin secretly flew to Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the Council of CIS States, and also held a number of bilateral meetings with presidents of neighboring countries.
Data on the flights of the Russian "Board No. 1" on the Flightradar website indicate that at around 6 pm Tajik time on September 28, the Il-96-300 took off from Dushanbe airport and headed for the northeast.
In the area of Lake Balkhash, the aircraft's transponder was turned off.
The direction of its flight suggests that the liner could have flown to Khakassia.
According to information from the agency "Baikal24", the head of the region Victor Zimin personally met the president in Abakan on the night of September 29.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic to spend the weekend. However, site sources believe that the true reason is the "second round problem".
Next Sunday in Khakassia, the second round of the elections of the head of the region will take place.
Valentin Konovalov (CPRF) and the current head of the republic Viktor Zimin ("United Russia") entered it.
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
In the upcoming round, together with Konovalov, Andrey Filyagin ("A Just Russia") should take part.
The Khakassia media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and appoint a new acting head of the republic, and also take a decision on the fate of Zimin.
Putin already visited Khakassia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president’s favorite vacation spots.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the seven-year armed conflict in Syria.
About five million people fled to other countries, primarily to neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, the hostilities are nearing an end, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
This was announced by the foreign minister of Syria Walid al-Muallem, speaking at the UN: "At present, the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure thanks to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The government is continuing reconstruction work in areas destroyed by terrorists, returning them to normal life.
All the conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that made life difficult for people and deprived them of their livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities also urged the global community to facilitate the return of refugees and to allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the United States and the countries of the European Union refuse to provide assistance to Syria, stating that first a political solution to the conflict must be found.
"Volkswagen" admitted its guilt in full in "dieselgate" in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the American division of the company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The Group's losses are estimated to be at least 25 billion euros.
This figure includes not only fines and compensation.
By June next year, the automaker is obliged to buy or fix 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company management stated that the obligations had already been fulfilled in relation to 83% of cars, so the program would be completed ahead of schedule.
"Volkswagen" is trying hard to compensate for losses and regain customer confidence.
So, recently the management of the Group changed again, and large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes to the management system were announced.
Furthermore, "Volkswagen" promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesel engines on their streets: the authorities gained this right in February of this year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename the UOC with actions of fasists
The head of the synodial Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church Metropolitan Hilarion compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists in relation to Jews.
"It is the equivalent of how in fascist Germany they pinned a yellow star on Jews, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and precisely for that purpose this draft legislation was created," said the metropolitan in a broadcast of the television channel Rossiya-24 (quote from Interfax).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russo-Ukrainian conflict is at an acute stage.
Kiev in this way hopes to receive full control over the UOC and "outlaw it", considers the clergyman.
"It is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier it became known that deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on implementing draft bill No. 4128 (on changing the governance of religious organizations), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations,) and No. 5309 (on renaming religious organizations).
The latter proposes renaming the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Vicar of Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra calls for protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The Vicar of the Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra Metropolitan Vladimir called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian holy places.
The text of his appeal to followers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the monastery's website.
As the metropolitan noted, "Christians have been called upon to confess their faith and protect their shrines at different times in the history of our predecessors and spiritual brethren.
In light of the situation that has developed, and based on the information that we have obtained as well as the threats of reprisals that are spreading, it is clear that we are being called on to live through a period of adversity as well.”
He called for prayers and other forms of moral support.
In addition, the vicar of the Lavra emphasized that "your physical presence will also likely be required."
The priest added: "Lenin's spiritual grandchildren are threatening reprisals, and therefore we need to defend our shrines."
The message states: "As people who care about the fate of the Pochayiv Lavra, an Orthodox Ukrainian shrine and holy place of worldwide significance, we must be ready to defend it."
The Metropolitan urged his followers not to be taken in by those who mislead believers.
The vicar continued, "The UOC has canonical status, as was determined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990, that was issued by the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make us dependent on the newly styled Patriarch Bartholomew, who is a friend of the Roman Catholic pope.
This new style with the consequences that it entails is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
We are pleased with the status that our church already has."
He recalled that since October 1990, the UOC has been canonically independent as well as completely administratively independent:
"It is in no way administratively or financially accountable to the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, our church already has a tomos.
What further Tomos do we need?" The metropolitan of the Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra Vladimir urged believers and all citizens of the country to ask themselves: if other confessions have a Tomos, does that make them independent of the Vatican?
The priest emphasized, "Believers have already understood and decided which church they will attend.
However, someone wants to sow hostility and discord once again.
Some are stung with envy of the churches and their shining domes, and they want to destroy them."
The Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra is the largest church and monastery complex in western Ukraine.
The monastery sits atop the Pochayiv hill 70 km from Ternopil.
The first historical records of it date to the beginning of the 13th century.

I think that if we continue to play like that, the victories will come
Dynamo Moscow head coach Vladimir Vorobyev - about “Avtomobilist”'s defeat (0:1) in the KHL regular season championship match.
“It was a good game, an interesting one, though it only lasted until a goal", “Avtomobilist” official website quotes Vorobyev.
"We tried to play very simple.
Liked the first period very much.
Didn't take advantage of some good chances.
In the second period, our rival pressed hard, but we survived.
But the ejections “fed” us a bit.
The guys played really well, carried out the coach’s instructions.
I think that if we continue to play like that, the victories will come.
Did not score, and with no goals you cannot win a game, but the very content of the game was right.
Success will come if we continue to play in this direction".
“In your opinion, did “Avtomobilist” improve from the game in Nizhny Novgorod?"
“The foreign team did not play there.
During pre-season, the teams worked on other task, many young guys did play.
I think that was a completely different game, different hockey.
“Avtomobilist” is a good, top quality team.
Judging by the tournament table, the team is playing well.
Good hockey, a great atmosphere in the arena as well as in the city.
We can only wish them good luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
There’s many good players, and leaders.
A top quality defense and good goalkeeper.
It was difficult, we trained hard.
We knew that the team was unbeaten, we wanted to break their run, but it wasn't to be".
Every inhabitant of Kalmykia is in debt
Residents of the republic are increasingly visiting the official website of the Directorate of the Federal Marshals Service of Russia for the Republic of Kalmykia.
According to the specialists in the department for the organization and monitoring of the deployment of IT infrastructure and information security for the republic-level directorate, more than 140,000 visits to the site were recorded over the past eight months, of which 42,000 were recorded to the "Enforcement Proceedings Database" section, and 661 payment receipts for debt payments were downloaded.
According to Valery Bogdanov, chairman of the Public Council at the Directorate of the Federal Marshals Service of Russia for the Republic of Kalmykia, practically every citizen in the region owes back debt on utility bills, traffic police fines, bank loans, and other forms of credit, and no one is immune from unforeseen situations.
But debtors can expect to face negative consequences in the form of a ban on leaving the country, for example.
That is why the Directorate of the Federal Marshals Service of Russia for the Republic of Kalmykia recommends that everyone who has planned a trip abroad check with their local marshalls service or on the website www.r08fssprus.ru for information about any unpaid debts and pay them off before traveling.
The service has created a “Database of Enforcement Proceedings” for the convenience of its citizens.
This special electronic application not only can be accessed via the regional websites of the directorates of the Federal Marshals Service of Russia, but also on social networks and mobile devices, including iPads, iPhones, and other smartphones.
Delgir Bodgayeva, assistant to the chairman of the Directorate of the Federal Marshals Service of Russia for the Republic of Kalmykia, explains that the database contains information about enforcement proceedings initiated by Kalmyk police officers against all debtors.
"If there are debts, the system displays information about the number of them; the date of initiation of enforcement proceedings; the name of the agency that issued the enforcement order or other certificate; the certificate number, the amount and type of debt; the address of the marshalls service; the full name of the marshall/enforcement officer; and the contact phone number.
Information on the status of enforcement proceedings can also be obtained on the state services portal at: http://epgu.gosuslugi.ru"

In the pictures you can see how Zakharchenko’s car pulls up to the "Separatist" cafe.
First one of the guards enters the building.
Then the head of the republic enters it, along with the bodyguard, and after a few seconds an explosion is heard.
In the terrorist attack in Donetsk, Alexander Zakharchenko and his guard were killed, 11 people were injured.
According to investigators, the explosive device was hidden in one of the lamps and was activated by a phone call.
The authorities of the unrecognized republic qualified the incident as a terrorist attack and accused Kiev and Western intelligence agencies of involvement in the murder of Zakharchenko.
The main Macedonian opposition leader refused to vote on the referendum
On Sunday, September 30th, in Macedonia, a referendum will take place on the question of an inter-governmental agreement with Greece on renaming the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens must answer one question: "Do you support membership in the EU and NATO, making an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece?"
Nevertheless, the leader of the main opposition party "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (IMRO - DPMNU) Christian Mitskosky announced that he would not vote on the referendum.
As announced by the party press secretary Naum Stoilkovsky, Mitskosky decided to abstain from voting in order to express their disagreement with the agreement, which he considers "detrimental."
According to the press secretary, the current referendum decides the issue of renaming the country and nothing more, since the strategic goal of the party is to achieve NATO and EU membership.
A week ago, the President of Macedonia George Ivanov refused to participate in the referendum.
He clarified that he chose the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader looks negatively on the idea of renaming the country.
"It creates a new semi-sovereign government with a new name," remarked Ivanov.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslavian Republic - the Republic of Northern Macedonia - was signed by the heads of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece on June 17th of this year during a ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, through which runs the border between the two countries.
This agreement should decide a disagreement that has lasted for many years over the name of the country, and also mark a step towards NATO and EU membership, reports TASS.
Fire in the “mem cook’s”restaurant in Istanbul
The Nusret restaurant in Istanbul,famous for it’s chef Nusret Gekche who has a special way to salt steaks and has become a mem, caught fire during the fire show with dishes, reports Sputnik.
Supposedly, the waiter confused the additives for the steaks cooked on open fire.
As a result, the fire grew and reached the guests at the bar stand.
5 people are reported to get severe burns - two waiters and three tourists from the Czech Republic.
However, Ministry of foreign affairs of the Czech Republic claims that only two tourists suffered.
According to their information, the woman has burns on 35% of her body, and the man on 15%, RIA Novosti reports.
These are second-degree burns, in the woman’s case — with deep penetration in the skin structure.
The turkish cook Nusret Gekche is famous on the internet with his exquisite way to salt and spice steaks.
It is reported that he ordered a large-scale PR campaign in many countries. As a part of this campaign, Leonardo Di Caprio visited Nusret’s restaurant in Dubai.
On April 1, the “Old cellar” bar in Kazan was on fire.
The fire covered 450 square meters of the roof of the two-storied building.
It is reported that the fire was caused by the fats that inflamed in the kitchen hood during the shashlik preparation.
EU allocated €1.5 million to help people in Indonesia
The EU allocated €1.5 million to Indonesia to deal with the aftermath of earthquakes and tsunamis.
This was reported by the European commission press service on September 30.
To control the aid mission, European commission sent its experts in the region.
It is noted that the money will be spent for disinfection, providing food, water, temporary shelters and medicine.
Also, commission provided the Indonesian authorities with access to the satellite maps of Copernicus, European Emergency management service for estimating the damage.
The US are also ready to help in liquidating the consequences of the disaster, claimed the US Department of State press person Hiser Nauert.
Also, the US diplomatic mission in Indonesia didn’t get any information about the US casualties.
On September 28, two big earthquakes with the magnitudes of 7.2 and 7.4 happened in the Central Sulawesi province.
By the morning of September 30, seismologists detected more then 130 aftershocks.
Due to this, some island’s regions still remain without transport connection, electricity and telecommunication.
Strong earthquakes caused tsunami, with the waves of 3-5 meters.
According to the latest data, 832 died in the disaster, more than 540 received severe injuries.
Apart from this, up to 16 thousand people had to leave their homes, thousands of homes, hotels, shopping centres are destroyed.
More than 100 prisoners escaped.
The USA is behind the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan
The sharp exacerbation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26th was much discussed in Iran.
There many conferences took place involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan, and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In essence, in the territory of Afghanistan fighters waged a real territorial war against the government authorities and peaceful population of the country.
"This year set a record for the number of bloody terrorist attacks, as a result of which thousands of innocent Afghans have died," remarked Patrushev.
Afghanistan's troubles began long ago.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, the terrorist group "Al Qaeda" (prohibited in the Russian Federation), entrenched in Afghanistan, was declared to be the USA's chief enemy.
Not a month passed before America and its NATO allies began Operation Enduring Freedom there.
Seventeen years have passed.
Several thousand American troops are currently in Afghanistan territory.
Nevertheless, peaceful life is even more illusory now than before.
American forces have been driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
Despite their efforts, militants are paid off merely not to touch them.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a minority of the country's territory - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% is controlled by the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% is controlled by ISIL (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they are quickly growing.
Their goal is to create a barbarian pseudocaliphate in Central Asia - exactly the one that did not succeed in Iraq and Syria.
By all appearances, America is behind this.
America is also behind the fact that, after 17 years of its presence in the region, the production of narcotics (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased by at least a factor of 40.
The colossal growth in fields sown with opium poppy and multi-billion dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to changing the name of the country.
An agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long-term negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbor to be called Macedonia, perceiving that such a name challenged the same Greek province and Greek history.
Lyupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is gaining the right to a better future and hope for social change.
And Greece will secure its right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises and they cannot make absolutely everyone happy".
The ruling social democrats, led by the prime minister Zoran Zaev, are in favor of renaming the country.
The conservative opposition and the country's president Gjorge Ivanov are against it.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, it does not make sense for Macedonia to join the EU - it is sufficient to have partnership relations with it: “Many people who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government headed by Zaev has been imposed from the outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will bring about negative consequences.
First of all, loss of sovereignty.
Clearly there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans".
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole".
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation predicted the ruble exchange rate for 17 years ahead
The Ministry of Finance of Russia expects a gradual weakening of the ruble exchange rate - up to 73.9 rubles per dollar by 2031–2035, follows from the draft long-term budget forecast submitted to the State Duma along with the draft federal budget.
In 2021-2025, the ruble exchange rate, according to the forecast, will be 66.4 rubles per dollar, in 2026-2030 - 71.1 rubles, and in the next five years - 73.9.
The department notes that these figures are the nominal rate.
The real effective exchange rate (a figure that takes into account changes in the exchange rates of the countries that are the main trading partners of the Russian Federation) will remain stable, officials say.
As for inflation, by 2020 it will be 3.5%, and then it will stabilize at the level of about 4%, according to the Ministry of Finance.
The new film by Yorgos Lanthimos was shown at the film festival in New York.
The historical drama depicts the behind-the-scenes machinations during the reign of queen Anne - the last monarch of the Stuarts dynasty.
The leading roles were performed by Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone, Nicholas Holt.
"The script was hilarious and dazzling - Yorgos is funny and very talented.
And, of course, the casting.
All in all - a wonderful confluence of circumstances!" - says Emma Stone.
"It is not often that you come home, and you are asked: "So, how was work?", and you answer: Can you imagine, I threw oranges at a naked man.
An unusual job, isn't it?" - adds Nicholas Holt.
The international premiere of the film took place at the 75th Venice Festival.
In wide release in the United States, "The Favourite" will be released in November, and in Russia it will appear on the screens in January next year.

Peskov replied about the possible support of Serbia on Kosovo
The spokesperson of Russian president Vladimir Putin believes it is too early to discuss whether Russia will help Serbia after conflict exacerbation in Kosovo.
First, there should be talks between the two country leaders, he said.
The Kremlin representative told this to the “Moscow speaking” radio on Sunday, September 30.
On September 29, the Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić said that he is intended to discuss the Kosovo situation with the Russian president Vladimir Putin at the upcoming meeting in Moscow on October 2.
Also, the Serbian leader was planning to ask Moscow for support in the situation, noting that it doesn’t mean military support.
Vučić noted that he would like to preserve piece in the region and will make everything possible for it.
Earlier on that day, the Serbian president ordered to get the country’s military forces fully operational.
TV report left badly shaken after sex pest kisses her live on air
A TV reporter has condemned a stranger who pretended to grope her backside then kissed her live on air.
Sara Rivest recoiled at the man's attempted embrace while reporting on a bourbon festival in Louisville, Kentucky, on Wednesday.
She said "Ooohkay," then "That was not appropriate, let's go to the story," as she regained her composure live on TV station WAVE.
The pest has been named as Eric Goodman, with Goodman now charged with misdemeanor harassment with physical contact.
He has been issued a summons to appear in court.
After their encounter, Rivest shared a clip on Twitter, writing: "Hey mister, here's your 3 seconds of fame. How about you not touch me? Thanks!!"
And Rivest appeared on WAVE's evening news bulletin Monday to condemn the man again.
She conceded that people were perfectly entitled to behave foolishly in her shot while she was reporting from a public place.
Rivest added: "But when you put your hands on me or anyone else without their approval, that is wrong."
She said incidents like the one caught on camera are "a violation and all-too-common occurrence."
The reporter said she was annoyed at herself for laughing when the man kissed her, but blamed it on an instantaneous, nervous reaction to the situation.
She continued: "I was shocked, but my nervous laughter does not equate to approval of his actions.
It was an exertion of power over me, a woman - trying to do her job - who couldn't stop him.
This embarrassed me, and it made me feel uncomfortable and powerless."
Rivest went on to share a text from her dad calling the pest a "jerk," which added: "If I had been there, I'd have dropped him."
Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament - Joyce McMillan
Once, long ago, a committee I sat on had some dealings with people from Buckingham Palace; not the Royal Family itself, but a small group of senior officials.
I suppose that even 20 years on, it's a beheading offence to give precise details of what they said on the subject of the Queen's role in the planned official opening of the new Scottish Parliament, on 1 July 1999; but I can say that they were an impressive crew, much more politically savvy about the constitutional nuances of devolution than most UK Government representatives at the time, and much more sharply aware - given their vast experience across the Commonwealth - that political self-determination is one thing, and the role of the monarch as head of state is another.
Amid all the sound, fury, and swings of the constitutional wrecking-ball that have accompanied the latest traumatic episode in Britain's Brexit crisis, one question has therefore been nagging at the back of my mind; the question of what exactly happened on the morning of 28 August, when Jacob Rees-Mogg, as Lord President of the Council, presented himself at Balmoral, where the Queen was on her usual late summer holiday, to seek the royal assent to the exceptional five-week prorogation of Parliament proposed by the Prime Minister.
This is, of course, a mere sub-plot in the wider Brexit drama which reached such an appalling crisis in the Commons on Wednesday night, with the Prime Minister dismissing the unanimous decision of 11 Supreme Court judges as "wrong," inciting warlike attitudes by using terms like "surrender" and "betrayal" in relation to Brexit, and dismissing as "humbug" the fears for their own safety of women MP's - friends and allies of the murdered MP Jo Cox - who are now subjected to a daily barrage of Brexit-related hate mail.
Yet it is a sub-plot worthy of a one-act play in its own right; and perhaps not one of those jolly, reassuring ones in which the Queen is portrayed as an infinitely wise and perceptive old lady, who has seen 13 prime ministers come and go, and will doubtless outlast the 14th.
For the truth is that on that day, the Queen and her advisers seem to have made an error of judgment, of the kind they have almost entirely avoided, in her 67-year reign to date; and arguably a much more serious one than the intervention in the Scottish independence referendum suggested by David Cameron in his memoir, which, after all, amounted to no more than the Queen suggesting people "think carefully" before casting their votes, a phrase which only a dyed-in-the-wool Unionist would interpret as meaning that they should necessarily vote for the status quo.
This time, though, warning bells should have sounded in the royal household as soon as they heard that the new Prime Minister was proposing such a long prorogation in the run-up to the Brexit deadline date; and a couple of quick concerned phone calls from palace to Downing Street should have been enough to persuade the PM to shorten his pre-Queen's Speech prorogation to the usual length of a few days or a week.
To the royal household, after all, past custom and practice is 99 per cent of the law.
So what went wrong?
We will probably never know, or not for decades.
It may be that the Queen and her advisers simply felt that they did not want to question a new government trying to implement a referendum result, however narrow.
It may be that Johnson and Rees-Mogg genuinely caught the Queen off guard, at a holiday period when many key people were not available.
Or it may be, as some republican thinkers would suggest, that the whole idea of the Queen as a wise and moderate sovereign, who always hopes to promote the wellbeing of her subjects, is simply another layer of royalist mythology, disguising an edifice of wealth and inherited privilege which, under stress, will unhesitatingly assist a right-wing government in undermining institutions - Scottish, British or European - that might threaten that traditional power structure.
It is 42 years, after all, since punk poet John Lydon of the Sex Pistols first noisily linked the Queen with the idea of a "fascist regime"; and although the history of postwar Europe strongly suggests that there is no inevitable connection between royalty and reactionary politics, it can be argued that the 1970s punk movement at least tried to open up a conversation about monarchy and democracy, one which the UK has since failed to pursue.
Whatever the truth about the Queen's role in the prorogation, though, this much is clear; that as the current Brexit crisis is testing Britain's unwritten constitution to its limits, and provoking a dangerous moment of open constitutional warfare among government, parliament and the courts, it has also succeeded in undermining the monarch's conventional stabilising role in that constitution, associating her with a rash act that has now been declared unlawful, by a government that commands no parliamentary majority.
The global merchants of democratic instability and breakdown - the Putins and Bannons, with their armies of hate-mongering internet bots - must be delighted by the spectacular progress of their project, over just three years, in one of the world's most stable democracies.
And Scotland, which has not been the primary target of this destabilisation, must now soon be given a second chance to consider its position, in relation to a UK so radically changed by Brexit.
In 1977, Lydon and the Sex Pistols famously warned that "there is no future for you, in England's dreaming."
Yet now, England's fierce dream of a glorious past, filtered through layers of 21st-century lies and delusion, is starting to shape all of our futures on these islands; and we will all have to live in that landscape of dream or nightmare, until we find our own ways - with or without the Queen, and inside or outside the UK - of resisting the lies, rejecting the illusion, and coming together to re-engage with reality of our lives, as citizens of the 21st century.
How much is Kelvin Fletcher paid for Strictly, who is his wife and why did he leave Emmerdale?
FORMER Emmerdale cast member Kelvin Fletcher has swapped the Dales for the dancefloor on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing 2019.
But what do we know about him?
How much is Kelvin Flecther being paid for Strictly Come Dancing?
The father-of-one is said to have been paid something in the region of £25,000 and £40,000 to take part in the 17th series of Strictly Come Dancing.
The Sun previously reported that each celebrity is given a standard £25,000 payment for joining.
For those who stay until the end of October the fee rises to £40,000.
However, his earnings could increase significantly if he makes it to the quarter-finals as he will pocket £60,000.
With Kelvin being a strong competitor there is every possibility he could walk away with £100,000 if he wins the entire competition.
Why did Kelvin Fletcher leave Emmerdale?
Kelvin first joined Emmerdale at the tender age of six-years-old in 1996.
He played the part of Andy Sugden for 20 years, before quitting the role in 2016 for good.
During an appearance on This Morning, the actor opened up about his decision to leave the ITV soap.
Speaking to host Emmon Holmes and Ruth Langsford, he explained: "Twenty years is a long time.
It's been an incredible twenty years.
I am so grateful to Emmerdale.
Throughout that period I have always had a real sense of fulfillment and purpose."
He added: "What started out as a hobby at six years old - I was then able to do something like that every day on a professional platform on one of the country's greatest shows.
I have been extremely lucky.
Looking back over 20 years it has been a rollercoaster and for me it's give me passion to leave and continue."
Wollstonecraft's only house for sale going under the hammer
The north shore housing market is in the grip of a stock shortage, especially in the popular suburb of Wollstonecraft.
According to realestate.com.au, there are just 11 properties currently on the market.
Only one of them is a house, and by this time tomorrow it will likely be sold.
The four-bedroom house at 18 Tryon Ave , is scheduled to go under the hammer at 2pm (Saturday, September 28), and will be open for inspection and registration from 1.15pm.
It has a price guide of $2.75 million.
David Hill, of Raine&Horne HM Group, said the home was located in the only street on the Wollstonecraft peninsula that has no conservation restrictions.
This offers plenty of opportunities for a major renovation or knockdown/rebuild (subject to council approval).
"It's very rare for this type of thing to come up," he said.
The property has a lot of potential and we have had a lot of interest.
He said almost 100 groups had seen the property in the lead up to tomorrow's auction.
According to CoreLogic, there hasn't been a house sale in Tryon Ave since 2015.
This property hasn't changed hands since 1987.
The four-bedroom, full-brick home offers plenty of space and is directly opposite Badangi Reserve.
It is also within walking distance of Wollstonecraft Station, Berry Island Reserve and the harbour foreshores.
Drug-driving crashes double in just five years as RAC accuses government of 'complacency'
Number of road accidents caused by drug-driving more than doubled in 5 years
DfT said 1,321 crashes were caused by drivers under influence of drugs last year
RAC said statistics worrying, accused the Government of complacency
The number of road accidents caused by drug-driving has more than doubled in five years.
There were 1,321 crashes caused by drivers under the influence of drugs last year, compared to 594 in 2013, the Department for Transport (DfT) said on Thursday.
Worse, drugs were a factor in 80 road deaths last year - compared to just 31 six years ago.
The RAC Foundation said the statistics are 'worrying', and it has accused the Government of complacency over road safety.
Motorway deaths also rose despite moves to make them safer, with 107 fatalities last year - up eight per cent on 2017.
Motoring groups fear the removal of hard shoulders on so-called 'smart motorways' where stricken drivers have no choice but to stop in 'live' lanes.
They have emergency lay-bys every 1.5 miles instead.
It is not clear how many of the recorded deaths were on smart motorways, which are to be renamed 'digital roads' and currently account for at least 416 miles of Britain's motorways.
That is set to almost double to 788 miles by April 2025 under the Government's road strategy.
By contrast, deaths on rural roads were down three per cent last year from the year before.
And the DfT statistics suggest that tougher penalties on mobile phone use are working.
Although the number of road deaths caused by using handsets rose from 32 in 2016 to 33 in 2017, it fell to 25 last year.
New laws against using a mobile phone behind the wheel were introduced in 2017 after a Daily Mail campaign.
The number of accidents also decreased, from 478 in 2016 to 431 in 2017 and 423 last year.
RAC head of policy Nicholas Lyes said: 'Of particular concern are the rises in fatalities among older age groups and a spike in motorway fatalities.
Some worrying trends are emerging here that require immediate investigation, to understand the reasons for these increases and what can be done to reduce them.
'In addition, the Government's data suggests an increase in motorway collisions where at least one driver has been under the influence of illegal drugs.'
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: 'We are progressing more than 70 different measures to help improve safety, for everyone from infants in car seats to those with years of driving experience.
I have also asked the Department to urgently look at technological interventions to help reduce the number of young drivers killed."
African Cooperation On Peace 'Increasingly Strong', Security Council Told
African countries are building increasingly strong partnerships for advancing peace and security, as well as inclusive sustainable development across the continent, the Security Council heard on Thursday, during a briefing by the UN Secretary-General's Chef de Cabinet, Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti.
Ms. Viotti recognized the African Union and Member States' success in achieving important milestones in their pursuit for higher effectiveness, self-reliance and cooperation, and welcomed the work of the African Union Mediation Support Unit and the FemWise Network of African Women in Conflict Prevention and Mediation, which are, she said, "boosting capacity to defuse crises and making such efforts more inclusive."
Progress evident at regional and country level
Ms. Viotti went on to outline some of the progress being made in certain African countries, such as the peace talks, led by the African Union, in the Central African Republic which led a Political Agreement which is being overseen by the UN; the signing of a Constitutional Declaration in Sudan, which has allowed for the establishment of a civilian-led government, following efforts led by Ethiopia and the African Union (AU), with UN support; and free and fair elections in Madagascar, supported by the Southern Africa Development Community, the African Union, and UN.
Cooperation between the UN, African Union and other partners in the area of elections is growing, said Ms. Viotti, citing visits organized by the UN Office for West Africa to several countries, ahead of legislative or presidential elections, over the last two years.
The UN and AU, she continued, are cooperating closely to ensure that the voices of women and youth are integral to peace processes, and both organizations have youth envoys and strategies, acting as advocates and agents of change.
More effective support needed from international community
Despite the many examples of progress, Ms. Viotti declared that the international community needs to do much more to support African efforts.
For example, more predictable, flexible and sustainable financing for African Union-led peace support operations is needed; more political will and resources for peacebuilding and sustaining peace efforts; and active support for the AU Initiative on Silencing the Guns.
"Building partnerships and harnessing their power requires long-term vision and commitment," Ms. Viotti told the Security Council, adding that the Secretary-General is looking forward to "even greater partnership and collaboration, enabling the African Union to achieve its 2063 vision of equitable, people-centred transformation and lasting peace and security."
Belfast High Court dismisses no-deal Brexit case
The Court of Appeal in Belfast has dismissed an application that the UK government's Brexit policy will damage the Northern Ireland peace process.
Three applicants appealed against a Belfast High Court judgment that rejected their challenge against the UK government's handling of the Brexit process.
One of the applicants was high-profile victims' campaigner Raymond McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in 1997.
It comes after the UK Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully in shutting down parliament for five weeks.
The three-judge Court of Appeal, led by the region's Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, gave their judgment on Friday morning.
The three challenges focused on various aspects of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.
One that argued the Government's Brexit policy will damage the Northern Ireland peace process was previously dismissed by the High Court.
During the appeal hearing last week, Mr McCord's barrister Ronan Lavery QC told the court that if a Brexit extension could not be secured by the government in the absence of a deal, then the default position should be halting Brexit - through the revocation of Article 50 - rather than exiting with no deal.
Mr McCord, who was not at court due to ill health, said he would study the Belfast Court of Appeal judgment with his lawyer.
"I, along with many other people, believe that it will affect the peace process," he said.
I hope I am proven wrong.
We did not take this case to alarm people, it is what I believe in.
"It would be nice if in the coming years people can come across and say: "Look Raymond, you were wrong."
It did not affect the peace process.
I don't want it to affect the peace process.
I don't want people to go through what my family and members of other families have went through.
I respect the judgment of the Appeal Court in every way, I believe the judges sitting there are amongst the best judges in the UK.
I have to respect their judgment.
However, it is a fear I have that the peace process will be affected."
Shirley Ballas health: Strictly star to remove breast implants to reduce cancer risk
Head judge of Strictly Come Dancing, Shirley Ballas, 59, announced that she will be having her breast implants removed after several cancer diagnoses in her family.
Shirley's mother and aunt both have cancer and as such she made the decision to remove her implants to reduce her risk.
According to The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there is a possible association between breast implants and the development of breast-implant associated anapaestic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), an uncommon cancer of the immune system.
The FDA believes that women with breast implants that have textured surfaces have a very low but increased risk of developing BIA-ALCL.
However, FDA did note that it doesn't necessarily mean that implant cause it and further research is need to understand the relationship between the condition and breast implants.
Shirley had received a health warning following a mammogram and subsequently made the brave decision to remove her implants.
Speaking to The Sun, Shirley was told "there's no guarantee that we can ever really see behind the back of the implants," which made her realise it could be difficult for doctors to detect any cancers.
Shirley said: "I'm scheduled for the operation on Tuesday, October 29th."
My doctor says I have recuperation of a week, but I want to do Strictly on the Saturday night.
Joking that "it's not like I have to dance and do the cha cha cha or the samba."
I have spoke to the BBC and they have been very, very supportive.
They said you have to do what you feel most comfortable for your health.
Despite the FDA announcing more research is needed on the subject of implants and its correlation to breast cancer, Shirley has decided not to take any chances and believes it has impacted her health negatively.
There are rumours that the scar tissues cause chronic fatigue which I have suffered with even over the last year.
Usually I don't get tired and I'm like an Energizer bunny.
But if they take out the scar tissue it would involve bigger surgery and perhaps a reconstruction.
But I don't want any implants in.
I don't want any foreign bodies in my body.
Symptoms of breast cancer include a lump in the breast, a change in the size or shape of the breast, a dimpling of the skin or thickening in the breast tissue, an inverted nipple, a rash on the nipple, discharge, or a swelling in the armpit.
If you suspect you or anyone you may know might have these signs it's imperative to speak with your GP who will recommend you to a specialist if needs be.
'Grey's Anatomy' Season 16 debuted and people have feelings
The hit ABC drama debuted it's new season Thursday night and it was a lot.
From Amelia Shepherd (played by Caterina Scorsone) using her date with Atticus Lincoln a.k.a. Dr. Link (Chris Carmack) to float the idea of a three-way, to Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) facing the threat of losing her medical license, there was plenty of "OMG" moments.
But what seemed to really mess up social media was the revelation that Amelia might be pregnant -- which of course was not the kind of threesome she was envisioning.
"Omg the new episode of grey's anatomy... amelia... sweetie," one person tweeted.
Character Jo Karev (Camilla Luddington) also got some major support from husband Alex (Justin Chambers) after she checked into a psychiatric facility for 30 days to deal with her issues.
He dropped to one knee and proposed to her all over again.
"Marry me again, please," Alex said.
No. of women in science field far from satisfactory; need to increase participation: President Kovind
President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday said the participation of women in the field of science in the country is far from satisfactory and steps need to be taken to ensure greater involvement of girl students in the area.
In his address on the 78th foundation day celebrations of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), he said achievements in the field of science and technology will become more wholesome and desirable if there is a greater participation of girl students and of women in this area.
In this context, he said Project Director of Chandrayaan-2 mission M Vanitha and Mission Director Ritu Karidhal have become household names.
We have to take the necessary steps to ensure greater participation of girl students and of women in science and technology.
"When this happens, our scientific achievements will become even more wholesome and more desirable," the President said.
"None of our successes will have any meaning without equal opportunities for our girl-children," he added.
Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan, Principal Scientific Advisor K VijayRaghavan and CSIR Director General Shekhar Mande were also present at the event.
Mr Kovind called upon the scientific community to take calculated risk.
There, he said, lies the possibility of developing truly transformative technologies and innovations.
He said the academic, scientific institutions, industry and entrepreneurs must collaborate to ensure that scientific research can move from labs to industry, agricultural fields, incubation centres and start-ups.
Mr Vardhan also presented the President a Fuel Cell Prototype developed by CSIR labs.
This is the first indigenous prototype and the fuel cells use hydrogen to produce electricity.
Fast broadband roll-out held up by legal requirement on landlords
Thousands of central London residents are being "locked out" of the quickest broadband by a legal requirement for landlords to give permission before fibre can be installed.
Bosses at Openreach, the firm responsible for linking up homes to fibre networks capable of supporting "ultrafast" broadband, say they face huge obstacles in securing so-called "wayleave" agreements that give them the right to enter apartment or office blocks.
The problem is most acute in the City where complex layers of foreign ownership have made it hard to identify who the freeholders are, resulting in years of costly delay.
Figures from Openreach suggest it has been unable to gain consent from the owners of 848 high-rise buildings - containing 9,941 residential or business premises - in the City alone.
Affected residents have spoken of their frustration at being left with slow internet speeds in the heart of the Square Mile.
Civil servant Tim Figures, who lives in an apartment near the Gherkin tower, said he can access only "basic" broadband services despite lobbying for more than a year for fibre to be installed.
It means it can take up to an hour to download a single TV episode and uploading files is "incredibly slow."
With fibre, downloading an entire HD film takes a few minutes.
The 48-year-old said: "Working from home can cause huge problems if I need to do anything beyond a basic email."
Mr Figures said the managing agent of his building had approached the freeholder about access for Openreach but it had refused to sign a wayleave agreement.
He added: "It's incredibly frustrating, we're just stuck in this legal limbo."
The freeholder doesn't have to pay anything, there is no liability, all they have to do is sign an agreement giving Openreach permission to lay cables.
Openreach boss Chris Selly said he wants a change in the law to give the company the same legal rights to enter as gas, electricity and water suppliers.
Kim Mears, Openreach's head of strategic infrastructure development, said the firm had been able to access only 44 per cent of City buildings, adding: "It's a real tortuous drawn-out process."
Joker is chilling, unnerving and absolutely brilliant
Joaquin Phoenix turns in an Oscar worthy performance as a comic-book villain whose power once lay in his ambiguous mythology, but has now been bolstered in Joker by an unflinching deep dive into his origins.
Pulling back the curtain on the Joker was a risk, but it's one that pays off hugely here as Phoenix's portrayal of the character, who has been played many ways by many actors to varying degrees of success, is unique and if anything, more terrifying, as this story is so grounded in a quasi-reality and the most real-worldly Gotham we've seen.
What transpires on screen is chilling, unnerving, completely compelling, anxiety-inducing, sleep-disturbing, and absolutely brilliant.
Joker is a character study that explores how a mentally ill aspiring stand-up comedian, Arthur Fleck, becomes the homicidal clown we're familiar with, and the film deftly walks the tightrope of making him a somewhat sympathetic character without pushing this aspect too far.
The balancing act is truly engaging.
Phoenix gives the performance of the year here, but DeNiro is also at the top of his game once again and his involvement in the project really solidifies the Scorsese-ian undertones that pepper the film.
This is not a comic-book movie and aside from a few hat-tips to Batman lore, it is completely its own beast, and that is precisely why it works so well; there is no format, there is no convention and there are no rules.
You might not put on a happy face for a while after the credits roll, but it is so worth the weird dreams that will likely follow.
Saudi Arabia To Offer Tourist Visas For First Time, Abolish Abaya Rule
Visas in Saudi are currently restricted to expat workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims.
Saudi Arabia said Friday it will offer tourist visas for the first time, opening up the ultra-conservative kingdom to holidaymakers as part of a push to diversify its economy away from oil.
Kickstarting tourism is one of the centrepieces of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 reform programme to prepare the biggest Arab economy for a post-oil era.
The announcement comes just two weeks after devastating attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure -- blamed by Washington on Iran -- which roiled global energy markets and raised fears of a wider regional conflict.
"Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," tourism chief Ahmed al-Khateeb said in a statement.
Visitors will be surprised... by the treasures we have to share -- five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, a vibrant local culture and breathtaking natural beauty.
Saudi Arabia will open applications for online tourist visas to citizens of 49 countries on Saturday, Bloomberg News quoted Khateeb as saying.
Khateeb said the kingdom will also ease its strict dress code for foreign women, allowing them to go without the body-shrouding abaya robe that is still mandatory public wear for Saudi women.
Foreign women, however, will be required to wear "modest clothing," he added, without elaborating.
Visas in the desert kingdom, endowed with rich bedouin heritage and archaeological sites, are currently restricted to expat workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims travelling to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
In a rare move, Saudi Arabia last year began issuing temporary visas to visitors to attend sporting and cultural events in a bid to kickstart tourism.
But the austere kingdom, which forbids alcohol and has a strict social code, is seen by many as a hard sell for tourists.
Prince Mohammed is seeking to change that through a sweeping liberalisation drive that has brought new cinemas, mixed-gender concerts and sporting extravaganzas to Saudi Arabia.
International criticism of the kingdom's human rights record, including the gruesome murder last year of critic Jamal Khashoggi and a crackdown on female activists, could further put off foreign visitors, observers say.
Fears of a regional conflict after the September 14 attacks on state oil giant Aramco may also dampen the kingdom's appeal to holidaymakers.
The government, reeling from low oil prices, says it hopes tourism will contribute up to 10 percent of the gross domestic product by 2030, compared to three percent currently.
It says by 2030 it aims to attract up to 100 million annual visits by both domestic and foreign tourists.
But the kingdom currently lacks the infrastructure to accomodate visitors in such high numbers, with officials estimating 500,000 new hotel rooms will be required nationwide over the coming decade.
The sector is expected to create up to one million tourism jobs, the government says, as it battles high youth unemployment.
Saudi Arabia has splurged billions in an attempt to build a tourism industry from scratch.
In 2017, the kingdom announced a multi-billion dollar project to turn 50 islands and other pristine sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts.
Last year, construction of Qiddiya "entertainment city" was launched near Riyadh, which would include high-end theme parks, motor sport facilities and a safari area.
The country is also developing historic sites such as the centuries-old Mada'in Saleh, home to sandstone tombs of the same civilisation which built the Jordanian city of Petra.
An agreement formalizing public access to state-owned lands has been a good deal for the two Idaho agencies involved as well as hunters, anglers and recreationists, state officials said Thursday.
The Idaho Department of Lands and Idaho Department of Fish and Game said that both sides are benefiting from the 2018 agreement.
Fish and Game through fees it collects from hunters and anglers is paying the Lands Department $580,000 annually, with about a fourth of that in law enforcement patrols.
The agreement involves access to about 3,750 square miles (9,700 square kilometers) of Idaho endowment lands.
Idaho received endowment lands in 1890 when it became a state.
Most of the money is generated through logging.
The lands have always been open to the public, but state officials say the agreement has increased awareness that they are accessible to hunters, anglers and others.
"And the state has been very open that they're welcome there," said Roger Phillips, spokesman for Fish and Game.
Phillips and Bill Haagenson, an administrator at the Lands Department, said it's difficult to quantify how many visitors are heading for state lands following the agreement.
But anecdotally, each said, the numbers appear to be growing.
"I think we can say that recreation use on endowment lands has been and continues to increase," Haagenson said.
As our population grows, we're seeing more recreation.
Miscreants or public lands slobs occasionally show up, but state officials say most visitors have been respectful and responsible.
About 96 percent of endowment lands are accessible by foot or boat.
Maps of accessible endowment lands are available on Fish and Game's website.
There are also smartphone apps available that show state, federal and private lands while a person moves across the landscape.
That's particularly useful for hunters, said Phillips, who uses an app that turns the screen blue for state land.
"If you're standing in that blue patch, you know you're in pretty good shape," he said.
Because the Idaho Constitution requires state lands to be used to generate money, there was some concern individuals or companies could pay to lease state lands, cutting off public access.
Such a request is still possible.
A decision on that would be up to the Idaho Land Board, comprised of Republican Gov. Brad Little and four other statewide elected officials, who manage endowment lands and direct the Lands Department.
The agreement between the Lands Department and Fish and Game "gives the board another piece of information to consider should an application for use come in," Haagenson said.
Idaho endowment lands are somewhat scattered, the state having received 1-mile (2.6-kilometer) square sections when it became a state.
Over the years, exchanges or sales left the current configuration with some remaining isolated sections, but many others accumulated into blocks of sections, particularly in northern and central Idaho.
"There's a lot of good timberland in central Idaho that provides really good wildlife habitat," Phillips said.
A lot of that is intertwined with national forest land.
Holiday Inn Delhi Aerocity Posh Delhi Hotel To Be Seized In Case Against Deepak Talwar
The value of Holiday Inn is Rs 127 crore.
Deepak Talwar is currently in judicial custody
A special PMLA authority has confirmed the attachment of hotel Holiday Inn, worth over Rs 127 crore, located in the upscale Aerocity area in the national capital in connection with a money laundering case against alleged aviation lobbyist Deepak Talwar, the Enforcement Directorate said on Friday.
The attachment order, issued by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on March 28, has been confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on September 19, the agency said in a statement.
The agency, with the approval obtained from the authority, will now be able to seize the hotel, a senior official said.
The lobbyist was deported from Dubai in January and arrested by the agency in a PMLA case booked against him and others.
The proceeds of crime allegedly generated by Deepak Talwar, from kickbacks received in lieu of securing favourable air traffic rights, were integrated in a company Wave Hospitality Private Limited, the agency said.
It alleged that this company was "beneficially owned and controlled" by Deepak Talwar in the name of his son, Aditya Talwar.
This alleged tainted money was used to construct hotel Holiday Inn, next to the Indira Gandhi International Airport, the ED charged.
The posh hotel boasts of some of the most expensive boarding and dining facilities in the Aerocity complex that was constructed few years ago for international and domestic air passengers transiting through Delhi.
The agency had earlier said that Deepak Talwar "illegally engaged in liasoning/lobbying with politicians, ministers and other public servants and officials of the Ministry of Civil Aviation for airlines such as Emirates, Air Arabia and Qatar Airways for securing undue benefits for them" during the tenure of the UPA government.
"He (Talwar) illegally managed to secure favourable traffic rights for these airlines during 2008-09 at the cost of national carrier, Air India," the agency said.
Investigation revealed that in lieu of securing favourable traffic rights, these airlines made payments to the tune of Rs 272 crore to Talwar during 2008-09, it said.
"It has been revealed that Talwar created a web of entities owned by him and his family members in India and international offshore havens to launder proceeds of crime of Rs 272 crore received from foreign airlines," ED had said.
"Part of these payments were made to an account in Bank of Singapore, belonging to a company Asiafield Limited registered in the British Virgin Islands and beneficially owned by Deepak Talwar," it added.
Wells Fargo taps BNY Mellon's Charles Scharf as CEO
Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) named banking veteran Charles Scharf as chief executive officer on Friday, the lender's third CEO since a wide-ranging sales scandal erupted three years ago.
Scharf will take over from interim CEO Allen Parker, who was thrust into the position in March when former CEO Tim Sloan resigned abruptly.
Sloan had said increased pressure from politicians and regulators had become a distraction in running the scandal-plagued bank.
Scharf will take charge at a time when the bank is under a regulatory microscope and is working at rebuilding its tarnished reputation following the scandal.
Internal and regulatory probes since the scandal have uncovered other issues in each of the bank's primary businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines, penalties and an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve.
Wells Fargo's board has been shuffled many times since the scandal, with more than half of its independent directors joining the board after 2016.
Most recently, Scharf was heading Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N).
Before joining the custodian bank, he held the top job at Visa Inc (V.N), the world's largest payment network.
Separately, BNY Mellon named finance head Thomas Gibbons as its CEO on an interim basis.
The bank also said Scharf had forfeited all of his equity and incentive awards which were unvested as of Thursday.
KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said he was unsure what to expect from Scharf as Wells Fargo's CEO since his tenure at Bank of New York Mellon lasted only for two years.
"Scharf's first task will be appeasing regulators and making the changes necessary to remove the asset cap currently in place," Kleinhanzl said.
Scharf, 54, started his career in 1987 at Commercial Credit Corp, a consumer finance company run by Jamie Dimon and Sandy Weill - executives who went on to lead two of America's biggest banks.
He was named Dimon's assistant six months into the job at Commercial Credit, according to an alumni magazine for the NYU stern business school.
Scharf will start in his new role next month, Wells Fargo said in a statement.
"He moves from a bank with far less retail business than Wells Fargo, so he will face a steep learning curve," said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.
The lender's board had considered keeping Parker as CEO on a permanent basis even after saying they would seek an outsider to fill the role, sources had told Reuters in June.
Wells Fargo said Scharf's base salary at the bank would be $2.5 million - nearly the same as Sloan's base pay in 2018.
Regulatory filings showed that Scharf's total compensation for 2018 at BNY was $9.4 million.
Sloan's total compensation for the year was $18.4 million.
Shares of Wells Fargo were up nearly 3.2% at $50.44 in premarket trading.

Parents Arrested In Suspicious Death Of 4-Year-Old Palmdale Boy Noah Cuatro - CBS Los Angeles
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) - The parents of 4-year-old Palmdale boy Noah Cuatro who died in July under suspicious circumstances were arrested Thursday, officials confirmed.
Jose Cuatro and Ursula Juarez were arrested for the murder of their son, Noah, on September 26, 2019, at approximately 8:00 a.m., the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Dept. announced.
The two were booked at Palmdale Sheriff's Station and a search warrant was served at their residence in an attempt to recover any additional evidence related to Noah's murder.
Noah had been ordered by a court back in May to be removed from his parents' custody over concerns about abuse.
He was never removed from the home and placed in foster care and on the afternoon of July 5, Noah's parents called 911 to report that he was drowning in a pool at an apartment complex in the 1200 block of East Avenue S, the L.A. County Sheriff's Department reports.
Noah was rushed by ambulance to a local hospital.
He died the following morning, on July 6.
Hospital staff found signs of trauma on Noah's body and determined there were issues with his parents' explanation for his cause of death.
Noah's three siblings had since been removed from the home and the sheriff's department launched an investigation.
DCFS had previously investigated several reports of abuse in Noah's home.
Noah's maternal great-grandmother Eva Hernandez told CBSLA that he was in and out of foster care his entire life.
"DCFS has blood on its hands," said Hernandez's attorney Brian Claypool.
Even though we're talking today about the arrest of his parents, we will be back some point in the future to hold that agency accountable for the death of this little boy.
In 2016, according to the Times, Noah was removed from the home and placed in foster care for two years.
He was returned to his parents' custody in November 2018.
Hernandez said she often cared for her great-grandson.
"He begged me, "grandma, let me stay, don't do this to me, don't send me back,"" Hernandez said.
It's hard because I remember every word he used to tell me.
Noah's parents are being held on $1 million bail each and are due in court Monday, Sept.
WeWork's Neumann voted to oust himself as CEO after failed IPO
When WeWork's directors voted on Tuesday to oust Adam Neumann as chief executive after a failed attempt to take the office-sharing startup public, Neumann cast his vote against himself, according to three people familiar with the situation.
The vote by Neumann, who remains non-executive chairman but gave up majority control of the company he co-founded, was the culmination of a stunning coup to remove him led by his biggest backer, Masayoshi Son, the billionaire CEO of SoftBank Group, the sources said.
Neumann's downfall came after WeWork's parent, We Company, spent months preparing for an initial public offering, only to have to postpone its plans last week, as estimates of its value fell by tens of billions of dollars amid investor concerns about its corporate governance under Neumann, 40, and its ability to generate a profit.
The falling estimates came as a shock to Son, who had plowed more than $10 billion into WeWork, the last investment at a $47 billion valuation, according to three people familiar with the matter.
At that level, WeWork was the world's fourth-most valuable private startup, according to data firm CB Insights.
By the time the IPO was pulled, estimates of WeWork's value had come down as low as $10 billion.
By last weekend, some WeWork directors started to lay the groundwork for Neumann's departure, according to a source familiar with the seven-member board's deliberations.
The notion would have been unthinkable only a few months ago, with the WeWork brand strongly tied to the flamboyant, freewheeling Israel-born entrepreneur who has said that his company's mission was to "elevate the world's consciousness."
The substance of the message to Neumann from them: "Listen, this IPO has gotten distracted by you," the source said.
Neumann decided to back the management changes because he became convinced they were in the best interest of the company, according to a person close to him.
Neumann owns about a quarter of WeWork, sources have previously said, tying much of his wealth to the company.
WeWork has not disclosed what percentage of the company he owns.
Neumann did not respond to calls and emails requesting an interview.
SoftBank and WeWork declined to comment.
Rugby World Cup 2019: Warren Gatland announces Wales line-up for Australia showdown
Warren Gatland has named an unchanged team for Wales' Pool D showdown against Australia, with Alun Wyn Jones set to become the country's most-capped player when he leads his side out in Tokyo.
The Wales skipper wins his 130th cap, breaking the previous record held by prop Gethin Jenkins.
Gatland has placed his faith in the starting XV that secured a 43-14 victory over Georgia four days ago, this despite the knocks suffered by centre Hadleigh Parkes and hooker Ken Owens.
There is one switch among the replacements, with Ospreys centre Owen Watkin taking over from Leigh Halfpenny.
Gatland's side features nine survivors from Wales' narrow win against the Wallabies last November.
There are also further opportunities for prop Wyn Jones and flanker Aaron Wainwright after they made their Rugby World Cup debuts in the Georgia game.
And flanker Aaron Shingler will again provide second-row bench cover for starting locks Jake Ball and Alun Wyn Jones.
Sunday's clash at the Tokyo Stadium will likely decide the winner of Pool D, setting up a potential quarter-final against either France or Argentina.
Should Australia claim victory - in what would make for their 14th win from the last 15 meetings between these two sides - Gatland's men could find themselves on a collision course for a last-eight encounter with England.
Buy a classic Guardian photograph: Myanmar by David Levene
In 2016, Guardian photographer David Levene and architecture critic Oliver Wainwright visited Yangon to document its changing face, amid huge political upheaval and a flood of foreign investment.
Its crumbling British colonial architecture, and street life in particular, provided a rich source of stories and images.
Here, a young man sells fruit at a roadside stall beneath a rudimentary striplight (Wainwright is pictured just beyond him, wearing a blue T-shirt).
"There was a specific time at the end of the day, when daylight was failing and the streetlights came on, when everything seemed to glow," says Levene.
World Cup is shop window that will improve team, says Canada captain
Canada rugby captain Tyler Ardron is under no illusions of the monumentality of the task facing his side in their next two World Cup fixtures but said it would put his players in the "shop window" and ultimately help improve the team in the long run.
The North Americans were beaten 48-7 by Italy in their Pool B opener at Fukuoka Hakatanomori Stadium on Thursday and now face three-times world champions New Zealand on Oct. 2 in Oita before meeting South Africa on Oct. 8 in Kobe.
Ardron, one of the few Canadians playing in a top-tier club competition - for New Zealand club Waikato Chiefs in the international Super Rugby competition - recognized his side were unlikely to upset either of the southern hemisphere nations.
"We're at the World Cup to play against the best (and)... for this game (against Italy) we were definitely not the favorites and that showed on the scoreboard," Ardron said.
(Against New Zealand) we have to go out and put out something that we are proud of.
For a lot of guys this is a shop window and hopefully some of them can put on a hell of a performance out there and get a contract.
That would be a win for us.
Wins on the field may be few and far between for tier-two nations at the tournament, such as Uruguay's victory over Fiji in Kamaishi on Wednesday.
The Italians, however, were in no mood to allow a second shock within the space of 24 hours and demonstrated the benefits of having a team comprised of full-time professionals playing regular test matches.
Canada coach Kingsley Jones, however, said Thursday's performance had been a major step up for his side, which has struggled internationally for a number of years and was the last to qualify for the tournament.
The advent of Major League Rugby (MLR) in North America launched two years ago, however, is an important development in bridging the gap between tier-one and tier-two nations and for the development of players in Canada and the United States, he said.
It was a big reality check when I came to Canada just how difficult it was to get the players together.
"They all held down day jobs," said Jones.
But I think the MLR is a lifeline for Canada and the United States.
It's a pathway for players and coaches.
Jones said there were 51 Canadians contracted to MLR clubs last season.
Less than 18 months ago, more than 40 were working other jobs.
"That's a big step in the right direction," he said.
MLR still has a way to go.
It's still in its infancy but it is certainly a pathway into the top levels.
In the long term I'm sure it will get up to speed and be a good competitive competition, so that is critical.

Giriraj Singh Says Rising Population Like Second Stage Cancer
Giriraj Singh said those opposed to population control bring religion into the debate (File)
Union Minister Giriraj Singh on Friday likened India's burgeoning population to "second stage cancer" and called for a stringent legislation to control it, saying that if not controlled then it will go into the fourth stage and become incurable.
Speaking at a seminar on population control, Mr Singh, a hardline leader of the BJP, said it is necessary to enact a stringent law and those who breach it should face punishments like revocation of their voting rights and economic curbs irrespective of their religions.
He said those opposed to measures for controlling population bring religion into the debate.
"Rising population has become like a second stage cancer.
It not controlled, this ailment will go into the fourth stage and become incurable," Mr Singh said.
Like China, India should bring a stringent law, he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech had advocated measures to control population while expressing concern over its "explosive growth."
Keeping one's family is also an act of patriotism, he had added.
Mr Singh said a people's movement is needed to push for a legislation on population control, adding that he will undertake such a yatra, which will be held from Meerut to Delhi, during October 11-13.
House blocks Trump national emergency over border, setting up veto
President Donald Trump speaks while participating in a tour of border wall prototypes.
The House voted Friday to block the national emergency declaration President Donald Trump is using to fund his proposed border wall.
The Democratic-held chamber passed a resolution to terminate Trump's action by a 236-174 margin, sending it to the president.
Eleven Republicans and one independent supported it.
The Senate already approved the measure in a 54-41 vote, as 11 Republicans joined Democrats in backing it.
Trump will likely veto the resolution, the sixth time he will have blocked congressional legislation as president.
He already vetoed a measure to end the emergency declaration in March.
Neither chamber of Congress appears to have the two-thirds majority needed to override the president's opposition.
Failing to get the funding he desired for borders on the southern border from both the Mexican government and Congress, Trump declared the national emergency in February.
His administration plans to pull $3.6 billion from military construction to fund border projects.
Democrats have accused Trump of both circumventing Congress' power of the purse and raiding key Defense funds for unnecessary barriers.
A handful of Republicans in both the House and Senate also had concerns about the precedent Trump's declaration would set for executive overreach in the future.
Some Senate Republicans facing elections next year have faced sharp political pressure over the national emergency vote.
Babies exposed to air pollution have greater risk of death
Babies living in areas with high levels of air pollution have a greater risk of death than those surrounded by cleaner air, a study has found.
It is not the first study to investigate the link between air pollution and infant mortality , but the study drew particular focus on different pollutants and its analysis at different points in babies' lives.
Dr Sarah Kotecha , a researcher at Cardiff University, said the results were difficult for pregnant women and their families to do much about.
"You live where you live and you can't avoid pollution day in day out," she said, adding that it was down to policymakers to reduce pollution levels and for researchers to unpick how pollutants affect health.
"If you can find out some of the mechanisms you can look at potential interventions," she added.
A growing body of research has revealed links between different components of air pollution and health issues, including lung problems, heart disease, mental health problems, dementia and low birthweight.
The latest study, yet to be peer-reviewed or published, will be presented at the European Respiratory Society international congress in Madrid.
Kotecha said the research was based on data for almost 8 million live births in England and Wales between 2001 and 2012.
The team divided England and Wales into 35,000 areas, each containing approximately 1,500 residents, and looked at the annual death rates for babies up to one-year-old, together with the average annual levels for three pollutants.
These were particulate matter known as PM10, which comes from sources including vehicles and waste incineration, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2), which is released through burning of fossil fuels in power stations and refineries as well as metal extraction.
For each pollutant the team compared the death rate for babies in the worst fifth of polluted areas with those in the best fifth.
Once factors such as maternal age, deprivation level for the area and birthweight were taken into account, the team said that babies aged up to one year had a greater chance of dying living in areas with the worst air pollution compared with areas with the cleanest air.
The results held across all three pollutants, with the odds of death 7% worse for NO2, 4% worse for PM10 and 19% worse for SO2.
Further analysis suggested that of the three pollutants, only SO2 was associated with deaths within a baby's first 28 days.
The study was unable to prove whether high levels of air pollution were to blame for the increased risk of death in those areas.
It also did not take into account levels of indoor air pollution.
Prof Mireille Toledano, an expert in population child health at Imperial College London, said the study confirmed that air pollution is a major public health hazard, adding that current standards are failing to protect people.
She said the latest study had a number of limitations.
It looked at average pollution levels over relatively large areas while in reality levels can vary greatly over a small distance - meaning the babies' true exposure was not captured.
The study also did not take into account fluctuations in air pollution with the weather or over seasons, and did not take into account where the mother spent her pregnancy or factors such as maternal smoking.
Toledano said it was also unclear how factors like birthweight were accounted for.
"It is showing there is some kind of additional risk from air pollution for infant death but the way that it has been set up is quite a crude analysis," said Toledano.
Dr Penny Woods, the chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said action must be taken to tackle the public health crisis of air pollution - including introducing clean air zones in the most polluted cities.
"The evidence linking infant mortality and air pollution is still emerging but Dr Kotecha's study, which suggests babies born in the UK's most polluted areas see a significantly increased risk of death, should be a wake-up call to government," she said.
A second study found that exposure to PM10 from traffic during pregnancy and children's early life was linked to a slightly lower lung function of the children at eight years old - although the effect was no longer seen by the time the children were 15.
Woods said the study mirrored previous findings, adding that children cannot protect their own lungs.
"Both these studies concentrate on the damage done by air pollution to some of the most vulnerable members of our society - the very young," she said.
EU & Japan strike "connectivity" deal to link Asia & to counter China's new Silk Road - RT Business News
The European Union has included Japan in its Asia "connectivity" plan, signing a landmark deal to coordinate transport, energy and digital projects amid concerns over China's dominance in infrastructure funding.
The agreement formally seals Japan's engagement in the new EU-Asia connectivity plan and was signed by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the Europa Connectivity Forum in Brussels on Friday.
"Whether it be a single road or a single port, when the EU and Japan undertake something, we are able to build sustainable, rules-based connectivity from the Indo-Pacific to the Western Balkans and Africa," Abe told reporters ahead of the signing ceremony.
EU officials have turned to Japan in an apparent move to evade attracting Chinese financing, fearing what they see as China's dominance in infrastructure building across Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia.
Since 2013, China funded the construction of bridges, roads and tunnels across more than 60 countries under its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, which aims to build a network of land and sea links with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
"The sea route that leads to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic must be open," Abe said, emphasizing the deal's signatories" aim to prevent China-financed projects from dominating EU-Asia transport links.
"Japan and the EU endeavor to ensure synergies and complementarity between their respective cooperation on connectivity and quality infrastructure with partner third countries and coordinate action, notably in the regions of the Western Balkans, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Indo-Pacific, as well as in Africa," the bilateral document states.
The deal is also to ensure "transparent procurement practices," as well as "free, open, fair, non-discriminatory and predictable regional and international trade and investment."
It will be backed by a €60 billion ($65.48 billion) EU guarantee fund, development banks and private investors.
The signatories promised to pay "utmost attention" to the sides" "fiscal capacity and debt-sustainability."
Jean-Claude Juncker promised to help build infrastructure "without mountains of debt" or a reliance "on a single country."
Although not all the money distributed under the deal will be spent in Asia, the EU's new agenda makes spending on infrastructure links with Asia official EU policy, which also involves the bloc's common budget.
The two-day Europa Connectivity Forum is a multi-nation convention which aims to enforce ties between governments, financial institutions and private sectors, across Europe and beyond.
This year's Forum, held under the theme "EU-Asia Connectivity: Building Bridges for a Sustainable Future," is focused on strengthening cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region.
Muslim Woman Says Company Didn't Hire Her As She Wanted To Pray At Work
Shahin Indorewala is suing the firm, claiming that she was discriminated against.
Shahin Indorewala had a job working with children with autism, but she wanted to gain more experience in marketing.
So she applied to Fast Trak Management, a small company that bills itself as "the number 1 marketing firm in the Northern Virginia Area."
Now, Indorewala is suing the company, claiming that she was discriminated against because of her religion when she asked to use break time to pray.
In a lawsuit filed in US District Court on Tuesday, Indorewala said she was "humiliated" by Fast Trak's CEO mocking her Muslim beliefs.
The CEO, Ramses Gavilondo, disputes her version of events, saying Indorewala decided she did not want the job.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations, which brought the lawsuit on Indorewala's behalf, held a brief news conference outside Fast Trak's Falls Church office on Wednesday, when CAIR labeled Fast Trak "a company that disregarded federal law and chose not to hire her because of her faith."
In a video of the news conference, Indorewala said that her first interview went well, and that she was asked to return for a second interview.
At that interview, Indorewala said, an assistant manager at Fast Trak told her that the company offers a long lunch break.
Indorewala asked if she could take a shorter lunch break, so she could take two five-minute breaks during the workday to pray.
She promptly ended the interview.
She said, 'That's not going to work.
We have fixed hours here,' " Indorewala said.
According to the lawsuit, the assistant manager then allegedly walked with Indorewala to Gavilondo, and said that the job's hours wouldn't work for Indorewala.
Indorewala said she then explained to Gavilondo that she prays five times a day.
At that point, Indorewala says, Gavilondo pointed to her headscarf and made mocking comments about religion.
"Am I really being made fun of for my religion in public in what's supposed to be a professional workplace? . . .
Clearly I was being discriminated against because of my religion," Indorewala said at the news conference.
That was it.
I just kind of quietly left the office.
I didn't want to create a scene or anything, but I was pretty hurt and pretty embarrassed.
Reached by phone on Thursday, Gavilondo said he didn't reject Indorewala's application; instead, he said, she was the one who decided she did not want the job.
Someone came for an interview.
They didn't want to work here. . . .
"It's like me going to a store to buy Kit-Kats, and then I don't want to eat the Kit-Kats," he said.
He said he recalled that Indorewala brought up her Muslim faith, but he did not specifically recall her request for five-minute prayer breaks during the day.
And he said he had not made fun of her hijab: "I'm not a fashion expert.
People can wear whatever they want."
Oil prices head for weekly loss as supply fears wane
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Friday but were heading for a weekly loss on a faster-than-expected recovery in Saudi output, while investors also worried about global crude demand amid slowing Chinese economic growth.
During a volatile session, Brent crude LCOc1 futures lost 32 cents to $62.42 a barrel by 11:21 a.m.
EDT (1521 GMT), after dropping to a session low of $60.76 a barrel.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 3 cents to $56.44 a barrel, after falling to $54.75 a barrel.
Brent was on track to fall nearly 3% for the week, its biggest weekly loss since early August, while WTI was set to fall 2.8%.
Earlier in the session, futures fell after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the United States offered to remove all sanctions on Iran in exchange for talks.
However, prices pared losses after U.S. President Donald Trump then said he had refused the request by Tehran.
"We've really been following headline to headline," said Phil Flynn, an analyst with Price Futures Group in Chicago.
Crude futures were also earlier hit by a Wall Street Journal report citing unnamed sources saying that Saudi Arabia had agreed a partial ceasefire in Yemen, said analysts in the Reuters Global Oil Forum.
Brent is just above its level before attacks on Saudi facilities on Sept. 14, which initially halved the kingdom's production.
Sources told Reuters this week that Saudi Arabia had restored capacity to 11.3 million barrels per day.
Saudi Aramco has yet to confirm it is fully back online.
"The risk premium is deflating further," said Saxo Bank's Ole Hansen.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) said it might cut its estimates for global oil demand for 2019 and 2020 should the global economy weaken further.
Key oil freight rates from the Middle East to Asia rocketed as much as 28% on Friday in the global oil shipping market, spooked by U.S. sanctions on units of China's COSCO for alleged involvement in ferrying crude out of Iran.
The COSCO vessels account for about 7.5% of the world's fleet of supertankers, Refinitiv data showed.
Emerging details connected to the impeachment inquiry into Trump also helped to dent demand sentiment, analysts said.
"An impeachment would add to the uncertainty of the U.S. economy," Flynn said.
Brexit news: Reckless stuns BBC QT with brilliant point on Remainers' bid to halt EU exit
The Member of the National Assembly for South Wales East made the point during Thursday's broadcast from Cardiff.
His argument was made in response to whether the tide of opposition would be the same if the referendum had gone in favour of Remain.
He said: "In a democracy, where laws are made and properly interpreted of course, we should obey the law.
The problem we now have is that people voted to leave the EU were told they were being given the decision, and the Government would implement what they decided.
But, Brexit is being blocked by people who don't like Brexit, by people voted Remain and think their views are greater than the majority who voted to leave.
We're seeing in parliament the procedures of the House of Commons abused.
We have had someone in the chair who has allowed his own personal preference for remain to influence how he assesses and frankly breaks the standing orders.
Fiona Bruce interrupted Mr Reckless and said: "John Bercow has always said he doesn't have a preference."
To this the audience burst into laughter with Mr Reckless laughing with them.
He replied: "If you believed that you'd believe anything."
He says the referendum was misguided and therefore he's pleased that the powers are being pushed back to parliament because the 52 percent shouldn't be able to enjoy 100 percent of their victory.
He thinks parliament should ensure we stay in the customs union and the EEA.
Now, would he be saying this if it was the other way around?
Would he be saying we should leave the EU and join the EEA to counter that 48 percent?
No, of course he wouldn't.
He said that election was just a snapchat of public opinion.
To this the crowd burst into applause and cheered Mr Reckless.
Ms Bruce attempted to shout over the audience to correct Mr Reckless, she said: "He didn't sit as one of the eleven judges though Mark."
The former Conservative Party MP countered Ms Bruce's comments and went into detail on Lord Sumption having sat as one of the judges on Gina Miller's previous case.
He said: "That was the case where he dismissed the tried and tested rules of statutory interoperation."
Ms Miller is the businesswoman and campaigner who filed one of two appeals against the English high court's decision that the prorogation was "purely political" and not a matter for the courts.
She was consequently successful in her appeal, along with the previous victory during an appeal when the Supreme Court ruled in favour of giving MPs a say over triggering Article 50 in 2017.
Kylie Jenner tweets she's 'really sick' and can't make Paris Fashion Week
Reality television star, makeup mogul and self-made billionaire Kylie Jenner is sick and won't be in Paris for Friday's Balmain runway show and debut of her cosmetics collaboration with the French fashion house's creative director Olivier Rousteing, she announced on Twitter on Wednesday morning.
"Unfortunately I'm really sick and unable to travel," read the post in part, "I'm heartbroken to be missing this show, but I know that my amazing team, and my friends who are in town for the event, will help me be there in spirit. ..."
She ended by urging her social media followers to join her in watching the women's spring and summer 2020 Paris Fashion Week runway show, which is set to be livestreamed on the Balmain website at 2:30 a.m.
As part of the collaboration, she had been tapped to serve as the show's artistic director for makeup.
According to published reports, the 22-year-old Jenner was also scheduled to celebrate the collaboration with an event at the label's Rue Saint-Honoré boutique.
Jenner also was scheduled to be a presenter with Kim Kardashian West and Kendall Jenner at Sunday's 71st Primetime Emmy Awards.
However, she was a no-show.
Several news outlets have reported that Jenner's illness was severe enough for her to be hospitalized.
However, The Times has not been able to independently corroborate this information.
An email to Jenner's management team inquiring about the extent and source of the young star's illness went unanswered Thursday.
The Kylie X Balmain cosmetics collaboration, which will be officially unveiled at the show, includes eyeshadow, lip liner and lip gloss and is set to go on sale at 8 a.m. Friday on Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics website.
Kamala Harris Calls For Probe Into State Dept. Officials Working With Giuliani
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) on Thursday asked the inspector general of the State Department to investigate whether its officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, worked with Rudy Giuliani on any "partisan political activities."
Harris' written request to Inspector General Steve Linick comes as President Donald Trump is under intense legal scrutiny for pressuring the president of Ukraine to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival he may face in the 2020 presidential election.
Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, was part of the effort to influence Ukrainian officials, according to a summary of a conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president, and a related whistleblower complaint.
"To help ensure that the foreign relations of the United States are carried out in good faith, I request that you investigate these and other circumstances described in the complaint and preserve all relevant records," Harris, another 2020 presidential contender, wrote.
"I am particularly concerned that Department officials might have been aware of or aided Mr. Giuliani in violation of law or regulations against engaging in partisan political activities," she continued, urging Linick to determine whether Pompeo or any officials under him enabled Giuliani to advance Trump's political agenda.
Her concerns are rooted in details from the whistleblower's report, which states that multiple U.S. officials were aware of Trump's actions, including two ambassadors who spoke directly with Giuliani about the president's request.
Civility in Politics: New awards scheme set up to counter Westminster division and recognise politicians who show courtesy
A new awards scheme has been set up to recognise politicians who show courtesy in their work.
It comes after a divisive week in Westminster following the return of Parliament.
It was marked by threats against MPs and outrage over the language used by the likes of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
To counter the division, the "Civility in Politics" awards were announced on Friday, with the politician of the year to be awarded £3,000 to give to charity.
Boris Johnson has been criticised for the tone of language he has used in the Commons chamber.
Lord Stewart, announcing the awards, said: "Everyone agrees that politics in the UK is facing a crisis of trust and a crisis of civility.
As divisions and bitterness mount in the continuing debates around Brexit, we strongly believe that politics has to respond not by mirroring these trends, but by bucking them.
These awards are a small attempt by a group of people in public life - of different and no political persuasions - to shine a spotlight on politicians who argue their case with decency and civility, and are able to engage and work with people across the divides that affect us all."
Nominations will open on Saturday, with an award ceremony in March next year.
In an exclusive interview with the Standard, former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd today accused Mr Johnson of deploying aggressive language that "does incite violence."
Mr Johnson, for his part, said he "deplores" threats made against MPs.
Jess Phillips 'frightened' after receiving 'be afraid' death threats
On Thursday, Labour MP Jess Phillips - another one of those to have criticised Mr Johnson - said a man was arrested after trying to "kick the door" of her constituency office while reportedly shouting that she was a "fascist."
And in a viral Twitter thread, Ellie Cooper, the daughter of senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper, described her fears for her mother in the wake of Ms Cox's murder .
Scott Morrison will consider Donald Trump's formula, but it's unlikely he'll follow it
And Morrison does not have to say "fake news" to echo the President at times.
He complained about the media on Wednesday for running "completely false" and "completely misleading" accounts of his climate policies.
So when Morrison needs answers on how to win the next election, he will no doubt consider Trump's formula - and whether it works in November 2020.
But political tactics do not transfer so easily across the Pacific.
Those around Morrison are not planning a Trumpification of the Prime Minister for the simple reason that the intensely partisan tactics that work in the United States cannot work in a world where elections are won and lost in the centre.
Compulsory voting stays the hand of anyone who wants to appeal to the edge and forget the middle.
Trump is divisive in Australia and his friendship with Morrison may alienate some Australian voters, which means copying the President is no guarantee of victory.
Some of Morrison's critics on the left see a world they fear, or perhaps secretly the almighty battle they want, when they make the Prime Minister out to be like Trump.
Imagine Morrison if that were so.
He would not only skip the United Nations climate summit.
He would ridicule it as a waste of time.
The fact that Morrison used his speech to the UN to talk about action on climate shows he does not want to lose voters in the middle who expect their political leaders to take it seriously.
And there is a gulf between the two leaders on the right of a superpower to dictate terms in the world.
"The future does not belong to globalists.
The future belongs to patriots," Trump said at the United Nations on Tuesday.
The fact that Morrison used his speech to the UN to talk about action on climate shows he does not want to lose voters in the middle.
What that means may require long study, but it is an immediate contrast with the Australian support for negotiated settlements between countries rather than the will of one group of patriots imposed on others.
"We will be more secure and prosperous in a global order based on agreed rules, not one based on the exercise of power alone," Morrison told Asialink in Sydney in June.
Zimbabwe: Sanctions Slow Down Zim Progress
Zvamaida Murwira in NEW YORK, United States
Illegal and ruinous sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by the West have markedly slowed down the country's development, President Mnangagwa has said.
He further dismissed the embargo as an attack on the rights of citizens.
The President said this here during his address to the 74th Ordinary Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 74).
He applauded Southern Africa for solidly standing by Zimbabwe in calling for the unconditional removal of the two-decades-old embargo.
While Zimbabwe had registered significant progress in providing safety nets for vulnerable groups of society, the President said, more could have been achieved had it not been for the illegal sanctions.
These achievements are in spite of the continued albatross of the illegal economic sanctions.
"Furthermore, sanctions are slowing down our progress, inhibiting our economic recovery and punishing the poorest and most vulnerable," he said.
The President said Zimbabwe was in a transition and was determined to overcome the reality that it had a collapsed economy and currency due to illegal sanctions.
Namibian President Hage Geingob weighed in, calling for the unequivocal lifting of sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe so that Harare could pursue its economic development agenda.
President Mnangagwa urged the United Nations (UN) to assert its authority and honour its principles by reining in countries that imposed the sanctions.
As the United Nations, let us boldly honour the principles of our Charter.
The wrongs of the world must be set right.
Unfair practices must be challenged; injustice, racism and all forms of oppression of man by man must be opposed and rejected.
"My country applauds the South African Development Community, the African Union and all those who stand with us in demanding the immediate and unconditional removal of these illegal sanctions," said President Mnangagwa.
Those that imposed these illegal sanctions must heed this call and lift them now.
Cooperation is a win-win game.
Sanctions are a lose-lose game.
Zimbabwe deserves a restart.
The West, specifically the US and the European Union (EU), imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe at the turn of the millennium in protest over the irreversible land reform programme that sought to correct land ownership imbalances that had been inherited from the racist colonial regime.
Both the US and the EU claim to be champions of democracy and human rights, yet they are stifling economic growth in Zimbabwe through the maintenance of the racist sanctions.
Analysts have suggested that the West was using the sanctions as a ploy to effect regime change through making living standards difficult in Zimbabwe so that citizens turn against their Government.
The 39th SADC Summit of Heads of State and Government held in Tanzania noted the adverse impact on Zimbabwe's economy and the region at large, of the prolonged economic sanctions, and expressed solidarity.
SADC called for the immediate lifting of the sanctions to facilitate socio-economic recovery in the country, and declared October 25th as the date on which SADC member States can collectively voice their disapproval of the sanctions through various activities and platforms until the sanctions are lifted.
PM Narendra Modi At UN, Says "Have Anger, Commitment Against Terrorism"
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing the UN General Assembly today, stressed that the international community needs to unite against terror and work on consensus on fighting terrorism, which, he said, is among the biggest challenges not for any single country but for the entire world.
"For the sake of humanity, the world has to unite against terror," PM Modi said in his address.
Without naming Pakistan, PM Modi said there needed to be more anger globally about what terrorism was doing to humanity.
We belong to a country that has given the world Buddh (Buddha's message of peace), not 'Yuddh' (war).
When we raise our voice against terror, it is with seriousness and anger," said the Prime Minister in a 20-minute speech in Hindi, in which he also spoke about India's fight against global warming and its development initiatives.
This was his second address to the General Debate at the UN, five years after his maiden speech as Prime Minister in 2014.
"The lack of unanimity amongst us on the issue of terrorism dents those very principles that are the basis for the creation of the UN," PM Modi remarked.
Swami Vivekananada had given the message of harmony and peace to the Parliament of Religions, and not dissension.
The world's biggest democracy still has the same message for the world -- harmony and peace," he said.
During his week-long US visit, the Prime Minister has, without once making a direct reference to Pakistan, made it clear that the country is the epicenter of terror and needs to act against terrorists operating from its soil.
At the mega "Howdy, Modi!" event last Sunday, sharing a stage with US President Donald Trump, the Prime Minister said: "They have made hatred towards India the centre of their agenda."
On Thursday, the US said any easing of tensions between India and Pakistan is contingent on Islamabad taking action against those who engaged in cross-border infiltration.
"I think what we would like to see are the conditions whereby India and Pakistan can have a constructive conversation that leads to an improvement of relations between the two nuclear powers," said Alice Wells, US Acting Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia.
And obviously, that is going to hinge off of counterterrorism, off of Pakistan's seriousness of effort in ensuring that groups don't take advantage and engage in cross-border infiltration, that there are serious steps to implement the Financial Action Task Force action plan that Pakistan has committed to, and which includes the prosecution of UN-designated terrorists.
"So whether it's Hafiz Saeed who currently is in custody and under prosecution, but also leaders of Jaish-e-Mohammed, like Masood Azhar, who long have been able to exploit their presence on Pakistani soil," she said.
Japan sees North Korea missile, China space activity as threat
Japan has raised its caution level about North Korea's missile capability, saying in a defense report that the country resumed missile tests while taking no concrete denuclearization steps and had succeeded in making miniaturized warheads.
The annual defense paper, approved Friday by the Cabinet, underscores Japan's fear of being targeted by its neighbor.
Its reaction to the North's recent tests contrasts to the low-key U.S. response.
Since the second U.S.-North Korea summit collapsed this year, North Korea has fired 10 short-range missiles and projectiles deemed new and upgraded.
The defense paper also highlights that China's threat is expanding into space from the regional seas.
Japan is also bolstering its defense role under its alliance with the U.S. and is launching a space unit and measures against cyber and electromagnetic attacks.
Brexit news: Britain on brink of 'watershed moment' as Remainers to accept 'they are wrong'
Caller Bob insisted MPs seeking to oppose Brexit in Parliament will soon realise they are in the "wrong" position.
Members of Parliament have been engaged in a bitter battle with Boris Johnson and his Cabinet in an attempt to make sure Britain does not leave the European Union without an official agreement.
Phoning in Mike Graham's show on talkRADIO, Bob said: "I think it's a watershed moment because the Brexit blockers in Parliament are beginning to show their true colours."
It's not that they want a deal for Brexit, they just don't want Brexit.
They're getting more and more outspoken and frustrated because they are beginning to realise they are fundamentally wrong.
Bob continued: "The reason for that, the fundamental reason for that, is that they are defying the people of this country who are sovereign."
It all goes back to one fundamental thing, this wonderful thing that we have in this country - that is our Constitution.
A lot of people say we don't have a Constitution, well, we do.
Boris Johnson on Thursday refused to apologise for describing attempts to block a no-deal break with the EU as the "surrender act."
But the Prime Minister acknowledged that he would have to be able to "reach out" to opposition MPs if he was to secure their support for any new deal he negotiated with the EU.
Speaking to BBC South, Mr Johnson said: "I need to reach out across the House of Commons."
Mr Barnier told reporters: "We are still ready to work on any new legal and operational proposal from the EU."
Following a fiery debate in the Commons, Speaker of the House John Bercow urged MPs to give up negative conduct.
Mr Bercow said: "I think there's a widespread sense across the House and beyond that yesterday the House did itself no credit."
There was an atmosphere in the chamber worse than any I've known in my 22 years in the House.
On both sides passions were inflamed, angry words uttered, the culture was toxic.
6 Self-Help Books That -- Really! -- Help
"Mom & Me & Mom" By Maya Angelou
The memoir can teach anybody to forgive, let go of a tough past and get along with a hell-on-wheels parent (and we mean anybody.)
Maya Angelou's moving, honest portrait of her up and down relationship with Vivian Baxter -- the bold, smart, hard-drinking, pistol-toting woman who left Angelou with her grandmother for most of her childhood but reunited with her during her daughter's adolescence -- is full of wisdom, laughs and blockbuster sentences like, "there are times when no one is right and sometimes among family and children, no one can admit that there is no right, and that maybe at the same time there is no wrong," and, "She liberated me from a society that would have had me think of myself as the lower of the low.
She liberated me to life." -- Leigh Newman
GM Reverses Course On Decision To Cut Off Health Care For Striking Workers
General Motors has decided to fund health care benefits for thousands of striking workers after the company initially moved to cut them off early in the nationwide work stoppage.
The automaker said in a statement Thursday that it was "very concerned about the significant confusion" surrounding employee health insurance and that it had "chosen to work with our providers to keep all benefits fully in place" for workers on strike.
The company assured there would be "no disruption" to medical, dental and prescription drug coverage.
The move amounts to an about-face by Detroit-based GM, which said last week that the United Auto Workers union would have to fund COBRA benefits until the work stoppage ended.
That earlier decision by GM ― which turned into national news ― created a wave of anxiety among employees who feared a lapse in coverage.
Labor leaders and politicians hammered the company for what appeared to be a hardball bargaining tactic two days into the strike.
The UAW did not let up its criticism even after GM reversed course Thursday.
The union's lead negotiator on the GM contract, Vice President Terry Dittes, sent a letter to the company accusing it of "toying with the lives of hundreds of thousands of our UAW families."
"There is no doubt that public sentiment sees these actions of GM as a shameful act!"
The company declined to say how long it intended to fund the health care benefits if the strike continues for weeks.
The stoppage had entered its 11th day on Thursday, with no clear end in sight.
It is possible if the strike persists the company could decide again to force the union to pay for benefits out of its strike fund.
Dittes said Wednesday that the UAW was waiting on a response from GM on the union's latest proposals and that "the back and forth will continue" until everything is resolved.
The union and the company had been far apart on key issues, including the wage scale for newer hires, the company's use of temporary workers, and the share of health care costs borne by employees.
The strike involves nearly 50,000 workers at more than 50 GM facilities around the country.
The UAW is also negotiating new contracts this year with Ford and Fiat Chrysler, the other members of the Big Three.
The union chose to bargain first with GM, extending its previous contracts with the other two automakers.
UAW leadership called for a strike at GM starting Sept. 16 after workers" contract there expired.
As HuffPost reported in July, the negotiations for a new four-year contract were expected to be the most difficult in more than a decade.
Workers are expecting to make significant gains after sacrificing to prop up the company around the time of the financial crisis.
GM, meanwhile, wants to keep labor costs down as auto sales slow.
As one GM worker previously told HuffPost, "It's time for them to give back."

Saudi FM: Financial pressure is best way to control Iran
Saudi Arabia called on the world to apply "utmost pressure with every tool available" to end Iran's aggressive conduct, saying Thursday that the most effective way to control Tehran is to cut off its financial resources.
Saudi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf again blamed Iran for the Sept. 14 missile and drone attack on Saudi oil facilities, which jolted global oil prices and temporarily knocked out nearly 6% of daily global crude production.
"We know very well who stood behind this aggression," Al-Assaf told the U.N. General Assembly.
He called the strikes a flagrant violation of international laws and a threat to international peace and security.
We have known that regime for 40 years.
It is good at nothing but masterminding explosions, destruction and assassinations, not only in our region but also throughout the world," Al-Assaf said.
Utmost pressure with every tool available should be applied to end the terrorist and aggressive conduct of the Iranian regime.
Saudi Arabia insists Iranian weapons were used and has invited U.N. investigators to assess where the strikes were launched.
The United States, France, Britain and Germany also blame Iran, which has been under U.S. sanctions since 2018.
Iran has repeatedly and vehemently denied any involvement, and its president, Hassan Rouhani, says the Tehran government will not talk until the sanctions are lifted.
"Cease this policy of maximum pressure and pursue a policy of dialogue and logic and reason," he stressed at a news conference on the sidelines of the General Assembly on Thursday.
U.S. President Donald Trump has deferred, at least for now, any immediate military strike on Iran.
But he approved a broader effort to beef up security in Saudi Arabia and the region.
He told reporters that showing restraint "shows far more strength" than launching retaliatory strikes now.
The U.S. said Thursday it was sending one Patriot missile battery and four ground-based radar systems to Saudi Arabia, in what officials describe as the first steps to help the kingdom protect itself against Iranian attacks.
Two more Patriot batteries and a THAAD missile defense system will be prepared to go later if needed, and the deployment will involve about 200 troops.
Said al-Assaf: "It is necessary for the international community to realize that cutting off sources of finance is the best way to compel the regime to renounce its militias, prevent it from developing ballistic missiles and put an end to its destabilizing activities in the region and the world."
He added: "We are dealing with a rogue and terrorist system that continues to threaten international peace and security.
It also jeopardizes energy supplies and the world economy; hence, the recent attacks are a real test of the international community's will.
Tensions between Iran and the West have risen since Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with several world powers, saying the agreement was woefully inadequate.
The U.S. went on to impose heavy sanctions on Iran, even as other nations that signed the nuclear accord argued for trying to salvage it.
After continuing to comply with the agreement for a year, Iran has returned to expanding its nuclear enrichment program.
Trump Attacks Whistleblower Sources, Suggests Complaint Is Treason: Reports
President Donald Trump on Thursday attacked anyone involved in the whistleblower complaint regarding his dealings with Ukraine as "almost a spy" and suggested their actions to expose his alleged impropriety were "treason," reported The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times.
The president made the remark as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the complaint, which prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday to announce the opening of an impeachment inquiry into Trump.
The whistleblower, an unnamed U.S. intelligence officer, alleges several White House officials accused Trump of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
Biden is a front-runner in the Democratic race to challenge Trump's reelection in 2020.
The White House then attempted to cover up the exchange, according to the complaint.
The Los Angeles Times posted audio of Trump's spy remarks he reportedly made in front of a crowd of staff from the United States Mission to the United Nations in New York City.
"Basically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call, and he never saw the call - heard something and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is - they're almost a spy," Trump said.
"Who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information?
Because that's close to a spy," the president continued.
You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right?
We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.
No one in the U.S. has been convicted of treason ― a crime punishable by death ― in the last 70 years, according to NBC News.
The House Intelligence Committee released the declassified complaint Thursday ahead of Maguire's hearing.
The complainant alleges Trump's call with Zelensky amounted to an "abuse of his office for personal gain" and that White House officials were directed by White House lawyers to store a transcript of the call in an electronic system used to handle classified information.
Maguire, whom Trump appointed to head the U.S. intelligence community last month, testified Thursday that he believed the whistleblower had "acted in good faith" when filing the complaint.
"I have every reason to believe they have done everything by the book and followed the law," he told the committee.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) condemned Trump's attacks on the whistleblower and his or her sources.
"The President's suggestion that those involved in the whistleblower complaint should be dealt with as "we used to do" for "spies and treason" is a reprehensible invitation to violence against witnesses in our investigation," Schiff tweeted.
All Americans must denounce such witness intimidation.
Fife Flyers expect toughest test yet in Belfast Giants double-header
Fife Flyers will face their toughest test of the season to date when they take on Belfast Giants in a Challenge Cup double-header this weekend.
That's according to head coach Todd Dutiaume who wants his team to rise to the challenge against last season's Elite League champions, with a ferry trip to the Northern Irish capital on Saturday followed by the return match at Fife Ice Arena on Sunday.
"From what we've seen on tape, Belfast are an incredibly deep, well-rounded, physical and hard-working side," Dutes said.
I imagine that will be our toughest challenge to date as a group, and we want to respond well to it.
With a win and a defeat each, Flyers and Belfast both have two points after two games in Challenge Cup Group B.
The weekend results could go a long way towards claiming a top three finish, and a quarter-final place.
The Kirkcaldy side will need to find a way past former netminder Shane Owen, who moved to Belfast in the summer after an impressive season between the pipes in Fife.
"We have a tremendous amount of respect not only for Shane but all our former players," Dutiaume said.
He was recruited by an opposition team for a reason, and he seems to have settled in well there.
I'm sure we'll have an opportunity to shake hands with him after the game, but up until that point it has to be business as usual.
Instead of focusing on who we know or don't know, we have to be prepared to go into battle with these guys and grind out two crucial wins in the Challenge Cup.
While the cup takes focus this weekend, Flyers have enjoyed a positive start to their league campaign, sitting top of the standings despite a 4-2 defeat in Guildford on Sunday that saw the team endure a 24-hour round bus trip.
Depsite their early success, Dutiaume believes there is still room for improvement.
"We've had a great start to the season, but we'd still like to be better at retrieving the puck, defensively, in all three areas of the ice," he explained.
That's a work in progress.
For instance, in the Nottingham game, all six players played a significant part in not only retaining possession but also getting it back when there was a turnover.
It's a commitment to stick with the plan, and work hard in all aspects of the game.
If the puck goes in people are fast to blame the goaltender or defencemen, but these are the last lines of defence.
You need all guys on the ice, at all times, buying into playing on both sides of the puck and this is going to be key to our success.
Sitting top of the standings is a good place to be, but if as a group we rest on that then we're all not doing our jobs.
We have to fight for the right to stay up around top of the table, and it takes a commitment every night.
Dutiaume also stressed the importance of keeping five men on the ice after taking nine minor penalties in Guildford on Sunday.
"We ran into early penalty trouble and that's a big momentum swinger," he said.
We need to stay out of the box consistently because when you're on the back foot killing for big portions at the start of a hockey game, regardless if it's evened up later, you can lose that momentum quickly and it's hard to gain it back.
All teams will talk about having a great start and making sure they take early steps to get a psychological and physical advantage.
Dutiaume is also hoping his team can become more potent on the powerplay, adding: "Our powerplay is successful when we stick with it and stay patient, rather than trying to force passes because a team is killing great against us, and we end up getting ourselves isolated.
We have an incredibly offensive bunch so the powerplay is not concerning, we just have to get comfortable with the system and make sure we're not standing around."
Nancy Pelosi is subject of book by daughter Christine Pelosi
An upcoming book on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi comes from someone who knows her well, daughter Christine Pelosi.
"The Nancy Pelosi Way" will be released Nov. 26, Skyhorse Publishing announced Thursday.
Christine Pelosi's book will examine how a mother of five became the first female house speaker and her current leadership of House Democrats during the Trump administration.
According to Skyhorse, Christine Pelosi will weave together "the professional and personal experiences" of her mother.
Christine Pelosi is a Democratic Party strategist and author of "Campaign Boot Camp" and "Campaign Boot Camp 2.0."
Pelosi's sister, Alexandra Pelosi, is a filmmaker and journalist who has made several documentaries about contemporary politics.
Taoiseach opens new Irish Consulate in LA
The Taoiseach has opened a new Consulate General of Ireland in Los Angeles.
Leo Varadkar was accompanied by the Mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti at the ceremony.
It is the latest in a series of new foreign diplomatic missions that have been opened as part of "Global Ireland," a government initiative that aims to double Ireland's international presence by 2025.
The Taoiseach is in Los Angeles for a two-day trade mission focused on Ireland's growing television and film industries.
He will meet with senior executives from some of the world's leading streaming companies, studios and networks, including Netflix, Hulu, Skydance and Fox Searchlight.
The Government plans to double the size of the audio-visual sector over the next five years by increasing production activity and doubling the numbers of people employed in the sector to 24,000.
Tucker Carlson Calls Adam Schiff 'Demonstrably Mentally Ill'
Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Thursday called House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff "demonstrably mentally ill" in a rant about those who say "extreme and mindless things" to get on television.
"The prime example is Adam Schiff," the host said on "Tucker Carlson Tonight."
This coming from a guy who called white supremacy a hoax.
Carlson was leading into Schiff's improvised version of President Donald Trump's phone call with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, in which the president repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter as U.S. military aid was temporarily blocked.
Then Carlson, who declared that it's "hard to believe" that Trump's actions are an impeachable offense, ratcheted up his takedown of the California lawmaker.
"He recently went into a kind of trance and delivered his own prophetic version of what he believed must have happened between President Trump and the president of Ukraine," said Carlson, who showed a clip of Thursday's congressional hearing chaired by Schiff.
Keep in mind, that isn't some guy babbling in the men's room at Starbucks.
That is the man who chairs the mighty House Intelligence Committee.
We trust him with the most sensitive information, and yet he is clearly, demonstrably mentally ill.
Barrhead Travel opens up 100 jobs for former Thomas Cook staff
Scots holiday firm Barrhead Travel has thrown a lifeline to scores of Thomas Cook staff who lost their jobs with its recent collapse, by opening up 100 positions across its 34 branded stores.
Thomas Cook - the world's oldest travel firm - folded at the start of this week, prompting the loss of 21,000 jobs worldwide, about 9,000 of them in the UK.
It had more than 600 branches, including about 30 in Scotland.
Barrhead has created positions throughout its UK store network, with new jobs across Scottish cities and towns including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen.
It plans on using a team to travel to meet potential candidates over the coming weeks.
Barrhead said former Thomas Cook employees "will bring a wealth of experience to the Barrhead Travel family and are being actively encouraged to contact the Barrhead Travel recruitment line."
Its "Brilliant Travel" division is also fast-tracking applications for up to 100 additional homeworkers or those looking to start their own independent agency.
Renfrewshire-based Barrhead added that there continues to be growing customer demand for specialist holidays such as adventure travel, weddings and honeymoons, river cruise and luxury.
The majority of positions available are customer-focused in their branches or specialist call centres, but there are vacancies also available in marketing, IT and business development.
Barrhead Travel president Jacqueline Dobson said: "We are very proud of our family ethos at Barrhead Travel and are keen to save jobs where we can and support industry colleagues from Thomas Cook.
Many of us have very fond memories of Thomas Cook - both professionally and personally.
We put a lot of support into developing our people and we believe we offer some of the best staff benefits in the industry."
It's clear that the teams from Thomas Cook are truly passionate about finding their clients" dream holiday and we want to help them get back to doing what they do best as soon as possible."
Thomas Cook ceased trading after failing to secure the extra £200 million needed to keep the business afloat.
Gatwick airport drone shutdown could have been an inside job, police say
Whoever flew the drones that closed Gatwick during the busiest week of the winter "had detailed knowledge of the airport," according to Sussex Police.
But after nine months of investigation, police responsible for the airport say they may never find the culprit.
Between 18 and 20 December, two "unmanned aerial vehicles" closed the world's busiest runway for 33 hours - cancelling 1,000 flights and disrupting the travel plans of 150,000 travellers.
The closure of Gatwick airport cost airlines around £50m in lost revenue and passenger care costs.
The policing operation and subsequent investigation have cost £800,000.
Assistant chief constable Dave Miller, head of operations command, said: "This was a serious and deliberate criminal act designed to endanger airport operations and the safety of the travelling public."
More than 100 "credible witnesses" were interviewed, who were "used to working in a complex airport environment."
They included a pilot, airport workers and airport police.
Their statements indicate the drones were flown in 12 separate bursts across the three days.
The activity ranged from seven to 45 minutes.
"On six of these occasions, witnesses clearly saw two drones operating simultaneously," said Sussex Police.
The report says there was no evidence to indicate the activity was related to terrorism, nor was it state-sponsored.
Earlier this month, a climate-change group called Heathrow Pause attempted to shut down Heathrow airport by flying drones, but in the Gatwick incident, no campaigning group is thought to be responsible.
In April, Chris Woodroofe, chief operating officer at Gatwick, told BBC's Panorama: "It was clear that the drone operators had a link into what was going on at the airport."
Sussex Police say they have identified, researched and ruled out 96 "people of interest."
A couple from Crawley were wrongly arrested in December for the drone attack.
Paul Gait and Elaine Kirk were released without charge.
Mr Miller said: "With support from national experts, we have carried out an exhaustive criminal investigation but, without new information coming to light, there are no further realistic lines of enquiry at this time.
Measures now available have strengthened our capability to respond to and investigate a similar incident in the future."
Biffa fined for trying to ship household waste to China
The waste management firm Biffa has been fined £350,000 for trying to ship household rubbish to China labelled as wastepaper fit for recycling.
Items found in the bales included sanitary towels, nappies, wet wipes and condoms - with the shipping containers reeking of vomit.
A search of seven 25-tonne shipping containers bound for China at Felixstowe port in Suffolk found waste items including plastic containers, plastic bags, scrap metal and electrical debris.
Other items found during the search included laminate flooring, coat hangers, pet food containers, latex gloves and pieces of china.
Environment Agency inspectors also found women's underwear, bags of dog excrement and a 12-inch record by the 90s band Deee-Lite.
Biffa Waste Services, the second largest recycling company in the UK, claimed the bales contained 98.5% waste paper, which can be legally transported to China.
Shipping heavily contaminated waste to the country has been illegal since 2006 because it is not part of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Biffa was convicted of two counts of breaching waste transportation laws between May and June 2015 after a three-week trial at Wood Green crown court in north London in June.
Jurors heard Biffa, which reported revenues of £683.6m last year, used two brokers to manage the deal to send the waste to sites in Shenzhen and Guangdong on the South China Sea coast.
One of the brokers arranged a shipment of 5,863 tonnes of wastepaper between Biffa worth £350,000, while the second arranged the sale of 4,992 tonnes of wastepaper worth £290,000.
However, the Environment Agency prevented any of the seven containers from leaving Felixstowe.
The company claimed its exports were regularly inspected by the Chinese authorities who had never made complaints, and that its clients were capable of generating significant quantities of paper from the bales it supplied.
Handing Biffa a £350,000 fine on Friday, the judge, Simon Auerbach, said: "The principle of this environmental regulation is to the prevent export of our waste processing and disposing of the problem to other parts of the world.
Exporting to non-OECD countries is the very essence of the offence and the willingness of the Chinese authorities to accept it and their ability to process it are not, in my judgment, the point.
Biffa was also ordered to pay £240,000 costs to the Environment Agency and a confiscation order of £9,912, which was the total amount it received for the blocked shipment of waste.
Richard Branwell, defending Biffa, highlighted the shortcomings of the UK's waste management system as a whole, pointing out that of all the 8m tonnes of fibre recovered each year, just 3.3m tonnes can be recycled domestically.
He said Biffa's business model of exporting waste was vital to helping the government meet its recovery and recycling targets.
Sailesh Mehta, prosecuting, said contaminants could be seen poking out of bales that were not broken open by inspectors.
Mehta said Biffa had dismissed suggestions that its waste sorting process could be improved to prevent contaminants ending up in bales of waste paper.
The company had claimed its processes were already "as good as it gets" when ideas such as employing more pickers or slowing conveyor belts were floated.
"If all [these ideas] are impossible, we suggest it is incumbent on the defendant charged with this important duty to start the whole system afresh," he said.
French chemical fire extinguished as questions mount
PARIS (AP) - French authorities and Normandy residents are clearing up residue from a huge fire at a chemical plant as a foul stench continues to spread over a swath of territory.
No one was injured in Thursday's fire at a lubricant plant in Rouen, but residents have expressed concern about possible health risks and consequences for the nearby Seine River.
The head of the regional administration said Friday the fire was extinguished Thursday night after nearly 24 hours.
Firefighters are still on the scene.
The administration warned of a new odor released after the fire was put out, saying it could spread to neighboring regions.
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said people in fragile health should remain indoors through Friday night.
The plant is among the highest-risk industrial sites in Europe.
New units to cater for disabled residents
Ten new apartments will be designed and built for young people with disabilities in Fraser Property Australia's western Sydney development Ed. Square, with one more apartment set aside for an on-site support worker.
The development, located at Edmondson Park near Liverpool, will feature more than 992 apartments and 892 terraces and townhomes with a range of styles and floorplans across six hectares of open land.
The development is to include a 19-storey residential tower and will be completed in the second half of 2020.
Prior to moving in, the apartments will be kitted out with everything disabled people need to meet High Physical Support benchmarks for residential disability housing under the National Disability Insurance Scheme.
The deal, struck between Fraser Property Australia and disability housing provider Summer Housing, increases the range and scale of housing options available for those with disabilities, according to Summer Housing Australia chief executive officer Dan McLennan.
Mr McLennan said the right housing and support in the right location can increase a person's quality of life and independence, while reducing lifetime care costs.
"Summer Housing's delivery model is a contemporary one that brings accessible and affordable housing and support together with smart home technology to give individuals greater choice and control over how they live," he said.
Frasers Property Australia's development director Warwick Dowler said connectivity is an important part of the criteria for housing people with a disability.
You don't have to have a car at Ed. Square as you are already connected to a thriving community and the Edmondson Park train station is on your doorstep," he said.
Everything at Ed. Square will be within minutes.
The town centre will provide a shopping, dining and entertainment precinct incorporating an Eat Street, fresh food marketplace and Coles supermarket, state-of-the-art Event Cinema, childcare centre, water play area, tavern and healthcare facilities.

The schoolgirl was hit by a car in Newcastle at around 6.40pm Wednesday night
Melissa Tate, 10, who was rushed to a local hospital, died of catastrophic injuries
The schoolgirl who died from catastrophic injuries following a suspected hit-and-run in Newcastle has been pictured for the first time.
Melissa Tate, 10, was hit by the car in the Kenton area of the city at about 6.40pm on Wednesday.
Police announced on Thursday that, after being rushed to hospital with devastating injuries, the little girl sadly died.
Two 23-year-old men were arrested, as well as two women in the wake of the smash.
Northumbria Police Chief Inspector Chris Grice said: 'This is understandably a difficult time for the family and it is something that nobody should have to go through.'
Specialist officers have been supporting them since Melissa was involved in the collision on Wednesday night and they continue to do so.
A group leaves flowers at the scene where a girl was hit by a car and later died of her injuries
We will remain with them over the coming days and weeks, and will be on hand to help them in any way we can.
'This incident has had a big impact on the community in Kenton and I know that residents will come together to support Melissa's family.
However, I would ask that people respect their privacy at this time and allow them to grieve as a family.'
Arsenal fans in meltdown over Xhaka becoming captain... but rival supporters think it's hilarious - The Sun
THE NEWS that Granit Xhaka is set to be announced as Arsenal's club captain has been met with agony by many Gooners.
Reports indicate that Unai Emery entrusted the decision to his squad, having originally picked a five-strong group of leaders to rotate the armband.
Xhaka's appointment has divided supporters
And on Friday news broke that Xhaka was to be named the official replacement of Laurent Koscielny, who controversially left Arsenal in the summer.
Many Gunners fans are ready to get behind the Swiss midfielder but others see him as a liability.
The reports happened to pop up on Xhaka's 27th birthday and critics used a club well-wishing post to vent their frustration.
Gooner Zaki wrote: "Announce six month holiday as birthday present."
Another, Yash, added: "Sell him as a gift."
While Ariss remarked: "Xhaka boom Xhaka out of my club."
And Aliwa lamented: "Doesn't deserve to wear the armband, he's a total banter in our team."
One fan accounted however, rebuffed: "These so called Arsenal fans are the worst.
Highly aggressive children who never achieved anything in their life.
Fans of rival teams took aim at Arsenal as well, claiming it was further evidence the North London side had lost their way.
One Spurs fan commented a mock-up of the Jose Mourinho meme reading: "I prefer not to laugh, if I laugh I am in big trouble."
An Everton fan joked: "Just realised I can't laugh at Arsenal for making Xhaka their captain because ours runs off the pitch three times a week and hasn't picked his head up for a cross since 2014."
A Chelsea fan added: "We also don't have a captain at Chelsea, but Xhaka at Arsenal!?"
Toyota said to be increasing stake in Subaru to more than 20%
Toyota Motor plans to raise its stake in Subaru to more than 20% from around 17% now, a deal that would also see the smaller firm invest in Japan's top automaker, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
The deal is due to be approved at a Toyota board meeting on Friday, the people said, declining to be identified because the information has not been made public.
The investment would come a month after Toyota and another smaller Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor, said they would take small equity stakes in each other.
Such tie-ups highlight how automakers are scrambling to chase scale, manage costs and boost development.
Traditional carmakers, especially smaller ones like Subaru and Suzuki, are struggling to meet the fast pace of change in an industry being transformed by the rise of electric vehicles, ride-hailing and autonomous driving.
Toyota's investment is likely to cost more than 70 billion yen ($650 million) based on Subaru's stock market value, said the Nikkei business daily, which first reported the news.
Subaru is likely to reciprocate with a stake in Toyota that would roughly equal the value of Toyota's additional investment, one of the people told Reuters.
Representatives for both Toyota and Subaru said the news was not something that had been announced by their companies.
Subaru is particularly strong in sport-utility vehicles (SUV) and all-wheel-drive technology.
The two automakers in June said they planned to jointly develop an electric sport-utility vehicle on a platform produced together, to split costs.
Carmakers around the world have been joining forces to slash development and manufacturing costs of new technology.
Ford Motor and Volkswagen have said they will spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles.
Toyota seems to be particularly keen to build scale now by investing in smaller, domestic automakers, rather than forging cross-border tie-ups like some of its rivals.
It has been looking to expand scale in next-generation technology and said this year it would offer free access to patents for electric vehicle motors and power control units.
Shares of Toyota were down 0.9% while shares of Subaru fell 1.5% on Friday morning.
Jurgen Klopp provides update on Sadio Mane injury ahead of Liverpool's trip to Sheffield United
Sadio Mane is available for Liverpool's clash with Sheffield United on Saturday.
The Senegal international suffered a knock and a dead leg in Liverpool's 2-1 win over Chelsea last Sunday and missed the 2-0 victory over MK Dons in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday evening.
But Mane trained with his Liverpool teammates on Thursday and Klopp has no concerns over the forward ahead of his side's trip to Bramall Lane in Saturday's early kick-off.
"Both trained yesterday, Sadio and Div [Divock Origi], completely normal, no issues," said the Liverpool manager.
Klopp also confirmed that Xherdan Shaqiri remains sidelined while James Milner is expected to overcome a back injury he suffered in the win over MK Dons.
"Shaq is not ready yet, he's doing rehab stuff," said Klopp.
Milli got a knock in his back against MK Dons early in the game, he looked a bit awkward after the game but he should be good.
Ballie Ballerson Soho: Exclusive first look at the new ball pit cocktail bar
Ballie Ballerson is opening a second site in Soho this evening, and the Standard has an exclusive first look.
The ball pool cocktail bar is opening a new venue on Berwick Street, with 6,000 square feet of ball pits.
Ballie Ballerson's original Shoreditch site quickly became a favourite with Londoners after opening in 2016, boasting the world's largest permanent ball pit.
Guests at Berwick Street can expect a colourful, neon-lit setting, and a cocktail list featuring the likes of the Soho Sundown - mixed up out of rhubarb gin, lemon juice, syrup and meringue.
Founder Wenny Armstrong told the Standard: "We have introduced touches, such as our Soho Sundown ball pit, to create a part of the experience that gently reflects the history of the area, as well as an exclusive Soho inspired cocktail and pizza.
Having a ball: The original site quickly became a favourite after opening in 2016
Our whole aesthetic has really taken a step up from our pop-up origins to meet the expectations that come with being in such a competitive location.
It could be the first of a number of new Ballie Ballerson venues too, with Armstrong also revealing that they're currently "seeking additional locations," which may expand into other parts of the country.
The original site closes for a refurbishment this month, and will reopen in early November.
Liverpool's Allison set to resume first-team training
Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker is expected to make his long-awaited return to first-team training this weekend.
The Brazil international has been sidelined with a calf injury since the opening match of the season on 9 August.
It will come too late for him to be considered for Saturday's lunchtime kick-off at Sheffield United but he is set to rejoin the group 24 hours later as preparations start for the Champions League tie at home to Red Bull Salzburg.
"Alisson looks like he is close, but the final word is with the medical department," said manager Jurgen Klopp.
He's not in contention for tomorrow.
Maybe he can train with the team from Sunday on.
I'm not a doctor, I take their information.
Alisson's injury was serious but in the last two weeks he progressed really, really well.
Credit to the medical department.
They have waited long enough to start him training.
There was more good news on the injury front, with Sadio Mane fully recovered from a dead leg sustained in last weekend's win at Chelsea and fellow forward Divock Origi back after missing three matches with an ankle problem.
"Sadio Mane and Divock Origi both trained yesterday and have no issues," added Klopp.
However, Xherdan Shaqiri, who injured a calf in training on Monday, is not ready to return.
How dare you?
Thunberg's U.N. speech inspires Dutch climate protesters
THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Thousands of Dutch children skipped school to join a global climate strike on Friday, blocking traffic and asking their leaders "how dare you?" in a reference to Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg's speech at the United Nations.
A participant holds a drawing depicting Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg during a protest march to call for action against climate change, in The Hague, Netherlands September 27, 2019.
Turnout at the march in The Hague exceeded expectations with organizers estimating the crowd at about 35,000.
Police were forced to reroute the march to a location with more space.
Thunberg, 16, gave an impassioned address at the United Nations in New York this week, after millions of people worldwide joined a climate strike protest last Friday in the run-up to a U.N. climate summit.
"This strike is going to have a lot of effect when people keep showing up, not just today but also in the future and we see different kinds of people from all walks of life," said protester Reinder Rustema.
Banging drums and holding pictures of Thunberg, protesters walked through the city center with placards reading: "For the Greta good," "Don't be a fossil fool," and "You will die of old age, we will die of climate change."
"I understand their concerns, I believe they are being heard," Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told journalists at a weekly press briefing within earshot of the protests.
We have presented very ambitious plans to deal with these problems.
But we have to do it in a smart way, which also creates jobs.
Thunberg's brief address electrified the start of the summit aimed at mobilizing government and business to break international paralysis over carbon emissions, which hit record highs last year despite decades of warnings from scientists.
How dare you?" she said, her voice quavering with emotion.
The Netherlands, with 17 million inhabitants, generated less than 7 percent of all energy from sustainable sources in 2017, compared to 15 percent in Germany and over half of all energy in Sweden.
The government has pledged to halve CO2 emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, but by 2017 had only achieved a 13 percent cut.
Thunberg was taking part in a protest in Canada on Friday where U.N. aviation leaders were gathering in Montreal to discuss plane emissions targets.
North Korea slams US "inaction" on lifting sanctions after nuclear talks
North Korea accused the United States of doing nothing to implement issues agreed on at summits between US President Donald Trump and the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, but said it is placing hope in the US president's "wise option and bold decision."
A statement from Foreign Ministry adviser Kim Kye Gwan circulated by North Korea's UN mission came days after Mr Trump said, without elaborating, that another summit meeting with Kim "could happen soon."
"It draws my keen interest that it is highly topical these days in the US to hold another DPRK-US summit," the adviser said, using the initials of the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
But he was critical of US inaction since the summits.
While past summits were "historic occasions" for the two leaders "to express their political will to put an end to the hostile relations between the two countries and have peace and stability settled on the Korean peninsula," Kim Kye Gwan said "no practical follow-up was made to implement the issues agreed upon at the summit talks."
The Foreign Ministry adviser said North Korea "has made sincere efforts to build trust" and implement the joint Washington-Pyongyang statement issued after the first summit between Kim and Mr Trump in Singapore last year.
He pointed to North Korea's repatriation of American detainees "who committed hostile acts" against the country and the return of remains of soldiers killed during the 1950-53 Korean War.
"However, the US has done nothing for implementing the joint statement," the North Korean official said.
On the contrary, he cited the resumption of US-South Korean military drills "which the US president personally pledged to suspend," and the ratcheting up of US sanctions against the North.
Kim Kye Gwan said it is "hard reality" that politicians in Washington are obsessed with "nuclear disarmament first" by North Korea before sanctions can be lifted and the country "can get access to a bright future."
The adviser said this makes him doubt whether "a new breakthrough" could take place in US-North Korean relations through another summit.
But he left a door open.
"I came to know that President Trump is different from his predecessors in political sense and decision while watching his approach to the DPRK, so I would like to place my hope on president Trump's wise option and bold decision," he said.
In his mid-70s, Kim Kye Gwan is a veteran diplomat who led the North Korean delegation at much of the now-dormant six-nation nuclear disarmament talks held in Beijing in 2003-2008.
In his speech to the global gathering on Tuesday, Mr Trump briefly mentioned North Korea, saying the United States has pursued "bold diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula."
"I have told Kim Jong-un what I truly believe: that, like Iran, his country is full of tremendous untapped potential, but that to realise that promise, North Korea must denuclearise," the US president said.
North Korea entered talks with the United States last year, saying it was willing to negotiate away its advancing nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees and sanctions relief.
The North wants a step-by-step disarmament process, in which each of its denuclearisation step is matched by a corresponding US reward.
The United States says sanctions on North Korea will remain in place until the country takes significant steps toward denuclearisation.
During the Singapore summit, Kim Jong-un promised to work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula without providing any timetable or road map for disarmament steps.
In Singapore, Kim and Trump also agreed to establish new bilateral relations and build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.
They met again in Vietnam in February for a second summit.
But that meeting abruptly fell apart after Mr Trump rejected Kim's request for extensive relief of sanctions in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, a limited denuclearisation step.
The two leaders held a brief, impromptu meeting at the Korean border in late June, and agreed to restart talks.
Indian Military Training Team Chopper Crashes In Bhutan, 2 Dead
An Indian Military Training Team (IMTRAT) helicopter crashed in eastern Bhutan on Friday, killing two people, including a Bhutanese pilot.
The chopper that took off from Khirmu in Arunachal Pradesh lost contact near Yonphula, the Army said, adding that the wreckage has been located.
In an unfortunate incident, an Indian Army helicopter has crashed at 1 pm near Yonphula in Bhutan.
The helicopter went out of radio and visual contact soon after 1 pm.
"The helicopter was on way from Khirmu (Arunanchal) to Yonphula on duty," the Army said in a statement.
Ground search and rescue was launched immediately from Yonphula.
The wreckage has been located.
"IAF and Army helicopters were also launched from Misamari, Guwahati and Hashimara," it added.
The single engine Cheetah helicopter was piloted by an Indian and a Bhutanese Army pilots, the army said, adding there were no survivors.
Boris Johnson attacks Scottish government for 'grave inadequacies'
The Prime Minister has attacked the SNP, saying he plans to introduce measures to "compensate for the grave inadequacies" of the Scottish government.
Speaking ahead of the Conservative party conference, Boris Johnson said he would accelerate measures to create "a much stronger Scottish economy" whether there is a deal or no-deal Brexit.
He also reiterated his strong opposition to a second Scottish independence referendum.
In an interview with BBC Scotland, Mr Johnson said: "They have the highest taxes anywhere in the UK.
They are not doing a good job on health, they are not doing a good job on education."
First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon has supported the possibility of a second independence referendum.
'I hope the money that we are now investing is properly spent on those services.
And I hope that Scottish Conservatives get the credit they deserve for the hundreds of millions of extra funding that we're putting into Scottish agriculture which was secured, not by Nicola Sturgeon, but by Scottish Conservatives.'
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already said she wants to have another referendum on leaving the UK in the second half of 2020, but Mr Johnson has previously stated his opposition to a second vote on the issue.
He told BBC Scotland on Thursday: "We had an independence referendum in 2014 and we made an explicit promise to the people of Scotland that this was going to be a once-in-a-generation event.
The people of Scotland voted very, very substantially to stay part of the UK, which was the right decision as this is the most successful union anywhere in the world.
They were promised this was a once-in-a-generation thing and I think we should stick with that."
Writing on Twitter on Wednesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described Mr Johnson as "untrustworthy, craven, not a shred of concern for the consequences of his words or actions."
She tweeted: "The Westminster opposition should unite around a plan to trigger the no confidence process to bring Johnson's government down, ensure the Benn Act is honoured and enable a General Election as quickly as possible.
Doing nothing should not be an option."
The Scottish Government has been asked for comment on the interview with Mr Johnson.
Jess Phillips says she got email threatening "you and your Remain friends"
Jess Phillips has said she feels "jumpy and worried" after a man was arrested outside the Labour MP's office and she received threats aimed at "you and your Remain friends."
The Birmingham Yardley MP said her staff had to be confined to her constituency office as a man allegedly kicked the door, tried to smash windows and yelled she was a "fascist."
She told Sky News she has received death threats overnight and has been left feeling "jumpy and worried and frightened," as she revealed the contents of an email she has shared with police.
"Unless you change your attitude, be afraid, be very afraid... wherever you are, keep looking over your shoulder," it read.
The person standing behind you may not be friendly.
You and your Remain friends have been warned.
The alleged attack on her office came as Boris Johnson came under scrutiny for his use of "inflammatory" language, with Jeremy Corbyn saying the Tory was encouraging people to act in "disgraceful and abusive" ways.
Ms Phillips said the Prime Minister "isn't helping" though she does not blame him, but added: "If he doesn't change his strategy, I absolutely will."
West Midlands Police said on Friday that a 36-year-old man remained in custody on suspicion of a public order offence and possession of cannabis.
Officers were called to the Yardley Road premises shortly before 2.25pm on Thursday.
It was closed to her constituency on Friday.
Ms Phillips was among the MPs to tell Mr Johnson to apologise for his language in the Commons, saying his choice of words had been designed to "inflame hatred and division."
She tweeted on Wednesday that she had received an "anonymous letter" to her constituency office.
"It was rather prophetic that Boris Johnson should say: "I would rather be found dead in a ditch,"" it read.
Mr Johnson on Friday doubled down on his use of language, refusing to stop calling a law aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit the "surrender act."
How to navigate the Sydney market this spring
House hunters need to have a game plan that they are prepared to obey to combat a turbulent Sydney market that is throwing up plenty of conflicting results.
Experts say that in a market that is seeing the Sydney clearance rate hover around 80 per cent and a lack of stock, buyers need to be patient to avoid having FOMO, the fear-of-missing-out.
Since the federal election, record low interest rates and the loosening of lending requirements, the Sydney market has seen plenty of mixed results, with many houses selling for hundred thousands of dollars above the reserve, while others are only just selling.
The mixed market has seen a small but stable growth in price, with CoreLogic August monthly home value index showing a 1.6 per cent increase in house prices.
REA chief economist Nerida Conisbee said Sydney is a tale of two cities at the moment and it is causing volatile results.
"The inner city and eastern suburbs are seeing the best conditions, with strong search activity that is now flowing through to pricing, while other parts of Sydney remain stable," she said.
Ms Conisbee said the price guides and reserves that have been broken by so much is from a combination of factors including limited stock, buyer confidence and real estate agents remaining cautious.
"It is taking a while for agents to get up to speed with pricing and the valuation may not be as reflective as the mood on the ground," she said.
However, while we are seeing many huge results, the data is still yet to reflect this at the moment, which may be playing a role.
Buyer's agent and CEO of Propertybuyer.com.au Rich Harvey agreed that there were pockets of the market that were not being priced to reflect current market conditions.
"It is creating false hope for many buyers who think they can have a chance for a property with a $1.3 million guide, when it will really sell for $1.5 million," he said.
To have success this spring, buyers need to be resilient and do their homework, Mr Harvey said.
"Never go to an auction without knowing how much you can spend, as I've seen many panicked buyers who go unprepared and spend more than what they should," he said.
If an auction goes above your budget and you miss out, don't worry as there will be another home out there.
Mr Harvey said buyers should also research recent comparable sales and know how the area is performing to avoid overpaying for a property.
Independent auctioneer and Sky News commentator Tom Panos said house hunters should also tread carefully and not get carried away with a lack of stock available.
"With a decrease of new listings putting pressure on the market, buyers are getting more emotional and are paying $300,000-$400,000 above reserve as a result," he said.
This was the scene a fortnight ago in Strathfield, where a six-bedroom property sold for $900,000 above reserve after an emotional auction saw two registered bidders who both desperately wanted the home refuse to give up, even as it sailed past the reserve.
Mr Panos said buyers need to have a walkaway figure and come up with a plan B to avoid only looking and settling for one property.
"Having a plan B puts a buyer in the best position to avoid putting all of their eggs in one basket and making irrational decisions," he said.
If buyers find their budget isn't working for them after many auction defeats, Mr Panos said they should avoid lowering their expectations.
"Don't fall into a trap of going for a home you don't really want as changeover costs are high," he said.
Instead, look at neighbouring suburbs that offer the same amenities for a fraction of the price.
With the Sydney market facing a shortage of stock, Mr Panos said house hunters need to be patient.
"Buyers need to tread carefully as we are going to have a late spring this year and there will be auctions all the way up to Christmas," he said.
Once the school holidays are finished, Mr Panos said there will be a rush of new listings from sellers who are eager to take advantage of a strong market.
It will also mean buyers should have more properties to choose from than what there has been so far this spring.
It also means that window of opportunity vendors have had with strong auction results these last few months will soften as a result of an increase in stock levels.
Currently there are 400 fewer new listings on the market this year compared to the 1805 at the same time last year, according to CoreLogic.
Mugabe Burial Set for Zvimba As Govt Gives in to Family Demands
The Zimbabwean government has given the family of the late former president Robert Mugabe a go ahead to bury him in Zvimba communal lands, Mashonaland West, instead of a so-called mausoleum being constructed at the National Heroes Acre.
In an interview, Information Secretary, Nick Mangwana, said the family has a right to designate the burial place of the former Zimbabwean leader, who died of cancer on September 6th in Singapore.
The family of the later former President R. G. Mugabe has expressed its desire to proceed with his burial in Zvimba.
In line with government policy to respect the wishes of families of deceased heroes, government is cooperating with the Mugabe family in their new position.
Government will render all the necessary support to give the late former president a fitting burial as led by the family.
Reacting to the latest development on Mugabe's burial, Maureen Kademaunga of the Movement for Democratic Change led by Nelson Chamisa, told VOA Zimbabwe Service that the late former president's burial saga will cost the nation huge sums of money as a mausoleum being built in Harare has been abandoned without proper consultations with relevant stakeholders.
The Mugabe family had said they don't want anything to do with the heroes acre.
This is something they were saying from the day he was declared dead.
So, they just went ahead and did that thing.
So they flushed money down the drain ...
Our members of parliament are going to be demanding accountability.
We want to know how much money had gone into that project and how they are going to replace that money.
The late president will be laid to rest Saturday, according to family members.
Justice Department To Open Facebook Antitrust Investigation, Source Says
The U.S. Justice Department will open an antitrust investigation of Facebook Inc, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, marking the fourth recent antitrust probe of the social media company.
Facebook also faces probes by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), a group of state attorneys general led by New York and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.
Large tech companies, including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google, have increasingly been on the defensive in recent years over lapses such as privacy breaches and outsized market influence.
Facebook has faced extra scrutiny tied to how it allowed its platforms to be used during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The company, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has 2.4 billion monthly users, recently paid a $5 billion settlement for sharing 87 million users' data with defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.
Facebook declined to comment on Wednesday.
Reuters and others reported in June the two federal agencies had divided up responsibility for the companies being investigated, with the Justice Department taking Google and Apple while the FTC looked at Facebook and Amazon.
The Justice Department later said it was opening a probe of online platforms.
It did not specify which ones, but said it would consider concerns raised about "search, social media and some retail services online."
Neither agency has revealed the focus of investigations into Facebook, though the Wall Street Journal has reported that the FTC's probe is focused on the company's acquisitions.
The world's largest social network has purchased nearly 90 companies since 2003, showed data from S&P Global.
The Justice Department's antitrust chief likewise told a tech conference in August that the government is looking at previously approved acquisitions as part of its broad review.
This led some industry observers to question whether the two federal investigations would overlap.
Lawmakers, in particular Sen. Mike Lee, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, criticized the appearance of an overlap in a hearing last week.
The agencies generally have a practice of meeting to decide who will investigate which matter but the FTC cannot probe certain areas, for example price-fixing.
The probe into Facebook by the state attorneys general, announced earlier this month, is being led by New York and also includes Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia.
New York Attorney General Letitia James said that investigation would look into whether Facebook's actions had endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices or increased the price of advertising.
Antonio Caruso to fight Amarsanaa Tsogookhuu in Jakarta
Antonio Caruso can see a lot of resemblances between AFL and fighting one-on-one inside a cage.
On face value the sports are polar opposites, but the training and mental dedication needed to succeed run on tight parallel.
And a new life in Florida, sparring with the world's fighters in preparation for his ONE Championship MMA debut, has surprising throwbacks to his amateur football days at Salisbury West.
"Imagine you're playing in the AFL but you're training with an amateur club, then you go out on a Saturday and play with the AFL boys," he said.
Of course you can kick and catch the same, but the temper, the pace, it's not the same.
Some days I'll walk away, some rounds I've lost badly, but previous to that, back home, I was never getting challenged.
The reflection was born on the back of a hard training session run by former UFC welterweight champion Robbie Lawler at Hard Knocks MMA gym - Carusos's home away form home.
The undefeated 28-year-old said the grinding work has him primed to take out Mongolian Amarsanaa Tsogookhuu in Jakarta on October 25.
"You can be on the mat at any one time with three or four champions, mixing it up with them," he said.
That's the biggest change here, there's no easy rounds, there's no easy work.
I can't run before a sparring session and then go spar, these guys will run rings around me.
But I feed off of it.
Tsogookhuu (5W-1L) made his pro debut in 2016 and won the MGL-1 lightweight championship title in October, before making the move to Asia's biggest MMA promotion.
But under the guidance of head coach Henri Hooft, Caruso feels like a new man.
Henri's so advanced as a coach and he's seen it all, fighters from the best days to their worst days.
"You can't buy that type of experience," he said.
(Tsogookhuu) has grown up different to me, but it terms of skills and ability, he's tough and has what it takes, but it won't be enough.
He's going to be strong, but that doesn't hold you too long in this game.
In the card's main event, ONE welterweight champion Zebaztian Kadestam will defend his title against Kiamrian Abbasov.
Energy suppliers accused of 'greenwashing' tariffs to attract environmentally friendly customers
One supplier states "electricity supplied to your home is 100 per cent green," which Which? says is "impossible" to guarantee.
The consumer champion is calling on the government department Ofgem to offer greater clarity on how renewable energy is defined as the current system allows suppliers to rely exclusively on REGOs, "greenwash" their tariffs, and do "very little" to support new renewable electricity generation.
Editor-in-chief, said: 'As consumers grow ever-more environmentally-conscious, it's concerning that some suppliers appear to be "greenwashing" their energy tariffs, which could risk misleading customers.'
We believe there needs to be greater clarity on how renewable electricity is defined and marketed.
People can only make informed decisions about where to buy their energy from if firms are more upfront and transparent about their green credentials.
For the investigation, Which? analysed 355 tariffs offering renewable electricity tariffs in June 2019 and found 20 suppliers selling 100 per cent renewable electricity tariffs without contracts to buy any renewable electricity.
World Athletics Championships: MP Jabir Qualifies For 400m Hurdle Semifinals, Long Jumper M Sreeshankar Disappoints
Long jumper M Sreeshankar failed to reach the final after a disappointing performance while 400m hurdler MP Jabir made it to the semifinals on the opening day of the World Athletics Championships in Doha on Friday.
Another 400m hurdler Dharun Ayyasamy, the national record holder, tumbled after the last hurdle in his heat to fail to qualify for the semifinals.
The 20-year-old Sreeshankar could only produce a best jump of 7.62m from his three attempts in the qualification B to finish 22nd overall.
His effort was well below his season's best of 8.00m, which he had produced only last month in Patiala.
Later in the day, Jabir finished third in the heat number one and 11th overall in men's 400m hurdle with a time of 49.62 seconds to qualify for the semifinals to be held on Saturday.
He has a season's and personal best of 49.13.
Ayyasamy could only clock 50.55 as he lost precious time after hitting the final hurdle.
He finished sixth in heat number five and 27th overall to miss out of the semifinals.
Ayyasamy, who had recovered from an injury recently, has a personal and season's best of 48.80.
The first four in each of the five heats and the next four fastest qualify for the 400m hurdles semifinals.
The first Indian to take the field on Friday was Sreeshankar, who has a personal best and national record of 8.20m.
He began with a 7.52m before clearing 7.62m.
He then fouled his third and final jump to end his campaign in disappointment.
The automatic mark for the finals was set at 8.15m but only one jumper could touch it.
The 11 other best performers went through to the finals with the least distance making the cut was 7.89m.
Sreeshankar's 7.62m effort here was his second worst this season.
He had 7.53m in the qualifying round of the National Inter-State Championships in Lucknow last month.
This season, he has been consistent around 7.80m with three jumps in the 7.90s, besides the 8.00m in Patiala on August 16.
Sreeshankar was, however, placed second last in terms of the season's best among the 27 jumpers who took part in the qualification round.
Karen Pence Was Reportedly 'Livid' With Trump's 'Access Hollywood' Tape
Karen Pence, wife of Vice President Mike Pence, was reportedly "livid" about that infamous "Access Hollywood" tape that surfaced a month before the 2016 presidential election.
Reporter Tom LoBianco, who covered Pence for The Associated Press and Indianapolis Star, reveals in his new book "Piety & Power: Mike Pence and the Taking of the White House" that Karen Pence was very unhappy with the recording.
The notorious tape featured Donald Trump in 2005 bragging about grabbing women "by the pussy" without their consent.
"Karen ... "was livid" at Trump's prurient comments in the "Access Hollywood" tape," The New York Times wrote in a Friday morning article covering LoBianco's book.
But her husband concluded it was too late to drop off the ticket.
On election night, LoBianco reports in his book, Karen Pence refused to kiss her husband.
"You got what you wanted, Mike," she told him.
"Leave me alone," The New York Times reported.
NYT correspondent Peter Baker muses that Karen Pence wields a lot of influence over her husband, who refuses to meet alone with women unless his wife is present.
Mike Pence, an Evangelical Christian, infamously said in 2002 that he "never eats alone with a woman other than his wife and that he won't attend events featuring alcohol without her by his side."
Critics slammed Mike Pence for the comment when it resurfaced in 2017, saying it suggested he doesn't see women as professional equals and that women who work for him aren't given the same opportunities as men.
The man in the "white guy blinking" meme is now using his fame to raise money for a Multiple Sclerosis charity.
Drew Scanlon, 33, went viral when he became the face of the go-to GIF for users puzzled by some of the idiotic comments being spouted online.
Now he has cycled 120 miles from San Francisco to Wine Country for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society with a team of 10 bikers.
He also directed his large following towards his fundraising page to amass more than $37,000.
Mr Scanlon made use of his Twitter fame to raise money for the charity bike ride, saying: "Hi Internet!
If this GIF has ever brought you joy in the past, I humbly ask you to consider making a donation to the National MS Society.
It would mean a lot to me and to those I know affected by the disease!
Over on his fundraising page, he laid out the reasons for choosing to support the MS charity.
He said: "I'm not usually one to toot my own meme horn but in this case I'll make an exception.
You see, two close friends of mine and members of their families suffer from MS, a debilitating disease of the central nervous system that interrupts communication between the brain and the body.
Millions of people suffer from MS and there is no known cure.
This is where you come in."
Uganda: Impasse On Uganda's Oil Sector Short-Lived, Says Museveni
President Museveni has said he is in touch with the executives of oil companies and was expected to meet with them at the UN General Assembly to discuss the current impasse in the sector and chart a way forward.
Mr Museveni, who was speaking at the 5th oil and gas summit at Serena Hotel in Kampala on Wednesday evening, said he "expected to resolve their issues."
I was supposed to meet them in New York but I had more important issues to do here.
We shall resolve their issues," Mr Museveni told delegates, indicating he would be meeting them soon.
This is the first time Mr Museveni is publicly speaking about the companies since the collapse of the deal where Tullow Oil was expected to sell part of its interests in the Albertine Graben to Total E&P and China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC).
The deal fell apart after the two-year grace period for negotiations expired.
The companies failed to agree with the government on tax and how much money must be counted as recoverable costs.
Tullow was expected to transfer 21 per cent of its 33.3 per cent in Kingfisher Blocks to Total and CNOOC.
Had the deal been completed, it was expected to pave way for the conclusion of the Final Investment Decision (FID).
This would mean that projects like the oil pipeline and the refinery would kick-off.
SNP considers installing Jeremy Corbyn as temporary prime minister
The SNP leadership is reportedly open to the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn being installed as prime minister on a temporary basis in order to avoid a no deal Brexit.
The Nationalists are concerned there is little time left to agree a compromise candidate among opposition parties to replace Boris Johnson, if he were to be forced from office by a vote of no confidence.
A new PM could then approach Brussells to agree an extension to Article 50 before calling a general election.
"It is increasingly clear that we will have to install a new prime minister via a vote of no confidence, so that we can request a delay to Brexit and hold an election," a source told ITV News.
The convention is absolutely clear that it is the leader of the opposition - in this case Jeremy Corbyn - who should become prime minister in those circumstances.
Trying to find a compromise candidate, a national unity candidate, is too complicated, especially in the time we have.
Whether people like it or not, the temporary prime minister has to be Corbyn.
The source added that the other opposition parties, and the 34 independent MPs, would have to come round to backing Corbyn, if they want to be certain of avoiding a no deal Brexit.
Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has repeatedly said she would not support any deal that saw Mr Corbyn become PM.
Meghan to 'fulfil her heart's desires' and refuses let own needs 'fade away' amid her royal duties
Meghan Markle is determined to 'fulfil her heart's desires' and not let her own needs 'fade away' now she's a member of the Royal Family - and wants to be a role model for young boys as well as girls.
The Duchess of Sussex, 38, reportedly made the remarks during an event for inspiring female entrepreneurs at Woodstock Exchange in Cape Town earlier this week during her tour of South Africa with husband Prince Harry.
Woodstock Exchange, the UK-SA Tech Hub, focuses on skills development and access to markets by assisting entrepreneurs, particularly women, to acquire skills, resources and support.
The Ladies Who Launch meeting saw the former actress, 38, meet with several women who have set up their own businesses in industries such as technology, conservation and fashion and praise them for 'empowering the next generation' of creative minds.
During a conversation with the female tech founders Meghan, who has campaigned vigorously for the empowerment of young women and girls, said she hopes to do the same for young men.
Mother-of-two Naadiya Moosajee, a South African engineer, social entrepreneur and co-founder of Women in Engineering, revealed: 'We acknowledged the importance of not just education for girls but being role models for boys - that we are women who are influential and who boys can look up to as well,' People reports.
We both have sons, and we were bearing in mind that we are not just role models for girls but boys - and not just our sons, but generally in public too.
She added that having Meghan present 'didn't feel hierarchical', as it was 'women gathered together and a talk about the struggles we have, as well as the things we need to do to move forward and grow and change our societies'.
Matsi Modise, founder of skills training company Simodisa, said Meghan is determined to continue to champion the issues close to her heart despite being a member of the Fold.
'She talked about being a mother and having duties as a duchess and fulfilling what her heart desires - and that it can't just fade away now that you're a duchess,' Modise recalled.
That you have to be true to who you are.
She said the duchess pushed them to plough ahead with their new ideas and spoke about how they have to keep pushing and going forward, knowing they are doing it for others who will follow.
'She wasn't referring to being a royal, but life in general when you have challenges,' Modise added, admitting she felt a bit 'awestruck' by Meghan.
'She radiates grace and she is taking this task that she has with such grace,' Modise said.
A lot of us have done amazing things as founders, but meeting a royal is quite daunting.
She made it easy.
She is an easy-going royal.
Meghan also revealed she's enjoying the pressures of being a working mother, admitting she finds juggling being a royal and looking after baby Archie 'a lot' but 'all so exciting'.
Speaking to mother-of-two Lara Rosmarin, CEO of Cape Innovation and Technology, Meghan said: 'We're only five months in right now.
'There are days when it's a lot to juggle but then you meet someone and you have an impact on them and you say "ah-ha," and it's so rewarding.'
Angola: Minister Stresses Need to Revamp Iron Palace
Luanda - Angola's minister of Culture Maria da Piedade de Jesus has spoke of the need to boost and revive the Iron Palace in Luanda, turning the site into a Cultural Center.
This was during an audience granted to the French ambassador to Angola, Sylvain Itté, on Friday in Luanda aimed at strengthening cultural cooperation between the countries.
Maria de Jesus said that the objective is to make better use of infrastructure and making it available to the public.
The one floor and three-exhibition rooms infrastructure maintains the originality of the material used, ensuring better quality of the structure.
The Iron Palace is a historic building believed to be the work of Gustave Eiffel.
Maria da Piedade de Jesus stated that the intention is to transform the Iron Palace into a space for cultural interaction, as well as serving as a workshop for the discovery of new values of Angolan culture.
Immanuel Christian School: Sixth-grade boys accused of pinning down black girl and cutting off her dreadlocks in Virginia
A black middle school student from Virginia is accusing three white boys of pinning her down and cutting off her dreadlocks.
The incident took place at Immanuel Christian School - where Vice President Mike Pence's wife, Karen Pence, is a teacher.
Amari Allen, a 12-year-old student at the private K-12 Christian school, said the boys called her dreadlocks "ugly" and "nappy" before cutting them off on the playground during recess.
"They kept laughing and calling me names," Amari told CBS affiliate WUSA-TV, tearing up.
They called me 'ugly,' said, 'I shouldn't have been born.'
They called me 'an attention-seeker.'
According to WUSA, one of the boys allegedly covered Amari's mouth while another held her hands behind her back and a third took a pair of scissors to her dreadlocks.
Amari didn't tell her family about the incident until after her grandmother noticed the length of her hair had changed.
"They ran off laughing, and I was just sitting there," Amari said.
The alleged incident occurred on Monday, but the shy preteen said she didn't tell her family about it until Wednesday, after her grandmother noticed her hair looked different.
She feared retaliation if she confessed the truth, she said.
"It's very painful," said Cynthia Allen, Amari's grandmother.
I want to see them dismissed from the school.
I want to see something done.
Allen's family pays nearly $12,000 per year for Amari to attend the school, which made headlines earlier this year after Karen Pence took an art teaching job at the famously anti-LGBTQ institution.
"We take seriously the emotional and physical well-being of all our students, and have a zero-tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse," Immanuel Christian School said in a statement.
We are deeply disturbed by the allegations being made, and are in communication with the family of the alleged victim to gather information and provide whatever support we can.
We have also reached out to law enforcement to ask them to conduct a thorough investigation, and further inquiries should be directed to the Fairfax County Police.
While the school has a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, Amari said the boys had previously tormented her.
She said that the boys have taken her lunch and called her names in the past.
Amari's family met with school officials Thursday, and the investigation is ongoing.
PM Modi Tweets Tribute To Jacques Chirac, Calls Him True Global Statesman, Friend Of India
Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the death of former French president Jacques Chirac, saying India mourns the loss of a true global statesman and friend.
Jacques Chirac, who supported India after it conducted nuclear tests in 1998, died on Thursday at age 86.
He served as the president of France from 1995 to 2007.
My deepest condolences on passing away of Jacques Chirac.
India mourns the loss of a true global statesman.
A friend of India, he played a decisive role in establishing and building India-France Strategic Partnership," Prime Minister Modi tweeted.
India and France have a strategic partnership, initiated in January 1998 during Jacques Chirac's first visit to India.
He again visited the country as president in 2006.
Jacques Chirac was known to have been suffering from ill health for a long time.
Mickey Arthur Says Remarks About Wasim Akram, Misbah-Ul-Haq Were "Dignified"
The committee decided against renewing Arthur's contract, which paved the way for Misbah to be named the country's chief selector and new head coach.
Arthur said he had supported the participation of both Wasim and Misbah on the committee but was disappointed with the decision after placing his trust in them.
"I guess the only disappointment I have out of the whole lot is that there were some people I really trusted who ultimately didn't follow through," said Arthur during the interview.
"And it just happened to be that Misbah was on the committee that didn't renew our contracts and becomes this heir-apparent," he added.
Arthur refused to speak ill of Misbah in the interview.
Misbah will do a good job, Misbah is a good guy and Pakistan cricket made their decision.
I was disappointed because I loved every second of that job.
The comments caused a stir in Pakistani media, where cricket gossip is widely reported.
Speaking to AFP by phone from Perth, said he had the right to speak his mind after faithfully serving the team for three years.
"I was dignified in my comments because I love Pakistan, the players I worked with, spent time with for three years and respect Misbah and Wasim," Arthur told AFP.
I felt disappointed because I had some unfinished business to do with the Pakistan team and would have loved to continue.
But now we have moved on and I wish Pakistan team the best of luck under Misbah.
Wasim and Misbah both defended their actions following the World Cup.
"I have played for Pakistan and I serve Pakistan cricket in some capacity or the other, so when I was asked to join the committee to decide about the head coach I gave my honest opinion," Wasim told AFP in Karachi.
Misbah added that Arthur was entitled to his opinion.
"I think what he has said is his opinion," said Misbah.
Whatever he has thought he has said.
I always say that everyone has his opinion.
As a member of the cricket committee we gave our honest opinion.
I had good relations with Mickey," he added.
"Good relations are always there and will remain there," the current Pakistan head coach added.
Passenger caught urinating on Sydney train
Disgusting video footage has emerged of a passenger urinating on a Sydney train as horrified school students watch just metres away.
A video of the incident, which occurred at around 8.30am this morning on a train travelling between Werrington and Kingswood, was posted to Facebook by Sydney woman Jordy Lee.
"Share this pig around," she wrote.
Doing this in front of kids on their way to school this morning.
The footage shows a male passenger, believed to be in his late teens, leaning against a pole near the carriage doors and urinating onto the ground.
The footage was filmed by two students as a way of exposing the man's vile behaviour, according to the Penrith Press.
The kids' mum then posted it to Facebook, telling the publication she was left in disgust by the whole incident.
"I am in total shock that this happened in peak hour on a Friday morning in front of children just going to school," she said.
It's an absolutely disgusting thing to do; my dog wouldn't even do that.
Her children told her the man was laying on the seats asleep when they got on, then during the trip he got up and started urinating on the ground.
When he was done he reportedly sat back on a seat and fell asleep again.
Facebook users flocked to the post to call out the passenger for his disgusting behaviour.
"What an animal!" one person said.
That is properly disgusting.
Mate take a leak before you leave the house," another wrote.
A Sydney Trains spokesperson told news.com.au that passengers should report this type of behaviour immediately.
"Sydney Trains encourages customers to remain courteous to others while travelling on our network," they said.
Incidents such as this are rare, however we encourage customers who witness behaviour like this to report it to Train Guards or station staff immediately.
The spokesperson said Transport Officers travel across the network and have the power to issue penalty notices and cautions for ticketing as well as "minor behavioural offences."
They added: "We also work closely with the NSW Police Transport Command, which is responsible for crime prevention across the rail network."

Carty is most consistent Irish out-half in 2019
Stephen Ferris says Jack Carty's selection against Japan is a reward for his consistency of performance over the past year with both Connacht and Ireland.
The 27-year old Carty only made his international debut in late February, as a late replacement in Ireland's rather unconvincing victory over Italy in the Six Nations.
He has appeared eight times since then, impressing on each occasion, including a delightful performance on being introduced in the second half of Ireland's demolition of Scotland on Sunday.
Carty has been handed his second international start against Japan on Saturday, the first coming in the World Cup warm-up win over Wales in Cardiff late last month.
A few years back, there was a host of out-half candidates vying for the tag of understudy to Johnny Sexton, and the Athlone-born out-half has emerged from the pack to challenge Joey Carbery for the role.
Speaking on the RTÉ Rugby Podcast, Ferris argues that Carty has been the most "consistent" out-half in the Irish system across 2019 - including Johnny Sexton.
I thought he was absolutely superb (against Scotland).
He recognised the Scottish defence and what he was up against.
He played heads up rugby at times.
His kicking game was pretty solid, he looked half decent in defence when he was called upon.
I would say Carty has been probably the most consistent out-half within the Irish system for the last year or so.
He's been superb.
Week in, week out, he's never really let his side down.
The likes of Sexton...
Johnny has had a couple of bad games over the last year or so.
He's been out injured.
He's been a little bit more inconsistent.
Whereas Carty has been really, really steady.
Against a Japanese team that are going to come out firing, they're going to bring huge support, maybe it is that steady hand that you need.
Maybe it is that game management.
I feel that he won't let Joe down.
I'm really excited to see him go out there, starting a game and seeing how he manages the whole situation.
It is such a big game.
Japan are our biggest threat I feel in the rest of the group.
But in saying that, I can't see a Japan team beating us the way the confidence and momentum is with the Irish team at the minute.
One hundred dolphins die on African beach
More than 100 dolphins have mysteriously died on a beach in the Cape Verde islands off West Africa.
Local media report that around 200 melon-headed dolphins were found on a beach on Boa Vista island on Tuesday.
Officials, residents and tourists managed to drag some of them back out to sea, but many returned.
Bulldozers buried 136 dead dolphins.
BIOS Cape Verde, a volunteer environmental association in the former Portuguese colony, said on its Facebook page on Friday it took samples from 50 dolphins and four others were placed in deep freeze by the local council.
The group said veterinarians from the University of Las Palmas in Spain's Canary Islands are due in the coming days to perform tests.
Paralympian to be first blind Dancing on Ice contestant
Scottish Paralympian Libby Clegg has been announced as a contestant on the next series of Dancing On Ice.
The sprinter, who won a gold medal for Scotland at Glasgow 2014 and two for the UK at Rio 2016, will be the show's first registered blind competitor.
The 29-year-old athlete, who gave birth to her son Edward five-months ago, has a deteriorating eye condition called Stargardt's Macular Dystrophy, which gives her only slight peripheral vision in her left eye.
She said appearing on the hit show was an opportunity that she couldn't pass up: "After Rio I achieved my ultimate goal and then I thought 'what else can I do?'
This opportunity came about and I couldn't pass it up.
I love challenging myself and experiencing new things."
The Paralympic champion will be joined by a host of celebrities including veteran comedian and TV host Michael Barrymore, Love Island star Maura Higgins and former Republic of Ireland international footballer Kevin Kilbane.
Clegg won't be the only Scot taking part this year with Glasgow-born actor John Barrowman joining the judging panel.
Each week twelve celebrities will skate live with their professional partners in a bid to impress both the panel and the viewers, who will ultimately decide who wins the show.
Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby will return to present the show which returns to STV in 2020.
Father son duo make Australian wheelchair rugby league history
As a father you really couldn't ask for anything better.
To get the chance to show what we can do together - here in Sydney - words can't describe it, really.
Cannane called for curious fans to attend the two Test series against England next month.
In his eyes, once you get a glimpse of wheelchair rugby league, you'll be hooked.
"It's a game that doesn't discriminate," Cannane said.
You can be able bodied and play and that attracts some great people to our game.
I play wheelchair basketball with Cory on Wednesday nights socially but he can't play in tournaments.
Cory and Craig Cannane will represent their country alongside one another.
To be able to represent our country alongside each other is really special.
Wheelchair rugby league was only introduced to Australia in 2009.
It is played across two basketball courts and features five players per team.
At least three disabled players must be on the court at all times.
A tackle is called when a player takes the tag of an opponent.
The Wheelaroos will first face England at The Whitlam Centre in Liverpool on October 21 before taking them on at the University of Wollongong two days later.
Senegal helicopter crashes in C. African Republic, killing 3
Three Senegalese soldiers died after their helicopter crashed in Central African Republic on Friday, Senegal's armed forces said.
The air force helicopter was returning from an operational mission with the United Nations peacekeeping force when it crashed in the town of Bouar.
Another person was badly wounded.
The U.N. mission said it appeared that poor atmospheric conditions had made a proper landing impossible.
The Senegalese were in contact with the U.N. to evacuate the wounded soldier and repatriate the bodies.
The helicopter is part of a Senegalese fleet working in Central African Republic, where large-scale violence began in 2013.
Armed groups currently control most of the country and carry out deadly attacks on displaced people's camps and other communities despite a peace agreement.
Matt de Grood shouldn't be punished because of schizophrenia stigma
In 2016, Matthew de Grood, the man who killed five people at a house party in Calgary, was found to be not criminally responsible for his actions.
Now, in 2019, there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms, such as unsupervised outings.
The decision won't come for a few more weeks, so in the meantime we're left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea.
There are two sides to this: one citing his violent behaviour in the past, calling to prevent it from happening again, and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation.
First, let's examine the more pessimistic side.
De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break.
It was a violent and unpredictable attack.
He suffers from schizophrenia, which is why he was found not criminally responsible, but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication.
His psychiatrist, Dr. Santoch Rai, has said in front of the review board that "if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence, it would be severe."
Despite his perceived improvement, there is still risk of re-offense.
But is this reason enough to remain afraid?
Is it enough to keep de Grood locked up?
As long as de Grood continues to take his medication, there isn't a huge risk of reoffense, so why are people so concerned?
I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness, particularly those with schizophrenia, largely influences this fear.
Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized, such as mood and anxiety disorders.
But others, including schizophrenia, remain highly stigmatized.
This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people.
That was the case in this situation, but these instances are rare, and that's perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur.
In fact, the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent, and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence.
In light of this, it seems unreasonable to insist that de Grood be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re-offense is based more on a prejudiced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood.
I don't believe de Grood should ever be unsupervised permanently.
A parole-like system where he has to check in to make sure he's still taking his medication could work well.
Arguing that he or other mentally ill people remain institutionalized unless absolutely necessary is a form of segregation.
It perpetuates the idea that mentally ill people, those with schizophrenia in particular, cannot ever mesh with society; thus continuing the stigma and perpetuating the idea that they are dangerous criminals.
He was found not criminally responsible by a court of law, so why should he be treated like a prisoner instead of someone who was ill and is now better?
Banks facing 'enormous' challenges - Commerzbank boss
The challenges facing banks are "enormous," Commerzbank chief executive Martin Zielke said today, after the German lender said it no longer expected a rise in underlying revenues this year.
The bank's downgrade was announced late last night.
It came as the bank's supervisory board approved plans announced last week to cut thousands of staff and close a fifth of branches following a failed merger with bigger rival Deutsche Bank.
Commerzbank, part owned by the German government after a bailout, has been struggling for years with a legacy of bad debts, high costs and fines, and tough trading conditions have hampered its recovery efforts.
Negative interest rates, increasing regulation, a weaker economy and tough competition.
The challenges facing banks are enormous," Zielke said.
Outgoing finance chief Stephan Engels added the latest loosening of policy by the European Central Bank "will not make our lives easier," and that a programme designed to cushion the blow for banks would not fully compensate.
Some investors said the bank's overhaul did not go far enough.
Commerzbank, which was ejected from Germany's blue-chip DAX index last year, has already been reducing staff and trying to cut back-office work to restore profitability.
It embarked on merger talks with Deutsche Bank earlier this year, hoping to make more savings, but the discussions fell apart.
The bank CEO said the overhaul would allow Commerzbank to stand on its own, but left the door open to future deals, saying the lender should be an "active player" in banking consolidation.
Over the course of 2019, the market environment has continued to deteriorate further.
This has been particularly evident in the corporate clients business," the bank said, explaining the downgrade in its revenue expectations.
The tough market backdrop comes amid management change at the bank.
It said that board member Bettina Orlopp would succeed Engels as chief financial officer, while Sabine Schmittroth would become board member for human resources.
The supervisory board also approved plans to sell a stake in the bank's Polish subsidiary mBank and absorb its Comdirect online brokerage unit.
The German lender flagged the strategic overhaul last week.
The measures were approved by the board during a two-day meeting.
Among the plans, the bank will cut 4,300 jobs in some places but add 2,000 jobs in "strategic areas," so the group headcount will fall in total by about 2,300 full-time positions, equivalent to about 5.7% of its workforce.
The mBank sale will further reduce staff levels.
Headcount will fall to 29,300, a spokesman said.
The company now employs about 40,700 people.
Commerzbank said the strategy would involve investment of €1.6 billion, with €750m going into new technology and the rest earmarked for restructuring.
The restructuring plan is negative for the German lender's credit rating, ratings agency Moody's has said.
The agency said plans to sell mBank would "further limit the bank's growth potential given that mBank meaningfully contributed to the group's revenue and profits, and its growth."
Alva Academy serving up World's Biggest Coffee Morning
Clackmannanshire: Alva Academy has raised more than £300,000 for Macmillan.
Macmillan Cancer Support's top fundraising school in the UK is celebrating the charity's 'World's Biggest Coffee Morning'.
Pupils and staff at Alva Academy will welcome the Clackmannanshire community to the school for a day for fun, games, tea, coffee and cake.
Dozens of fundraising coffee mornings are taking place across Scotland on Friday.
Alva - located at the foot of the Ochil Hills within Scotland's smallest council area - has raised more than £300,000 for Macmillan since 2004.
Over the years staff and pupils have organised events such as bake sales, bingo teas, sponsored silences and ceilidhs to raise money.
Last year, more than 1000 miles were walked, 1000 miles cycled and 101,450ft climbed - earning the school the prestigious Douglas Macmillan Award.
This year, pupils have already taken part in the likes of skiathons, swimathons, hill walks, dog walks and bungee jumps.
Their epic fundraising will come to a close following the coffee morning.
Teacher David Clifford, who previously accepted a UK Government Point of Light award at 10 Downing Street on behalf of the school, said: "Everything has gone swimmingly this year."
We have had a record number of sponsored events including a mass skiathon, swimathon, Ben Nevis walk, bungee jumps, dog walk, days of dance, football and a readathon.
We have taken musicians to four different care homes to entertain and held a bingo tea.
We have had our annual ceilidh - raising over £1000, bake sales, duck races and much, much more.
Top team: The epic fundraising is led by the charity committee comprising of David Clifford, Kirsty Clifford and Shiona Finn.
Mr Clifford - who has written a song to soundtrack a Macmillan video which will follow the school's thank you assembly - said there is never any pressure to beat a previous total.
Instead, the school believes the most valuable thing the youths can give is their time.
He stated: "Yes, it will be nice to raise a huge sum of money - but the money is simply a wonderful by-product of what we do and why."
Just seeing our pupils embracing our values of respect, determination and service is enough for us.
At Wells Fargo, a Jamie Dimon protege finally takes over a big US bank
Three decades before Charlie Scharf was named CEO of Wells Fargo, he got his start by mailing his resume to an up-and-coming banker named Jamie Dimon.
Scharf was a senior at Johns Hopkins University when Dimon hired him at Baltimore lender Commercial Credit.
That move proved pivotal for Scharf: He quickly became Dimon's right hand man and followed him for the next 25 years in a series of roles at institutions that reshaped the U.S. banking landscape.
"I was younger than almost everybody else by 20 years," Scharf, 54, told the alumni magazine of NYU Stern's business school.
That helped me mature in business faster.
Now, Scharf becomes the first of Dimon's proteges to take over a direct competitor to J.P. Morgan Chase, the U.S. financial services giant and the world's most valuable bank by market capitalization.
J.P. Morgan has been called a training school for CEOs as Dimon's deputies have gone on to lead vendors including First Data or European banks such as Barclays or Standard Chartered.
Scharf himself was part of that trend, leaving J.P. Morgan in 2012 to become CEO of credit-card network Visa.
He reportedly tired of commuting from New York to San Francisco for that job, and became CEO of custodian firm Bank of New York Mellon in 2017.
Investors cheered the news that Wells Fargo's six-month search had concluded: Wells Fargo shares climbed 4% Friday.
Scharf now has the biggest challenge of his career: As head of Wells Fargo starting next month, he will be tasked with restoring credibility with customers, employees and regulators after the bank's fake accounts scandal claimed his predecessor, Tim Sloan, and Sloan's predecessor, John Stumpf.
During his tenure, Sloan had replaced managers, revamped sales practices and launched an apologetic ad campaign, but he was blamed for moving too slowly as other abuses came to light.
Wells Fargo became hobbled under a rare Federal Reserve restriction that capped its asset growth, and critics including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Maxine Waters piled on.
"Just to reiterate the obvious: We know we have a series of regulatory issues that we need to complete the work on," Scharf said Friday during a conference call.
That is really the first priority, and we're going to make sure we don't miss a beat on that.
He gave few other clues as to his approach but added that, like when he joined Visa and Bank of New York Mellon, he was eager to meet his organization.
"In my experience, good business is all about stepping back, asking questions, and accumulating the expertise to make the best decisions, whether those are business decisions or people decisions," he said in the NYU Stern profile.
Ultimately, Scharf may decide to appoint his own direct reports in key roles like chief financial officer, as is typical when a new CEO is named.
To add to his challenges, Scharf, a low-key executive who enjoys woodworking in his spare time, will be going head to head with Dimon and Bank of America's Brian Moynihan as the U.S. megabanks tussle over deposits amid the larger push to digitize financial services and fend off technology giants.
Dimon, the mentor turned rival, seemed pleased that his former protege had made it to the big leagues.
"Charlie is an excellent choice," Dimon said in a statement.
He has great experience, and high character.
He is a first class leader.
David Attenborough to narrate 'Life in Colour' for BBC, Netflix
The BBC and Netflix are teaming up for the first time to co-produce Life in Colour, a new three-part series.
The BBC said in a press release Thursday that Life in Color explores the vital role color plays in animal interactions.
Filmmakers will use new cameras built specifically for the show to unveil a world of color normally invisible to human eyes.
Any series authored by Sir David is very special and this promises to be exceptional.
I am looking forward to seeing the combination of innovative photography and rich analysis to explore the role color plays in animals' lives," BBC Two controller Patrick Holland said.
Life in Color promises to be a unique and original insight into the natural world.
Deploying innovative new technology to reveal our world in new ways, I'm thrilled that we are working with Sir David on a series which promises spectacle and insight," BBC head of natural history and specialist factual commissioning Tom McDonald added.
Filming will take place across the globe, with particular emphasis on Australia.
The series will debut on BBC Two and Netflix in early 2021.
Attenborough, 93, has narrated several BBC series, including the Life documentaries and Planet Earth, and the Netflix series Our Planet.
He will also narrate Extinction: The Facts, a new BBC One special about extinction and its effect on our world.
'Keep doctors working until they're 70': Struggling Italian hospitals tell government
Regional health authorities are calling on Italy's government to allow them to recruit retired doctors and keep those older than 65 working until they're 70, as a means of tackling their serious shortages of medical practitioners.
Short-staffed hospitals across Italy are pushing for the retirement age of the country's physicians to be extended to the age of 70 in their regions.
The proposal is part of a 16-point document to be presented to Italy's Ministry of Health in the coming days which aims for there to be a "regulatory amendment on age limits for the retirement of medical personnel."
Currently doctors in Italy can retire once they've turned 65 or having worked for 40 years.
Struggling regional governments are calling for those "who reach 40 years of service at 66-67 years and would like to continue working" to do so.
Italy's ageing medical workforce is somewhat of a sleeping giant.
By 2025, 38,000 doctors will have retired (45,000 if you include general practitioners), causing a shortage that will be further aggravated by the fact that Italian universities are not able to train enough graduates to supply hospitals with specialists.
The regional health councils' proposal therefore also includes a measure proposing young medical graduates who haven't chosen a specialization yet to be recruited more easily as GPs.
Closely tied to this is the idea of regions offering specialist training scholarships which include a fixed contract at the end to young doctors, as well as forging a closer working relationship between local health authorities and universities, all as a means of speeding up the recruitment process in Italy's struggling health sector.
Regions such as Veneto have in fact already tried to take matters into their own hands by headhunting retired physicians.
Molise in the south has called on army doctors to help out and Tuscany has started recruiting younger doctors.
Renewed bid to find 65-year-old who disappeared two years ago
Police have issued a renewed appeal in their search for missing man Tony Parsons (65), from Tillcoultry, who was last seen two years ago this weekend.
Mr Parsons travelled to Fort William by train from his home on Friday, September 29, 2017.
He cycled south along the A82 and was last seen at 11.30pm that night outside the Bridge of Orchy Hotel, from where he apparently continued south towards Tyndrum.
Extensive searches of the area were later carried out, involving mountain rescue, air support, dog teams and civilian volunteers - all to no avail.
Chief Inspector Drew Sinclair, Clackmannanshire area commander, said: "Our thoughts very much remain with Tony's family, who have had to endure two years of not knowing where he is or what may have happened to him.
We are determined to provide them with answers and we want to ensure people remain aware that he is missing in case they may have information which could help.
Neither Tony nor his bicycle have been seen since leaving Bridge of Orchy two years ago.
I would urge anyone who believes they may have information or perhaps may have seen a bicycle or cycling equipment which looked out of place to come forward.
Please do not keep anything to yourself if you feel it is small or insignificant.
Allow us to make that judgement.
I would like to thank everyone who has assisted our enquiries so far."
Tony is 5ft 9ins and stocky with short greying hair and a moustache, and wore glasses.
He has a tattoo of an anchor on his upper right arm and a tattoo of an eagle on his left.
He was last seen wearing a red waterproof jacket, a blue long-sleeved cycling top, a high-vis vest, fingerless gloves, with beige combat trousers and walking boots.
Tony was also wearing a silver and grey cycling helmet, and was carrying a silver and blue rucksack.
His bike is yellow-framed with black handlebars.
Anyone with information can to contact Police Scotland via 101, quoting reference 559 of 2 October 2017.
Pompeo accuses Syria of using chemical weapons in May attack
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday, said the United States has concluded the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year.
Pompeo said U.S. officials had determined Syrian President Bashar Assad's government had used chlorine in the attack on opposition forces in Idlib province on May 19.
"The Assad regime is responsible for innumerable atrocities some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity," Pompeo told a news conference.
U.S. officials in May said they'd received reports consistent with a chemical attack in northwest Syria but did not offer a definitive conclusion at the time.
In April 2018, the U.S., Britain and France launched airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month.
"This is different in some sense because it was chlorine... but know that President Trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons," Pompeo said.
He added that the U.S. would provide an additional $4.5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to fund investigations into other instances of suspected Syrian chemical-weapons use.
Pompeo also called on the Assad government to release thousands of unjustly detained prisoners, including American journalist Austin Tice, who has been missing and presumed held by the government for seven years.
He is just one of a number of American citizens held in Syria and we call upon the Syrian regime to release them all.
Father Remains Hopeful That Suspect Who Fatally Shot Son One Year Ago Will Be Caught - CBS Los Angeles
LONG BEACH (CBSLA) - It's been one year since a 20-year-old from Long Beach was fatally shot, but the victim's family isn't giving up hope that the shooter will be caught.
"I wish I could trade places with you son, I wish I could trade places with you," Guy Alford, the victim's father, said.
Alford came back to the scene of the crime exactly one year after his son, Guy Alford III, was gunned down at a Jack In The Box near 52nd and Atlantic.
He said he wanted to call attention to his son's unsolved murder.
"Somebody knows something, they need to say something," he said.
Security video, which has never been released, showed Alford stopped in the drive-thru when a second car pulled up behind him.
Three suspects were then seen getting out of that car.
One of them walked up to the driver's side, and shot Alford.
The four people in Alford's car jumped out and ran.
The suspects were then seen getting back into their car and driving away.
"Wherever this coward is, he will get caught," Alford said.
This grieving father said he has no idea who would want to hurt his son, and he said he still didn't know who was in the car with him when he was shot.
"They upped and ran out of my son's car like that, where did you run to," Alford said.
"Did you go back and try to help him or what?"
Nobody said nothing.
Alford said his son was a star football player at Alemany High School, then a stand-out safety on the Long Beach City College football team.
Alford said his son was working toward playing for a Division 1 school and had dreams of becoming a nurse.
"He was working three jobs," Michael Harvey, a friend, said.
As somebody who's 21, he was a year younger than me, anybody with that type of hustle and work ethic, you tend to look up to.
As the investigation into the fatal shooting continues, Alford said he wasn't giving up either.
"I can assure you, this one is going to get solved," he said.
Alford is personally offering a $2,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction.
Anyone with information about this crime is urged to call Long Beach police.
Google bans 46 Android apps made by Chinese firm with 50 MILLION downloads - and it won't say why
GOOGLE has removed at least 46 Android apps used by millions from its Play store and reportedly won't say why.
All the apps belong to Chinese developer iHandy and will still be on your phone if you've already downloaded them.
Sweet Camera is just one of the many apps that has been removed despite being downloaded more than 50 million times.
According to Buzzfeed, Google removed the apps from the Play store last week but won't comment on why it has taken action against iHandy despite Buzzfeed asking several times.
This is the third time in recent months that Google has removed lots of apps from a major Chinese developer.
Buzzfeed has raised concerns about whether Android users can trust the ad and privacy practices of Chinese developers if Google is taking such drastic actions.
iHandy describes itself as "one of the world's largest mobile application developers" and claims to have 180 million active monthly users in over 200 countries.
iHandy created a popular range of emoji apps that have also been removed from the Google Play Store.
The apps that google has removed include selfie, security, antivirus, keyboard, horoscope, emoji and health apps.
In total these apps have been downloaded tens of millions of times.
One of the most popular apps is called Sweet Camera - Selfie Beauty Camera, Filters and its been downloaded more than 50 million times.
Why Google has removed almost all of iHandy's apps from its online store and ad network remains unclear.
Buzzfeed says that a Google representative would only confirm that an investigation of iHandy is ongoing and nothing further.
iHandy has said that Google's move was unexpected and it is still trying to work out the reason behind the removals.
We have reached out to Google and iHandy for further comment.
'Clickfraud ' software pretends to be a normal app on the Google Play Store, but secretly performs criminal actions out of sight
Arrest Warrant Against Rabi Pirzada For Allegedly Keeping Animals Illegally
A local court on Friday issued an arrest warrant against Pakistani singer Rabi Pirzada over illegal captivity of wild animals.
As per a report by The News International, The Model Town Court judge reprimanded the singer for disobeying the court's summon.
Earlier this month, Punjab Wildlife Protection and Parks Department initiated an action against the singer for illegally keeping four pythons, reptiles and an alligator as pets.
The action was taken against the singer after a video, where Rabi Pirzada was seen threatening Prime Minister Narendra Modi with snakes, went viral on social media.
In the video, Pirzada was seen posing with several snakes and an alligator.
Sudan: War Crimes Victims Accuse French Bank of Complicity in Regime Abuses
Sudanese victims of war crimes Thursday filed a criminal complaint against French bank BNP Paribas for alleged complicity in human rights abuses committed by Sudan's regime.
BNP Paribas has been targeted before over its dealings with Sudan.
In 2015, a U.S. judge sentenced the bank to five years of probation and fined it nearly $9 billion after it pleaded guilty to violating United States sanctions against not only Sudan, but also Iran and Cuba.
This case is different: Rights activists say it's the first effort to hold the bank criminally responsible for alleged complicity in crimes against humanity, genocide and torture in Sudan between 2002-2008.
It says BNP was essentially acting as the de-facto central bank for the regime of former president Omar al-Bashir during that period, by allowing it access to financial markets.
"These crimes do not occur in a vacuum and no funds," said Cynthia Tai, executive director of U.S.-based nonprofit Project Expedite Justice, one of the rights groups supporting the Sudanese victims in the case.
"They occur because people can buy weapons, they can buy trucks and because people can buy the tools they need to commit these grave violations," she added.
The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against Bashir on war crimes and genocide charges in Sudan's Darfur region but has been unable to prosecute him in The Hague.
The ousted leader is on trial in his home country on corruption charges.
"We can take them to court, and I think that will be a first step," said Abdalhaleim Hassan, one of the Sudanese filing the complaint.
He says the government-backed Janjaweed militia attacked his village in Darfur numerous times, killing people including relatives.
Later, as a student rights activist, he says he was imprisoned and tortured.
He now lives in the United States.
My journey to the justice will be long.
Not only the bank, but to bring the real criminals to the court," he said.
BNP could not be reached for comment Thursday afternoon.
But a spokesperson told the AFP news agency that it was not aware a criminal probe had been opened and did not comment on judicial processes.
This is not the first effort to hold French businesses responsible for rights abuses committed overseas.
Authorities here are looking into whether Lafarge cement manufacturer paid the Islamic State group to keep its factories running in areas it controlled in Syria.
Anjali Sualy is a lawyer for the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights, which is also supporting the Sudanese victims.
"We hope that by taking the step that we have today, we've put these companies on notice that they need to be aware that these types of business deals are risky," Sualy said.
French investigating magistrates must now determine whether the Sudanese complaint is admissible and whether to open an investigation.
Uber overhauls app in quest to build 'operating system for everyday life'
Uber has announced a slew of updates to its app - including consolidating its food delivery and ride-hailing services, and a new feature highlighting local public transportation options - in a bid to create "an operating system for everyday life."
Uber announced the more than 25 changes to its platform at a launch event in San Francisco on Thursday.
Among the tech company's most significant moves will be merging its ride-hailing app and food-delivery app Uber Eats, and offering users alternative travel information including bikes, scooters, public transportation, and even helicopters in some locations.
"We recognize that becoming an integral part of people's lives comes with real responsibility," Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said.
That's why we are working to make sure every customer is treated like a VIP, every driver and courier feels like a valued partner, and every city feels like we're a good citizen.
When riders search for a destination, they will see travel options listed in order of price, including public transit as well as electric bikes and scooters.
This means cheaper options such as subway and bus schedules may appear at the top of the list, and riders can request notifications when trains or buses they track are delayed.
The new transit feature is live in Denver and London and will soon be operational in San Francisco, Mexico City, and Paris.
It might seem unexpected for Uber to be guiding users away from taking a car, but the company has long harbored ambitions to become an all-encompassing transit platform.
"To some extent, we're competing against ourselves," Khosrowshahi told the Verge of adding public transit options.
But we have the philosophy that if there's a better product out there for the user, and we think an integrated movement solution is better for the user, we should be the ones competing against ourselves versus others doing it.
Uber Eats will also open more "digital-only restaurants" - businesses with no brick-and-mortar outlet where customers can only order food from on the app.
One digital restaurant comes through a partnership with the celebrity chef Rachael Ray and will be available in 10 cities for 10 weeks exclusively on Uber Eats.
Uber's big changes come as the company struggles to turn a profit months after it went public in May.
In August, Uber cut 400 jobs as it attempted to rein in excessive spending and losses.
In August the company reported its largest-ever quarterly loss: $5bn in three months.
Meanwhile, new regulatory hurdles threaten to raise the company's operating costs by changing how drivers are paid.
In the two-hour event, Uber did not mention Assembly Bill 5, a new law passed in September that will upend the way gig economy workers in California, including drivers, are remunerated, as well as the benefits they are entitled to.
Uber, its competitor Lyft, and other gig economy startups have announced a plan to fight the bill with a 2020 ballot measure.
In addition to platform integrations and Uber Eats changes, Uber made a number of safety updates to the app.
Riders will now use a four-digit PIN to verify they are entering the correct car.
Uber said it is developing an "ultrasound wave" technology so in the future the app can automatically verify riders are in the right car without a PIN number.
In the app, riders will now have a "Report Safety Incident" option and the ability to text 911 in case of emergency.
The company updated its "real-time ID check" feature introduced in 2016, requiring drivers to take selfies to verify identities.
The changes come after Uber was sued for $10m in April by a woman who was sexually assaulted by her driver.
A number of women announced last week they were bringing lawsuits against Lyft over drivers sexually assaulting them.
The victim in the case against Uber alleges that the company failed to "warn her of the risk its services posed to women."
A CNN report last year found at least 103 Uber drivers in the US had been accused of sexually assaulting or abusing their passengers over a period of four years.
Uber also announced an expansion of its Uber Rewards program, which allows customers to redeem points when taking an Uber ride, ordering Uber Eats, or spending with partner restaurants.
Cardiff council backs plan to give new streets Welsh names
Language campaigners have welcomed a decision by council leaders in Cardiff to support a plan to give Welsh-only names to new streets in the capital.
Cardiff council's cabinet is hoping the move will eventually mean there are as many Welsh street names as English ones in the city and bolster the language.
The council will also make sure existing signs on city centre streets will be in Welsh and English when they are upgraded.
However, existing street names in residential communities and suburbs of Cardiff will retain their current names.
Cardiff is not regarded as a traditional stronghold for the language, but the number of Welsh speakers in the capital has more than doubled over the past 40 years.
There are 17 primary schools and three secondary schools in the city educating 8,500 pupils in Welsh.
The policy, due to be put before the full council for final approval next month, says new streets should be given a Welsh name "consistent with the local heritage and history of the area."
It says the names of specific individuals may be used where there is a historical or legacy link.
More than 60% of people who took part in a consultation agreed with the proposal to work towards parity between Welsh street names and English ones, with the majority feeling the policy would have a positive effect on the Welsh language.
The Welsh Language Commissioner, Aled Roberts, said: "I congratulate Cardiff council on their new street naming policy."
Place names can say a lot about an area's history and heritage; and this policy in the capital shows the council, and indeed, the country's commitment to promote the Welsh language.
Mabli Siriol from the Welsh language campaign group Cymdeithas yr Iaith said: "We welcome the council's intention to name every new street in Welsh only."
It would give a boost to the status and use of the language in the city.
After all, the Welsh language belongs to everyone in Cardiff.
Caro Wild, the cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: "Ensuring that the names of new streets in the city reflect local heritage and the Welsh language will assist our vision of developing Cardiff as a truly bilingual capital city.
Adopting this policy will also see us joining other enlightened capitals around the world, like Wellington in New Zealand, who are embracing their own heritage by promoting the Māori language until it has parity with English.
It's very encouraging that the majority of people who took part in the consultation are in favour of these proposals."
The Welsh language is intrinsically linked with the history of Cardiff over the centuries.
By working towards parity between Welsh and English street names as the city continues to grow, we will ensure that Welsh history, culture and language remains an important part of the city's identity.

Kenya: At Shamata Stadium, "Keeper Can't Dive Due to Construction"
Shamata is the highest settlement area, in terms of altitude, in Nyandarua County and can be ideal for training for budding long distance runners, but only if sports infrastructure is developed.
At about 2,800 metres above sea level, the lack of properly developed sports facilities has left a lot of talent to waste away in this rural set-up.
Shamata is home to Ruth Waithera, the pioneer 400 metres runner who is first Kenya woman to reach an Olympic sprints final, a feat she achieved at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, USA.
She finished eighth in 51.56 seconds in a race won by American Valerie Brisco-Hooks in an Olympic record 48.83.
Shamata is in the Ndaragwa Constituency, whose MP, Jeremiah Kioni, once threatened to push for the area to be annexed to the neighbouring Laikipia County.
Residents of Ndaragwa, being in the extreme north of Nyandarua, seek most services either in Nyahururu town (Laikipia County) or Nyeri town in Nyeri County because reaching the County headquarters in Ol Kalou is expensive.
Ndaragwa lacks a properly developed public stadium.
The Nyandarua County Government has only fenced off various grounds in the constituency which are said to have been set aside for playing fields when the area was being turned into settlement schemes.
One of these fields is at Shamata township.
Shamata Ward MCA, Reuben Gitau says the land "will be developed into ultramodern sports facility."
"The stadium will have two pitches, track, handball, volleyball court and a place for indoor games," the MCA said.
A Sh4 million dais that is being constructed by the county government has encroached too much onto the existing football pitch.
Part of the dais has interfered with goal area thus becoming dangerous to players since the field is still being used.
The MCA explains that the whole stadium will be redesigned to change the current pitch from its present north-south direction to the unconventional east-west one.
Gitau could not immediately give the exact acreage of the fenced stadium ground but insisted it will accommodate a running track, two pitches and ball courts and indoor games facility.
Officials in the county headquarters could not say if a design for the stadium existed or if money for its development has been budgeted for.
Youth, Sports and the Arts executive, Murani Ngugi put the acreage of the fenced area at about five acres.
If the facility will have two pitches, then it will be the second in the region after the legendary Nyahururu Stadium.
Reports that Shamata will have a modern stadium has been received well by local youth who have been yearning for a place to develop their sporting talents.
The captain of Shamata FC, James Ndiritu, speaking after his team beat Leshau Pondo FC 4-0 in the final of Ndaragwa Constituency inter-wards tournament, said the youth are eagerly waiting completion of the stadium, hoping it's not hot air.
He said youth in the area have been lacking a place to engage in sports.
But it remains to see if the politician's statement will be supplemented by action.
In search of glory, Yemen athlete drowns in Med trying to reach Europe
Slim and with a tight-trimmed beard, Yemeni Kung Fu champion Hilal al-Haj dreamed of finding athletic glory in Europe, but a risky sea journey to get there ended in tragedy.
The 25-year-old athlete drowned in the Mediterranean after being swept away as he attempted to swim from Morocco to the Spanish enclave of Melilla last week.
His family in Yemen's rebel-held capital Sanaa was expected on Friday to bury the 2011 Yemen Kung Fu champion, who had also racked up a series of medals from Asian and Arab championships.
"He was looking for a country that would appreciate his talent and recognise his value as a human being and athlete," his older brother Saeed said.
"He loved life, he detested war," he told AFP by phone.
Saeed saw his brother just hours before he headed to Morocco, where on September 16 he attempted the dangerous swim to the Spanish enclave.
The athlete was proud of his heritage, his brother said, but competing in a country pushed to the brink of famine by a years-long war between the government and rebels had brought challenges.
Yemen was rife with "contempt" and "injustice," Saeed said, adding his brother was treated unfairly by the Huthi rebels who took over the capital in 2014 despite taking no side in Yemen's conflict.
After returning to Sanaa from a championship in Azerbaijan, where Haj won third place representing Yemen, he expected to be celebrated by rebels.
The answer was painful.
"They told him that no one had asked of him to raise the flag of Yemen," Saeed said.
Years of war have made leaving and entering Yemen nearly impossible, but Haj faced even greater difficulties when attempting to cross over the heavily fortified land barrier surrounding Melilla, on the northern coast of Morocco.
After two months of failed attempts, he decided to swim for it, his brother said.
"It was a short distance.
People before him have tried and succeeded," he told AFP.
My brother was athletic, it seemed like it would be easy, but tragedy struck and he was swept away by a powerful wave.
A friend accompanying Haj on the swim who managed to make it safely to the Spanish enclave said the journey was "extremely difficult."
"The waves were so high," the friend, who asked to remain anonymous, told AFP.
When (Haj) screamed, I thought it was because he was tired.
I didn't know he was drowning.
Haj's body was recovered and flown into Yemen's southern city of Aden on Thursday.
It was expected to be carried on to the capital in an ambulance, Saeed said.
Sanaa airport has been under blockade since 2017 by a Saudi-led military coalition backing the government against the Iran-aligned Huthis.
Haj's father and younger brother are expected to arrive from Saudi Arabia to attend the funeral.
"He always said that we can't reach our sports goals by staying in Yemen," Haj's friend Jamal el-Sabri told AFP.
The failure of the sports institutions, corruption and nepotism destroy sports and talent.
The more time passes, life is becoming more difficult and our ambitions are dying.
Financial autonomy, empowering institutes to appoint chairman on agenda
A new model of financial autonomy, an option for academically weak students to exit early and empowering the Board of Governors to appoint the chairperson are matters likely to be discussed at today's IIT Council meeting, sources said.
The meeting of the Council, which is the highest decision-making body of all the 23 Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT), will be chaired by Human Resources Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank'.
The agenda for the meeting also includes a proposal for the IITs to consider providing students an option to exit a course after six semesters rather than dropping out.
According to sources, the Council will consider a proposal to empower the Boards of Governors of IITs to pick their respective members and chairpersons.
Presently, the HRD Ministry appoints them.
"This autonomy is on the lines of what has been granted to the IIMs under the new IIM Act," a source said on Thursday.
A new model of financial autonomy will also be discussed in the meeting today.
The IIT Council comprises of top government functionaries, IIT and regulatory officials.
It also includes three nominated members of Parliament.
The Council coordinates the activities of all IITs.
It is mandated to advise on matters relating to the duration of the courses, degrees and other academic distinctions to be conferred by the institutes, admission standards, and other academic matters.
It is also expected to lay down policies regarding cadres, methods of recruitment, and conditions of service of employees, institution of scholarships, levying of fees, matters of common interest, and to examine the development plans of each institute.
Boris Johnson's tax cuts will cost £26billion a year
The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) challenged Boris Johnson's flagship policy
Warned giveaway "risks putting the public finances on an unsustainable path"
Treasury spokesman said: "Any decisions would be for the Chancellor to take"
The Prime Minister's proposed tax cuts will cost up to £26billion a year and mainly benefit wealthier households, the UK's leading economic think-tank warns today.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) challenged Boris Johnson's flagship policy to lift the thresholds for both higher rate income tax and National Insurance.
It warned the giveaway "risks putting the public finances on an unsustainable path," given the risk of leaving the EU without a deal.
Echoing criticism made by opposition parties, the think-tank also concluded most of the tax cuts would go to those on higher incomes.
The intervention will heap pressure on Mr Johnson to water down the tax-cutting commitment he made during the Tory leadership campaign, which he is gambling on to be a big vote winner when a general election is called.
Mr Johnson pledged to raise the threshold for paying higher rate income tax in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from £50,000 to £80,000.
He said he wanted to help the "huge numbers" of middle income households which have been dragged into paying the 40 per cent higher rate of tax.
The number of people paying higher rate tax has more than doubled from 1.6million in 1990 to 3.8million.
In its report, the IFS said the PM's proposed tax cut would cost the Treasury up to £9billion a year if introduced immediately and would take 2.5million people out of paying 40 per cent higher rate tax.
It described it as a "substantial and expensive tax cut from which only those on high incomes would gain."
Mr Johnson has also outlined plans to raise the point at which National Insurance kicks in, currently set at £8,632.
The IFS calculated that every £1,000 rise in the threshold would cost £4billion if they were increased in tandem.
Increasing all the thresholds to £12,500 in line with the personal allowance for income tax would cost £17billion a year, it warned.
The report said only 3 per cent of gains would go to the poorest 20 per cent of households as so many do not earn enough to pay national insurance, or are unemployed.
The IFS stressed the annual bill for Mr Johnson's tax cuts could range between £10billion and £20billion, if the tax cuts are phased in more gradually.
Antonio Brown says he's not quite ready for retirement
Antonio Brown has indicated he's not retiring from the NFL, only a few days after announcing he was done with the league in a rant.
The four-time All-Pro wide receiver wrote on Twitter on Thursday: "I'm still the best why stop now."
He followed with the suggestion that the game needs him.
Brown has been accused of sexual misconduct by two women.
He was released by the New England Patriots last week after playing only one game.
He's been dumped by three teams in the last six months.
Brown, who lost Nike as a sponsor last week, says he'll practice at high schools one day a week, starting in Miami.
The 31-year-old Brown also engaged in a Twitter spat with Los Angeles Rams safety Eric Weddle, who faced him often with the Baltimore Ravens.
Twitter Suspends Chinese Accounts Targeting Hong Kong Protests
Twitter said Monday it has suspended more than 200,000 accounts that it believes were part of a Chinese government influence campaign targeting the protest movement in Hong Kong.
The company also said it will ban ads from state-backed media companies, expanding a prohibition it first applied in 2017 to two Russian entities.
Both measures are part of what a senior company official portrayed in an interview as a broader effort to curb malicious political activity on a popular platform that has been criticized for enabling election interference around the world and for accepting money for ads that amount to propaganda by state-run media organizations.
The accounts were suspended for violating the social networking platform's terms of service and "because we think this is not how people can come to Twitter to get informed," the official said in an interview with The Associated Press.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said the Chinese activity was reported to the FBI, which investigated Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through social media.
After being notified by Twitter and conducting its own investigation, Facebook said Monday that it has also removed seven pages, three groups and five accounts, including some portraying protesters as cockroaches and terrorists.
Facebook, which is more widely used in Hong Kong, does not release the data on such state-backed influence operations.
The company also does not ban ads from state-owned media companies.
"We continue to look at our policies as they relate to state-owned media," a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to the AP.
We're also taking a closer look at ads that have been raised to us to determine if they violate our policies.
Though Twitter is banned in China, it is available in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region.
The Chinese language account, @HKpoliticalnew, and the English account, @ctcc507, pushed tweets depicting protesters as violent criminals in a campaign aimed at influencing public opinion around the world.
One of those accounts was tied to a suspended Facebook account that went by the same moniker: HKpoliticalnew.
An additional 936 core accounts Twitter believes originated from within China attempted to sow political discord in Hong Kong by undermining the protest movement's legitimacy and political positions.
About 200,000 more automated Twitter accounts amplified the messages, engaging with the core accounts in the network.
Few tweeted more than once, the official said, mostly because Twitter quickly caught many of them.
The Twitter official said the investigation remains ongoing and there could be further disclosures.
The Twitter campaign reflects the fact that the Chinese government has studied the role of social media in mass movements and fears the Hong Kong protests could spark wider unrest, said James Lewis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
"This is standard Chinese practice domestically, and we know that after 2016 they studied what the Russians did in the U.S. carefully," Lewis said.
So it sounds like this is the first time they're deploying their new toy.
Twitter has sought to more aggressively monitor its network for malicious political activity since the 2016 presidential election and to be more transparent about its investigations, publicly releasing such data about state-backed influence operations since October so others can evaluate it, the official said.
"We're not only telling the public this happened, we're also putting the data out there so people can study it for themselves," the official said.
As for state-backed media organizations, they are still allowed to use Twitter, but are no longer allowed to pay for ads, which show up regardless of whether you have elected to follow the group's tweet.
Twitter declined to provide a list of what it considers state-backed media organizations, but a representative said it may consider doing so in the future.
In 2017, Twitter specifically announced it would ban Russia-based RT and Sputnik from advertising on its platform.
Man set alight on doorstep 'in targeted attack'
A man has been set alight on his doorstep in what police believe is a targeted attack.
The 48-year-old was soaked in flammable liquid, believed to be petrol, before bursting into flames outside his home in Skelmersdale, West Lancashire.
He is in hospital in a critical but stable condition after suffering serious burns.
Police have launched an attempted murder inquiry after they were called to the man's house at about 1am on Thursday.
Detective Chief Inspector Pauline Stables, leading the investigation, said: "This is a horrific incident which has left a man in a very poorly condition in hospital.
We are carrying out a number of enquiries to try to identify those responsible.
While we are trying to establish a motive for what has happened, we do believe that the incident was targeted and I would like to stress that I don't believe there is any threat to the wider community at this time.
Someone out there knows who has done this and I would urge them to come forward and speak to us.
Has a loved one come home acting suspiciously, smelling of smoke or petrol or with unexplained injuries?
We need to find the people responsible for this dreadful crime."
Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting log 0065 of September 26, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
EBRR will Allocate 300 Million Euros to support Renewable Energy Projects in Kazakhstan
Renewable energy projects in Kazakhstan have garnered interest from international financial organizations.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will allocate 300 million Euros to support the country which is a regional leader in alternative energy development.
Meanwhile, renewable energy facilities with a capacity of over 900 megawatts have been launched in Kazakhstan.
Based on the results of the first half year, the production capacity was estimated at 700 megawatts.
The favorable investment climate and legislative base contribute to the development of the sector, said experts.
Currently, about 70 to 80 projects have been implemented in Kazakhstan.
Last year, an additional 30 companies have won an auction.
This year, there are many winners of the projects.
"This shows that the number of projects which were built in line with development projects in Kazakhstan will reach 100 units," said CEO of Renewable Energy Association in Kazakhstan, Arman Kashkinbekov.
Sir Bani Yas Church and Monastery: UAE's oldest Christian site opens to the public
Located around 200 kilometers from the UAE's capital Abu Dhabi, on the eastern coast of Sir Bani Yas Island, lies the country's oldest Christian site.
Originally discovered in 1992, the archeological treasure has recently opened to the public.
Named Church and Monastery of Sir Bani Yas, the site is believed to date back around 1,400 years.
Its excavation has revealed a complex history of the people who lived there.
"I think it's a misconception that there is no archaeology here," says Peter Magee, an archaeologist at the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture and Tourism.
There are other sites that remain un-excavated.
The archaeology here goes back 8,000 years.
In the early nineties, the rocky infrastructure was thought to have no religious association.
After further investigation, however, Christian crosses were unearthed, as was the architectural framework of a church and monastery.
The floorplan of the house of prayer revealed dormitories, a kitchen, cells and burial sites.
Decades later, a 2014 excavation team revealed further structures in the west, southwest, and northern area of the site.
Architects also found items which implied that monks living in the monastery kept cattle and made good use of the sea for food.
While other objects suggested they traded with their Muslim neighbours in the Arabian Gulf in the 7th and 8th century.
Today, a decorative frieze, which is believed to have framed the doorway of the holy site, is on display at Abu Dhabi's Louvre Museum.
"At least for 100 years, there was a Christian community here and Christians and Muslims were living very peacefully side by side," says Magee, adding that the monastery is one of the few historic Christian sites in the Gulf.
Other similar plots in the region include Saudi Arabia's Eastern province of Jubail and two churches on Kuwait's Failaka Island.
Lee from the USA enjoyed visiting Timgad in Algeria with her friend Monica, saying they were the most incredible ancient ruins she's seen.
And Mohamed from Libya stepped away from his medical studies to visit the ancient city of Ghadames in his home country.
Algeria: Brother of Deposed President Jailed for 15 Years
The brother of Algeria's deposed president Abdelaziz Bouteflika and three associates have been jailed for 15 years for plotting against the state, following an expedited trial.
Said Bouteflika was considered by many as the true power behind his brother after he suffered a stroke in 2013.
According to local news citing Miloud Brahimi, one of the defence lawyers, six people were convicted overnight in the closed-door trial in Blida.
Two remain abroad, thought to be in Spain.
Those currently in Algeria include Said Bouteflika along with Louisa Hanoune, the chief of the Lawyers for Workers's Party, and two intelligence chiefs, General Mohamed Mediene - who headed the secret service for 25 years - and General Athmane Tartag, a former ex-spy chief.
The remaining two, sentenced in absentia to 20 years, include former businessman Farid Benhamdine and former defence minister Khalid Nezzar.
It's the highest-profile conviction among Algeria's political and business elite since Bouteflika's ouster in April.
All four were convicted of "undermining the authority of the army" and "conspiring against the state," in a verdict delivered away from the media.
One of the lawyers told AP the trial was chaotic, with Bouteflika refusing to answer the judge's questions and walking out.
General Tartag had refused to leave his cell.
The defence counsel have vowed to appeal and express indignation at the speed of the trial and its lack of transparency.
One of Mediene's lawyers said he was "surprised by the severity of the verdict," while another lawyer said the trial was "political" and "an attack on democracy."
Army chief Ahmed Gaid Salah, has used these allegations of a conspiracy plot by the six against him, to push for new elections to be held on 12 December.
Pet owners who fail to walk their dogs face $2,700 fine
Owners can face heavy on-the-spot fines if they fail to provide basics like shelter, food and water.
People who confine dogs for 24 hours must also allow them to move freely for the next two hours or face prosecution.
The territory is the first jurisdiction in Australia to recognize animal sentience.
"Modern animal welfare is about considering how an animal is coping both mentally and physically with the conditions in which it lives," ACT City Service Minister Chris Steel, who secured the bill, said in a media release.
Nestle tightens controls on coffee beans after weedkiller scare
The world's largest coffee company said in a statement Friday that it had found glyphosate residues close to the maximum allowed in some deliveries of green coffee beans.
Glyphosate is the key ingredient in Monsanto's weedkiller, Roundup.
In the United States, juries have awarded huge monetary damages to people who say their cancer was caused by exposure to glyphosate.
Bayer, which owns Monsanto, says the herbicide is safe when used properly, as does the US Environmental Protection Agency.
Neumann Kaffee Gruppe (NKG), one of the world's largest traders, said glyphosate was one of a number of substances it monitored on the coffee it buys.
Nestle buys some of its coffee beans from NKG.
It was too early to say what consequences Nestle's tighter controls would have on NKG, a spokesperson said.
Nestle's (NSRGF) decision to increase the frequency of checks was unlikely to disrupt global coffee supply chains, a spokesperson said.
"This is not a new process, we are just reinforcing controls," the spokesperson told CNN Business.
Tests were done before the coffee was shipped from the countries of origin.
Nestle would start with suppliers in Indonesia and Brazil, since these countries are among the world's biggest coffee producers.
"Our agronomists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve their weed management practices, including the appropriate use of herbicides and adoption of other weeding methods," the Swiss company said.
Brands such as Nescafe and Nespresso make up a sizable chunk of Nestle's powdered and liquid beverages business, which generated sales of 21.6 billion Swiss francs ($21.7 billion) in 2018.
Nestle last year agreed a deal to sell Starbucks' packaged coffees and teas around the world.
Does glyphosate cause cancer?
Glyphosate is used on more than 100 food crops, according to the EPA.
Scientists at an environmental advocacy group with links to the organic food industry say several popular breakfast cereals contain doses of the chemical that are higher than they consider safe for children.
Still, the EPA says glyphosate is not a carcinogen and that it poses no public health risks.
Ecological risks include damage to pollinators and the problem of weed resistance, the EPA said in a statement in April.
But that has not stopped thousands of people from filing lawsuits against Monsanto alleging that exposure to Roundup caused them or their loved ones to develop cancer.
Earlier this year, a jury ordered Bayer to pay a California couple $2 billion in damages after they claimed that Roundup, used on their property for more than three decades, had given them both Non-Hodgkin lymphoma within four years of one other.
Bayer is contesting the verdict.
A 2015 study by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer found that glyphosate was "probably carcinogenic to humans," based on "limited" evidence of cancer in humans and "sufficient" evidence of cancer in experimental animals.
However, a joint panel of the WHO and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization later concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through diet.
Somalia: At UN, Somalia's President Spotlights Country's Progress, but Cautions Eradicating Terrorism 'Will Not Be Easy'
Somalia is "the perfect example of the success of the multilateral system," President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed told the UN General Assembly on Thursday, while acknowledging that the Horn of Africa country still needed international and regional support and cooperation, particularly to deal with threats from Al-Shabab.
Somalia's progress towards reconstruction was moving ahead, but Mr. Mohamad said "one cannot remain deaf and blind" to pockets of global discontent and the effects of poverty, inequality and unfair globalization.
He noted that Somalia played a leading role in the socio-economic development of the Horn of Africa and expressed confidence that cooperation among countries in the region would only strengthen political stability and social and cultural connectivity.
He went on to express his country's pride after the success of the regional elections in some of the Federated States ahead of the 2021 presidential and legislative elections.
And while he called Somalia "historic" example of reform, resilience and commitment to progress and reconstruction, he cautioned that despite tangible progress, the country still faced many challenges, first and foremost those related to security, on which "everything depends."
"With the help of our international partners, we are striving to rid ourselves of the last pockets of violent extremism and terrorism," he said, stressing that the task would not be easy, especially given the "violence, cowardice and opportunistic guerilla tactics of Al Shabab."
But Mr. Mohamed said he is confident that with the help of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and other partners, his country will regain stability, which was in the interest of the region and the world.
Turning to one of the key issues before Member States, climate change, he said Somalia which had the longest coastline on the African continent, was already experiencing the effects of rising waters and temperatures.
Somalia was also impacted by land degradation, long-term drought and deforestation.
Mr. Mohamed reiterated his commitment to the Paris Agreement, but also to Security Council resolution 751 (1992), which called on all States to take the necessary measures to prevent the direct and indirect import and export of Somali coal.
"It may not save the environment, but it will definitely deprive terrorists of a source of funding," he said.
J. Lo, Shakira to perform at Super Bowl halftime show
NEW YORK (AP) - Jennifer Lopez and Shakira are going to bring the heat to the 2020 Pepsi Super Bowl Halftime Show.
NFL, Pepsi and Roc Nation announced Thursday that the superstar performers, who have released music in Spanish and English since the 1990s, will perform on Feb. 2 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.
Lopez and Shakira both posted a photo of them standing side by side on social media to announce the news.
"Going to see the world on fire," Lopez wrote.
"It doesn't get any bigger than this!
So excited about getting on that #SuperBowlLIV #PepsiHalftime stage!" Shakira wrote.
Both Lopez and Shakira have had major success the pop and Latin charts over the years with multiple hit songs and albums.
Lopez released her multi-hit debut in 1999 and topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart with songs like "If You Had My Love," "All I Have" and the remixes of "I'm Real" and "Ain't It Funny."
Lopez recently wrapped up a tour to celebrate her 50th birthday, and her latest movie, "Hustlers," has been a box-office hit and has even earned her Oscar buzz.
Shakira released her first album in 1991 and crossed over with 2001's "Laundry Service," which featured the hits "Whenever, Wherever" and "Underneath Your Clothes."
The singer topped the Hot 100 chart with the Wyclef Jean-assisted anthem "Hips Don't Lie."
Shakira has won 11 Latin Grammys and three Grammys.
"These two remarkable artists are setting a new precedent for what this show can become, and we're confident that this will be an incredible performance for the ages," Todd Kaplan, Pepsi's vice president of marketing, said in a statement.
Jay-Z's Roc Nation company is co-producing the halftime show.
The big game and halftime show will air live on Fox and broadcast in 180 countries.
Japan Airlines seat map to avoid crying babies causes media storm
A feature on Japan Airlines' seat-booking system warning travellers of where young children are seated has caused a storm online.
The facility, offered as part of the airline's "Smile Support" travel service for those with infants, is not new, but still lit up the internet after a Twitter user praised it.
"Thank you, @JAL_Official_jp for warnings me about where babies plan to scream and yell during a 13 hour trip.
This really ought to be mandatory across the board," venture capitalist Rahat Ahmed tweeted.
A somewhat bemused JAL spokeswoman confirmed the feature, while also pointing out it was not a novel offering.
At least one other Japanese airline does the same: All Nippon Airways (ANA), where a spokeswoman confirmed its seat maps have shown where children are sitting "for a while."
JAL's maps indicate where infants under two are sitting, with a child icon to let "other passengers know."
The revelation caused an internet firestorm, with supporters and naysayers battling it out.
"Answered prayers," airline specialist site The Points Guy titled a post on the subject.
"But how long before we get upcharged for seats away from said babies?" one user asked.
Another called the map an unnecessary offering.
Why not just have noise-cancelling headphones?!
And some pointed out that babies aren't the only troublesome travellers.
"Can we use the same software to avoid people who eat noisily instead?" one Twitter user asked.
"Will airlines also have maps for obnoxious passengers that drink too much, remove their shoes, hog the armrest or recline in my lap?" added another.
Ahmed reported Friday that he had arrived in New York after his JAL flight.
"Ironically chose to sat next to several babies on my two flights: Some great, some loud.
It happens.
Some adults were worse," he tweeted.
New Delhi, Sep 27: The Army and Border Security Force (BSF) has sounded an all-out alert along the entire Indo-Pak border and LoC, asking border guarding troops and observation posts to keep a "hawk's eye" over similar air-intrusions in future.
GPS-fitted drones capable of lifting up to 10 kg of weight flew in from Pakistan seven to eight times to airdrop several cache of arms, ammunition and fake currency, which were seized in Punjab's Tarn Taran district, the ongoing probe by the Punjab police has revealed.
The Army and BSF officials said the troops and observation posts have been asked to maintain the highest possible vigilance along with the International Border and Line of Control (LOC) in Jammu, Samba, Kathua, Rajouri, Poonch and Baramulla, Kupwara districts of the state.
Doval tells security forces to put anti infiltration grid on high alert
It is a new modus operandi of Pakistan to smuggle arms, ammunition and explosives in India for triggering terror.
"We have activated our forces to keep a hawk's eye on movement of drones along the IB," BSF officials said.
BSF troops guarding over 180 kms of IB with Pakistan have strengthened their observation posts and "listening posts" to keep a close watch against any intrusion by drones.
The BSF is also patrolling riverine areas along the IB and has deployed water patrol teams in the Chenab river to foil terrorists' design to infiltrate into India from Pakistan, they said.
They have been told to shoot down any drone intruding into the Indian airspace, officials said.
The Army has also intensified patrolling in mountainous valleys and riverine areas along the LoC in Kupwara, Baramulla, Poonch and Rajouri districts to check intrusions of drones from Pakistan and infiltration by terrorists.
The troops along the LoC are on the highest degree of alertness in the wake of Pakistan's plans to stage infiltration and use drones to smuggle weapons, Army officials said.
A top Army commander on Wednesday said Indian armed forces are capable of identifying such devices and any military drone venturing into Indian territory from Pakistan will be "shot down."
Referring to the reports on intrusion by Pakistani drones and their low weight carrying capacity, South Western Command chief Lt Gen Alok Singh Klare said there was "nothing to worry" at the moment.
The Punjab Police on Sunday claimed to have busted a terror module of the Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), backed by a terror group based in Pakistan and Germany.

Tyrone's Gavin Devlin picks up 24-week suspension
Tyrone selector Gavin Devlin has been hit with a 24-week suspension following his conduct as a supporter at an underage game.
Croke Park's Central Hearings Committee (CHC) upheld the suspension proposed by the Central Competitions Control Committee (CCCC) following incidents during an Under-15 inter-county game between Tyrone and Down on 27 July.
He was accused of 'disruptive conduct not causing the premature termination of a game', by a supporter.
Devlin, who works alongside Tyrone boss Mickey Harte, didn't accept the punishment proposed by the CCCC and chose to request a hearing in front of the CHC, who found the alleged infraction proven.
Devlin now has the option to go to the GAA's Central Appeals Committee in an attempt to have his punishment overturned.
Assuming that the suspension starts from the issuing of the CHC's findings on Thursday, Devlin will be ruled out of all involvement with the Tyrone squad until early March, well into the 2020 Allianz League campaign.
Former Tipperary hurler Eoin Brislane has been suspended for a total of 16 weeks arising from an incident in Tipp's Under-15 Arrabawn Hurling Tournament match with Wexford on 31 August.
The CCCC had proposed two separate bans on the grounds that Brislane had used abusive language towards a referee and for "any type of assault of a referee" under Rule 7.2 (c) of the official guide.
The CHC upheld the first of those, imposing a four-week ban, though found the second alleged infraction unproven.
They found, however, that "the evidence presented did disclose a lesser infraction."
That infraction was "minor physical interference with a referee" and imposed a 12-week suspension.
Like Devlin, Brislane can ask for his case to go before the CAC.
Nigeria: Sowore - Court Threatens Imprisonment of SSS Director
The Federal High Court, Abuja Division, has issued a warning that it would order the imprisonment of the Director-General of the State Security Service (SSS), Yusuf Bichi
The court gave the warning on Thursday in response to the failure of the SSS to release the detained publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore.
The court's warning was also based on an application by Mr Sowore's lawyers led by senior advocate Femi Falana.
A copy of the court order dated September 26 said the SSS must release Mr Sowore as directed by the court or it would be guilty of contempt and liable to be committed to prison.
"Take notice that unless you obey the order of the Federal High Court, Abuja Division delivered on September 24 which ordered you to release the applicant, you will be guilty of contempt of court and will be liable to be committed to prison," the document read.
The Federal High Court had ordered the immediate release of Mr Sowore from prison on Tuesday after ruling that there was no longer a valid reason to continue detaining the respondent.
Mr Sowore, who was arrested on August 3 for planning a protest popularised with the hashtag #RevolutionNow, is facing trial on seven counts for alleged treasonable felony, fraud and cyberstalking.
The SSS also accused Mr Sowore of disseminating an interview wherein he made utterances termed by the prosecution as "insulting, causing hatred and enmity" to the person of President Muhammadu Buhari.
The charge sheet also included an allegation that Mr Sowore and another defendant, Olawale Bakare, planned the protest to overthrow the incumbent government.
The SSS had obtained two separate orders for Mr Sowore's detention till September 21.
At the expiration of those orders, the SSS informed the court of an application earlier seeking further detention of Mr Sowore for 20 days.
It also notified the court that the recent application had been overtaken by events based on the provisions of the law, since the SSS had filed an information before the court suggesting that investigations had been concluded regarding allegations against Mr Sowore.
Despite that declaration by the SSS lawyer, G. A. Agbadua, the prosecution still hinted the court of its desire to continue detaining Mr Sowore.
Mr Agbadua argued that the allegations against Mr Sowore attracted capital punishment and that bail in such circumstances where highly restricted.
That claim was, however, refuted by Mr Sowore's lawyer, Femi Falana, who told the court that Mr Agbadua was misleading the court with his claim that allegations against Mr Sowore attracted capital punishment.
Mr Sowore met all the bail conditions on Wednesday, as certified by the court, and the SSS was promptly notified.
However, in an interview with PREMIUM TIMES Thursday, a lawyer from Mr Falana's Chambers, Marshal Abubakar, said they were still expecting to hear from the SSS after leaving the office of the security agency on Wednesday night without the detained publisher.
He said the SSS officials explained that they were awaiting a directive for Mr Sowore's release from Mr Bichi.
Why you should buy Herman Miller and Steelcase's stocks
U.S. businesses may be showing some signs of weakness, but that shouldn't scare you away from buying the stock of two office furniture companies, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.
Not only are Herman Miller and Steelcase are defying conventional wisdom, but they also have room to continue rising, the "Mad Money" host contended.
Herman Miller, a Zeeland, Michigan-based maker of high-end office furniture, has seen its stock rise 52% for the year, Cramer noted.
It closed at $45.98 on Thursday.
Steelcase, which is based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and is a leading supplier of products for the office environment, is up 24%, Cramer said.
Its stock was at $18.40 at Thursday's close.
Cramer said there are two main reasons why the companies are having success, despite recession fears and the U.S.-China trade war.
The first is the tight labor market.
Currently, the U.S. jobless rate is 3.7%.
Compared with other business expenditures, "fancy office furniture is tied much more, much more, tightly to the labor market," Cramer explained.
"A tight labor market means workers have more leverage, and when workers have more leverage, they get the nice office chairs with lumbar support," Cramer said, alluding to Herman Miller's Aeron chairs.
The second factor, Cramer said, is better execution and falling commodity prices, which has allowed the furniture makers to be hurt less by tariffs.
Both companies do a lot of sourcing from China, Cramer said.
"In fact, in a perverse way, the tariffs might be helping, because they're contributing to the worldwide slowdown that's driving down commodity prices, giving Herman Miller and Steelcase lower raw costs," Cramer said.
Perhaps the thing Cramer likes most about the two companies?
They are still "absurdly cheap, selling for about 12 times next year's earning estimates," Cramer said.
"In a market that's increasingly wary of high-flying stocks with nosebleed valuations, these two value plays could be just what the doctor ordered," Cramer said.
Last week, both Herman Miller and Steelcase beat earnings expectations.
In addition, Herman Miller reported 7.4% sales growth compared with the same quarter last year, while Steelcase's revenue was up 14% in that same time frame.
That caught Wall Street's attention, but Cramer said he thinks the two companies are still worth buying.
"Even after last week's explosive rallies, I bet they can go higher still," he said.
Harker says Fed should 'hold firm' on interest rates
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker thinks interest rates should hold steady as events unfold in what he called a strong economy that also has "clear downside risks."
"My own view is that we should hold firm, letting things settle and watching how events play out," he said in prepared remarks Friday to the Shadow Open Market Committee of economists who monitor Fed activity.
Harker, a nonvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, spoke nine days after his fellow central bankers voted to cut the Fed's benchmark interest rate by a quarter, the second reduction this year.
He said he views the economy as strong with inflation on its way to the Fed's 2% goal.
Yet he also noted potential problems with "trade and international developments and the uncertainty they breed."
Along with his views on rates, Harker also weighed in on last week's tumult in the overnight lending, or repo, market that saw short-term rates spike to 10% and the fed funds rate climb 5 basis points above its target range.
While the events shook markets, "they neither reflect - nor direct - the stance of monetary policy.
Nor do they have implications for the wider economy," he said.
However, he added that the Fed should continue to look at its approach to where it is holding its balance sheet and said "organic" expansion should be considered.
Gamers get chance to compete at Euros
UEFA has opened registration for esports competitors to represent their national teams at the inaugural eEURO 2020, with the qualifying phase kicking off in November 2019.
Players from all 55 of UEFA's national associations will look to qualify for the final tournament in London from 9-10 July, a couple of days before the final of the main European Championship at Wembley Stadium on 12 July.
Gamers will compete in Konami's eFootball Pro Evolution Soccer 2020 (PES 20) on the Playstation 4 video game console.
Between November 2019 and January 2020, each national association will nominate their team, with participants being chosen through either a domestic online or physical tournament - unless a national eFootball team already exists.
A draw will take place in January 2020.
It will divide the participating nations into 10 groups for the online qualifying phase, to be contested between March and May 2020.
The winner of each group and the best six runners-up will qualify for the final tournament in London.
"eFootball is played by tens of millions of people across the continent and we are delighted to give competitors from our national associations the chance to represent their country on the biggest stage," said UEFA marketing director Guy-Laurent Epstein.
We have seen a massive growth in the popularity of eFootball over the past few years and the eEURO 2020 will give us the opportunity to connect with new and existing fans of national-team football.
A total of $100,000 in cash prizes will be split between the quarter-finalists, including $40,000 for the winners.
The champions will also receive tickets to watch the final of EURO 2020.
Lil Wayne ordered to pay over $150K in phony concert case
Lil Wayne is up for about $150,000 in charges for allegedly creating fraudulent companies to book fake concerts and it turns out he didn't even bother to respond to the lawsuit.
According to TMZ, a judge has ordered the rapper to cough up $150K for breach of contract and fraud to investor Ramin Natan but it's a default judgment with the judge having ruled for Natan because Wayne didn't show.
The suit was apparently filed by Natan against Lil Wayne and hip-hop group Migos back in January, in which the investor claimed they were "Ponzi scheme artists" who created shell companies to get money for shows they never actually planned to perform.
The legal docs reportedly show Natan claimed he loaned $500,000 to a guy named Eric Stenger to promote Weezy shows.
Natan claimed Stenger collaborated with Wayne from the beginning and lied about being a concert promoter.
He said Wayne received the $500,000 investment from him but then never performed and also never gave back the cash.
According to the legal docs, Lil Wayne was served with the lawsuit but he failed to respond, so the judge issued a default judgment against Weezy.
Typically, the courts will give a defendant one last chance to respond.
This is the latest in a string of legal troubles for the 36-year-old.
Earlier this year he threatened his former record company Moments in Time with legal action because they wouldn't return an old lyric notebook of his, instead they were trying to auction it for £189,600.
He also filed a £15.2 million lawsuit against former attorney Ronald Sweeney for allegedly tricking him out of the same amount while he represented the musician for 13 years.
The issues have ranged from policy disputes to legal challenges around immigration, automobile efficiency and housing.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler's letter to Governor Gavin Newsom said the governor and the mayors of San Francisco and Los Angeles "do not appear to be acting with urgency" to mitigate the public health risks from "untreated human waste entering nearby waters."
Wheeler said the state was "failing to meet its obligation required under delegated federal programs" and that he wanted the state to detail how it will respond.
San Francisco Mayor London Breed accused Trump of "taking swipes" at her city for "no reason other than politics.
"There are no needles washing out to the Bay or Ocean from our sewer system, and there is no relationship between homelessness and water quality in San Francisco," she said in a statement.
"I would love to have a President that wants to work with us on solutions to the challenges we face, whether that be with our infrastructure, our need for more housing, or helping people exit homelessness."
Eric Schaeffer, director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former top enforcement official at EPA, said the agency's current focus on homeless encampments is misdirected when it "has done so little to enforce illegal discharges from much larger sources across the US."
EIP has found that sources like factory farms and coal ash dumps near power plants are major sources of water pollution and have not faced EPA enforcement.
Earlier this week, Newsom said at a United Nations Climate Summit that he was "humiliated" by Trump's environmental record.
The administration has rolled back numerous environmental protections, from the Endangered Species Act to Obama-era climate rules, that Trump has called obstacles to economic development.
During a fundraising trip last week in California, Trump had threatened to have the federal government step in to "clean up" the homeless problem there and said floated the idea of the EPA going after San Francisco for allowing drainage from homeless encampments into the Pacific ocean.
Last week, Trump revoked California's decades-old authority to set its own emissions standards for automobiles, prompting a lawsuit days later by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has sued the administration over 60 times on various issues.
Zimbabwe: 'Poisoned' Doctor Leaves Country for Treatment
A doctor in Zimbabwe who was abducted and allegedly tortured for leading a doctors strike left the country late Thursday for what his medical team calls "urgent" treatment in South Africa.
Dr. Peter Magombeyi, acting president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, had been receiving care in Harare for a week since his release from captivity.
Friends and colleagues suspect he was poisoned during his five-day abduction and now has liver damage.
His father, Kingstone Magombeyi, had been staying with him at the hospital since his release last Thursday.
"I am very happy for that step taken by the medical practitioners, am very happy on that one, because there are some areas whereby l feel he needs further medication," Kingstone Magombeyi said.
Peter Magombeyi's departure for South Africa only came after the head of the High Court, George Chiweshe, chastised police who had defied a court order and blocked the doctor from leaving.
Monica Mutsvangwa, Zimbabwe's Information Minister, maintains police interfered with Magombeyi's departure for safety and health reasons.
"The police are keen to apprehend the alleged abductors so as to bring them to justice and protect the public," Mutsvangwa said.
They therefore need the court's assistance in delaying Dr. Magombeyi's departure to South Africa, before him giving the vital leads they need to advance their investigations.
It is the duty of the police to protect the safety of all its citizens.
While Magombeyi has left Zimbabwe for medical treatment, his association says doctors are not calling off their three-week strike.
His colleagues say the outspoken doctor was abducted for calling the strike on Sept. 3 to push President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government to raise doctors' salaries, currently equal to less than $200 per month.
With land out of bounds, Pak terrorists plan to infiltrate through the skies and seas
New Delhi, Sep 27: Almost all top terror groups in Pakistan have activated their modules, training camps just to name a few.
However, over the past couple of weeks, the Indian intelligence has been picking up information about the opening up of the aquatic training centres of both the Lashkar-e-Tayiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad.
It was back in January that the Intelligence had first signalled that Pakistan is urging its terror groups to go ahead with Operation Samudari.
Officials tell OneIndia that terror groups would look to use various techniques as the land is becoming difficult to access owing to the huge security build-up.
The incident in which Pakistan used drones to send in arms and ammunition is one such example of how the tactics are changing.
While the Balakot camp was reactivated by the Jaish-e-Mohammad, the Lashkar-e-Tayiba to has activated two of its maritime camps at Mirpur and Sialkot.
Officials say that as the latest information available, Pakistan based terrorist camps continue to train cadres for underwater strikes.
The intention would also be to infiltrate terrorists through the waters, IB officials further note.
Several intelligence reports available with OneIndia state that the naval wing of these groups is handled by the Musa Company, which is the special services group of the Pakistan Army.
The naval wing of these terrorist groups is not often used by terror groups.
It is part of the surprise element, the reports state.
Since 2004, it had become mandatory for every Lashkar-e-Tayiba recruit to undergo a certain amount of maritime training.
This apart, the terrorists also take part in classes on elementary flying.
As part of the training programme, the first class is held in Thakot and then at Murdike.
The training programme comes to a close at Karachi and each of these sessions is conducted by officers of the Musa company.
In the days to come the sea route would be the most preferred for terrorists.
It is impossible to man the entire sea and hence in this regard, intelligence and coordination become the key.
In addition to this, there is also a dire need to introduce hi-tech technology to aid the Intelligence Bureau.
The reason why Intelligence, technology and coordination becomes crucial is that 90 per cent of the world trade is sea-based and it is impossible to man each and every vessel on the sea.
The smaller ones, in particular, pose the maximum danger.
Three People in the CAR Died in UN Helicopter Crash
Three people died and another one was injured in a helicopter crash of the Senegalese armed forces in the city of Buar in the west of the CAR fulfilling an operation under the leadership of the UN Peacekeeping Mission.
The portal DakarActu wrote about this on Friday, citing the Senegalese military.
Head of Mission Mankeur Ndiaye confirmed the information about the crash, noting that the helicopter crash occurred during landing.
According to DakarActu, the Mi-35 helicopter was returning from an operation combating militant groups.
The Senegalese army reported that it is in contact with the UN regarding the evacuation of the injured and bodies of the deceased.
The coordinator of Navalny's Arkhangelsk headquarters was sentenced to community service
The Oktyabrsky district court of Arkhangelsk delivered its sentencing of the coordinator of Alexei Navalny's regional headquarters Andrei Borovikov.
For repeated infringements of the rules for conducting public gatherings (art. 212.1 of the Russian Criminal Code) the court sentenced him to 400 hours of community service, a Kommersant correspondent reports from the courtroom.
The case was opened in April of this year for organizing protests against the construction of a garbage disposal site in Arkhangelsk region.
The first to be sentenced to three years' imprisonment under art. 212.1 of the Russian Criminal Code was activist Ildar Dadin in 2015.
On the day before the sentencing, 26 September, the parties presented their cases in court.
The prosecution insisted on three years' community service.
The punishment chosen for me is that I must not visit mass public gatherings and must not communicate with the organizers of the April 7 protest.
"All this time I wore an electronic bracelet and transmitter.
That is how they tracked my location.
I note that I was not restricted in my movements.
Recently I flew from Moscow where I was studying," said Andrei Borovikov.
After the sentence was pronounced the coordinator of Navalny's regional headquarters said that he would serve his sentence in Arkhangelsk.
On 26 September KPRF faction deputy Sergei Shargunov submitted a bill to the State Duma, softening art. 212.1 of the Russian Criminal Code.
KPRF, LDPR and SR representatives told Kommersant of their intentions to support the initiative.
Pavel Mogilevets: "Everybody in Rubin needs to think about the reasons for our unsuccessful games."
Rubin halfback Pavel Mogilevets spoke of the reasons behind the team's unsuccessful games.
The Kazan team suffered four defeats in a row in the Russian championships and dropped out of the Cup.
We are psyched up for every game, Izvestia quoted Mogilevets as saying.
That is why everyone needs to think about the reasons for our unsuccessful games.
There are games ahead of us – we need to prepare for them and fix the situation.
How?
If we knew, we would have probably already fixed it.
But first of all, it seems to me, we need to up such aspects as our one-on-one.
We have problems with this, in my view.
Kremlin supports smoking ban on residential building balconies
The Kremlin supports any measures that save people's lives, said the president's press secretary Dmitry Peskov, commenting on the smoking ban on apartment balconies and loggias.
Earlier the Cabinet approved changes to the Fire Prevention Rules, according to which it is forbidden to use an open flame on balconies and rooms of residential buildings.
Later, the Emergency Situations Ministry said that it includes a ban on smoking on the balconies and loggias of apartments and hotels.
The changes come into force from 1 October 2019.
Infringement will be an administrative offense.
The Kremlin welcomes any decision that helps save human life.
"We know how many fires occur, many of them have extremely tragic consequences and cause a public outcry.
So any life saved justifies such measures," Peskov said.
First and foremost the press secretary approves of it as a fire prevention measure, and not as a way to protect neighbors from tobacco smoke.
Peskov also noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not approve of smoking and is a healthy lifestyle proponent.
Gattuso is seeking work at one of Russia's clubs

China is strongly opposed to the US adoption of Taipei legislation
China is strongly opposed to the US adoption of the so-called Taipei legislation, which seriously violates the one-China principle and the principles of the Chinese-US Three Communiqués.
Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said on Friday.
The US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations' approval of the legislation is also a serious breach of international law, the founding principles of international relations and crude interference in internal Chinese affairs, said Ma Xiaoguang.
According to him, Taiwan is a part of China and issues in connection with this are an internal matter for China.
"We call on the American side to clarify the situation, immediately cease introducing similar negative legislation and immediately cease interfering in the Taiwan issue to avoid further damage to Chinese-US relations as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," he said.
China should and will be reunited.
This historic trajectory cannot be stopped by anyone or any force, said Xiaoguang.
TikTok is hiding undesirable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users exceeds 500 million worldwide, 40 percent of which are younger than 18 years old.
Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok is censoring videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the forbidden Falun Gong religious group, The Guardian reported.
Documents obtained by the publication, reveal that the owners of TikTok (ByteDance company) with the help of their app are promoting Chinese foreign policy goals overseas.
Most of the violations concerning Chinese policy fall under "inciting hatred."
In every case, TikTok classifies the undesirable posts to fall under the scope of general rules so the social network's actions do not appear to be censorship.
For example, a ban on criticizing the Chinese socialist system falls under the general ban of "criticism or attacks on the politics or social rules of any country as well as constitutional monarchies, parliamentary systems and so on ..."
A ban on referring to the events of Tiananmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under "distorting the history of China or other countries."
The document also lists 20 forbidden names of "foreign leaders or politicians" including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The document states that banned materials fall under two categories.
Posts in the first category are deleted by the social network administrators and can lead to the user being blocked.
Less severe violations are included in the second category: such posts remain on the site but their circulation is restricted by the TikTok algorithm.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are out of date and are no longer used: "Now we use a local approach to moderating as well as drawing on independent local specialists."
TikTok has no specific restrictions on posts for Russian users, said Rustem Bogdanov, founder of Producer Center.
Producer Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially works with TikTok.
All the advertising materials from Producer Center's bloggers are agreed with the social network's representatives, but user materials can be posted without approval, said Bogdanov.
When asked about whether users could talk about politics or Putin on TikTok, Bogdanov spoke in the affirmative and said that he had seen such posts.
Roman Zaripov, founder of the Our Digital agency, agreed with Bogdanov: "The main rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: no posting shocking content, discriminatory rhetoric and so on."
However, any content disliked by the moderators can fall under these rules, noted Zaripov.
Zapirov's agency is another of TikTok's Russian partners.
According to TikTok, the number of its users exceeds 500 million worldwide, 40 percent of which are younger than 18 years old.
According to its user agreement, only people over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
The social network's administrators verify ages with the aid of artificial intelligence: a neural network analyses faces and determines how old people appear, said Bogdanov.
If the neural network decides that a user is younger, the user may be deleted, he added.
According to RBK, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the WeWork co-working center.
Istanbul residents spoke of an earthquake in the city
Powerful earthquake caused panic in Turkey's largest city
Last Thursday, 26 September, a 5.9-magnitude earthquake took place in Istanbul.
34 people were injured, ten of whom remain in hospitals.
Istanbul resident Melike admitted she had a panic attack for the first time in her life.
"I cried a lot.
I was weeping right at my workstation.
Later I felt better, I got back to work.
But I am so ashamed now!" the young woman told the "360" TV channel.
"In Istanbul there was a really powerful earthquake.
I still cannot go back!

The Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare released the results of an investigation into the amputation of a child's arm
A Rostov region child had his arm amputated due to an error made by doctors, Vzglad reported, citing the local office of the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare's site.
The 11-year-old boy broke his arm, which was set in plaster at a Zernograd area hospital.
Some point after that, the child developed gangrene and his arm was amputated.
The results of the investigation revealed that errors were made in providing a timely and correct diagnosis as well as in the standard and level of treatment.
The investigation materials were given to the regional Investigative Committee's office of criminal investigations.
Earlier URA.RU reported that the head doctor of the Yuzhnouralsk regional hospital was arrested.
Russians warned over fake phone calls from banks
In Russia there has been an increase in the number of phone calls from swindlers using bank phone numbers.
Kommersant reported this, citing Central Bank information.
In the summer of 2019 the regulator provided telecommunications operators with information about more than 2,500 phone numbers from which clients of various financial organizations were called.
Operators detected 189 cases of number substitution.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases there were restrictions on the use of financial services.
The deputy head of the Central Bank's information security department Artyom Sychev said that a broad spectrum of Russian banks had encountered phone number substitution.
He explained that operators do not always respond to Central Bank warnings about fraudulent calls, referring to the lack of such an obligation in the law "On communication".
The bank Otkritie, Rosbank and Alfa Bank confirmed the information about the increased number of fraudulent phone calls with number substitution.
The Beeline press service said that some of the information about fraudulent phone calls, provided by the Central Bank, was incorrect: the list included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with clients.
Their blocking would cause a breakdown in the organization's work.
Artyom Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudsters' phone numbers, which an operator will refer to in order to check the number of each call.
He explained that the creation of such a database requires legislative amendments.

State Duma to check Voice of America, Meduza and BBC for violations of the law
The State Duma committee for investigating foreign interference in Russia's internal affairs will check some mass media for infringements of Russian legislation.
Interfax reports this citing committee head Vasily Piskarev.
Meduza, MBKh Media, Voice of America, Current Time, Radio Liberty and BBC News Russian fell into the committee's field of view.
Planned checks of the Google and Facebook services were previously reported.
Piskarev also said that he will ask the Foreign Ministry to make a decision about the continued accreditation of Germany's Deutsche Welle, in the publications of which the committee found signs of justification of extremism.
In September Roskomnadzor found political advertising in the Google, Facebook and YouTube services.
According to the department's data, it occurred during the Russian elections of 8 December.
The State Duma committee was told of the violations.
Later Google said the company supports responsible political advertising.
In the opinion of staff, it is obliged to comply with the laws of the country.
The company Facebook noted that compliance with electoral legislation is the responsibility of the advertiser, and not the platform.
The head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov accused the companies of applying double standards in the placement of political advertising.
Stoltenberg discussed Ukraine's accession to NATO with Zelensky
Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership of the alliance at the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The secretary-general spoke of the discussions during his appearance at Columbia University in New York.
Answering a question regarding whether the issue was raised during their meeting, Stoltenberg said that they did actually discuss the question and also stressed that he did not set a time frame for Ukraine's entry.
According to him, any country that wanted to join the North Atlantic alliance had to meet certain requirements dictating concrete standards, RT reported.
Alternative to the NATO path suggested to Zelensky in Crimea
Instead of pursuing NATO accession the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky should work on establishing good neighborly relations with Russia.
The co-chair of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinets spoke about this on Friday, 27 September.
"Sir president of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but heed the advice of [US president] Donald Trump, which he listened to with a sour face, and improve relations with the president of Russia," Chegrinets told RIA Novosti journalists.
Chegrinets noted that he finds Zelensky to be a good actor, but a bad politician.
In his words, the Ukrainian president will be able to remain in power only if relations improve with Russia.
Earlier on 27 September the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that he had a conversation with Zelensky on the subject of the country's accession to the alliance.
In his words, for this Ukraine must fulfill certain conditions.
On 5 June Rada deputy Yevgeny Balitsky said that the possible accession of Ukraine to the alliance does not guarantee improved life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
Barcelona is coercing Neymar
Spanish club Barcelona and its former Brazilian football player Neymar are attempting to resolve a financial dispute, which arose after the striker's move to French club Paris Saint-Germain.
The matter almost reached the courts, but the Catalonians offered the player a resolution without the need for the courts' involvement.
Otherwise, they refused to allow his return.
Neymar and his astute father, who is also the Brazilian's agent, contrived an interesting maneuverer: according to the agreement with Barcelona, which the player signed in 2016, he was due to receive 40 million euros.
However, after literally one year, the forward moved to Paris Saint-Germain for a record 222 million euros.
Nonetheless, he received 22 million from the Catalonians and now wants to claim the remaining 18 million.
Moreover, the Brazilian's lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payments.
When Neymar's demands became known in the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
The club insists that the bonus is dependent on the entire contract being fulfilled – from 2016 to 2022.
As such, the club considers that the player is entitled to only one-quarter of the 40 million euros and demands the return of a portion of the first payment.
But most interestingly, Neymar and Barcelona almost agreed that the "prodigal" player would return to Catalonia's fold in summer.
But the agreement collapsed, however, hope remains that the forward will return.
Citing insiders, Sports.ru reports that the club's lawyers informed the player's representatives that if the financial demands are not settled out of court, then the Brazilian's return can be ruled out.
Neymar himself wants so strongly to return that he has asked for guarantees that the Catalonians will buy him back.
Mart Laar: EKRE members will not join the Bank of Estonia council
Members of EKRE have not been, nor will they be, invited to join the council.
Conclusions are drawn on the credibility of the Estonian state based on the composition of the Bank of Estonia's council.
As long as members of the EKRE continue to speak before they think, none of them will be invited to join the council.
"The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Eesti Pank cannot go and apologize for the statements made by members of the Supervisory Board," Laar said in an interview with Delfi, reported by the ERR information portal.
Laar noted, however, that EKRE is represented at Eesti Pank council meetings.
Beside Laar, the current, seventh composition of the council includes Liina Tonisson, Kaie Kerem, Urmas Varblane, Kalev Kallo, Jaanus Tamkivi (Estonian Reform Party), Enn Listra and Rein Minka.
Laar is proposing to replace two member of the council - Tonisson and Kallo - in their place would be invited Enn Eesmaa (Estonian Centre Party) and Ivari Padar (Social Democratic Party).
Meanwhile, the Estonian Reform Party would like to see Jaanus Tamkivi replaced on the council by Andres Sutt.
In response to this, Laar said that the Estonian Reform Party's goal was to receive two seats on the Bank of Estonia's council - so that Andres Sutt joined the board in addition to Jaanus Tamkivi.
On Tuesday, September 24, Riigikogu declined Laar's proposal to invite new members to the Bank of Estonia's council.
Russian MFA commented on scandal in Kyrgyzstan with Malakhov's show
The Russian MFA commented on the situation with the outrage caused by an episode of Andrei Malakhov's progam "Live," reports RIA Novosti.
Earlier, the Russian diplomat was called to the Kyrgyz MFA after the show aired.
The republic's MFA believes the host made some inappropriate statements regarding the situation with the Kyrgyzstani citizen Islambek Akbarov, who was involved in an accident in which the Russian Alexander Marugov died.
Malakhov said that the Kyrgyzstani citizen could have faked the accident.
The accident occurred on July 8 in Moscow.
Marugov crashed on a motorcyle into the taxi Akbarov was driving.
According to preliminary information, the taxi driver is at fault for the accident.
Malakhov, who Kyrgyzstani citizens demanded an apology from, said his words were simply his personal opinion.
As the Russian Diplomatic Department explained, the Kyrgyz MFA did not summon the Russian diplomats-there was a planned working visit during which they discussed the host's statements, among other issues.
"Andrei Malakhov's point of view is the opinion of a journalist, his personal view of the situation," the MFA said, noting that the incident does not affect Russian-Kyrgyzstani interstate relations.

Alexander Lukashenko intends to use only cosmetics produced in Belarus
Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko intends to use only cosmetics produced in Belarus.

In August, the Belarusian leader advised local sugar processors to find new markets for their products.
Lukashenko encouraged companies not to focus on exporting to Russia and "not to suffer".
The situation with the export of sugar has gotten worse due to the excess of product in the market, recalls RBK.
This relates to Russia as well, where the price of sugar now costs 50 kopecks less per kilogram than in Belarus due to the excess.

The bureaucrat spoke about this in comments to the Telegram channel Podyom.

How to increase your future pension and not overwork
Pension payments can be made by the Russian Pension Fund as well as by non-state pension funds.
NSPFs are private companies, reports Volgogradskaya pravda.ru.
They work like a deposit: you contribute money, the fund invests it and later returns it to you with interest.
If you are interested in this method, first study the information about NSPFs on the Central Bank of Russia website.
All funds operate under the same rules, which are established by federal laws.
Pension points can be purchased according to the law.
A shortfall in points is determined by how many years in the workforce you are lacking for pension eligibility.
This way suits those who worked unofficially.
Also, it is possible to make a contribution for a relative, for example, a homemaker wife.
Recommendations for those who start thinking about the pension at the start of their working life.
Larger pension payments are awarded to civil servants, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who spent a certain number of years working in the Far North.
So that you don't have to refuse yourself anything when you reach pension age, provide for it in advance.
Purchase real estate, currency, securities, save money in deposits.
Most importantly – constantly raise your financial knowledge.
Media representatives visit the fourth reactor of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant
Video recordings taken from the control room of the fourth reactor of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant have emerged on the internet, published first on YouTube by the video news agency Ruptly.
A group of 15 media representatives were reported to have been granted access to the fourth reactor control room of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant as part of a presentation for a guidebook through the exclusion zone.
According to the RT Telegram channel, the journalists wore special protective gear and were there for less than five minutes, since the ruins of the reactor that was destroyed by the explosion still emit 40 thousand times more radiation than normal.
The disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant occurred the night of April 26, 1986.
12 regions of Ukraine and 23% of Belarus were subject to radiation pollution.
19 regions in Russia were affected.
This July, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky signed an order that led to the creation of a green corridor in Chernobyl, which is open to tourists.
The ban on photography in the exclusion zone has also been lifted.
It had been previously reported that the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exclusion zone was open to tourists on the Belorussian side.
The tour organizers pointed out that you could receive less radiation from one day in the zone than during an airplane flight.

Football player Pavel Mamaev, released from prison last week on parole, will not return to the Krasnodar football club.
The club's former midfielder could sign a contract with the Rostov football club in the near future, reports Chempionat.
According to the publication, negotiations between Rostov representatives and Mamaev are now in the final stage.
Presumably, the contract with the 31-year-old will be signed for two years with the possibility of extending it for another season.
Sport-Express writes that a day earlier, Pavel Mamaev was supposed to undergo a medical examination at the Moscow Dinamo, but the check-up didn't happen because of the "uncertain situation in the club".
Krasnodar terminated its contract with Mamaev last week by agreement of both parties.
The midfielder had played for Krasnodar since 2014.
He took bronze with the team twice in the Russian championships.
Mamaev previously played for Torpedo Moscow and CSKA Moscow.

Zenit signed a new contract with Kokorin.
Man with samurai sword tried to fight for cart found in trash pile
A resident of the American town Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after he waved a samurai sword at his opponent in a dispute over a cart found in trash.
54-year-old Curtis Miller was rummaging in a trash pile near an uninhabited house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers who had come out for an evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart in the trash.
Miller saw Beavers' find and got upset.
He considered that he had a right to the cart, since he started rummaging in the trash first.
The men began to argue.
Suddenly Beavers seized the cart and ran away with it in the direction of his home.
Then Miller took a samurai sword that he had found in the same trash pile and began to pursue his opponent.
He caught up with Beavers near his house.
Miller withdrew the sword from its sheath and began to wave it at the cart snatcher.
Beavers told Miller that the scene was being videoed.
After noticing the video camera, Miller ran away, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and went inside.
Soon afterwards he saw an unfamiliar woman enter the yard and take the cart, shouting insults.
Police had already been searching for Miller for driving without a license.
The man was apprehended, and he was charged with attempted murder.
In September it was reported that in the American town Hardyston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked a female stranger and injured her with a sword.
This was how he reacted when guests at a wedding, in the hotel where he was staying, would not let him smoke.
A riot of three
The longer the Moscow Case against participants of summer's protests proceeds, the more noticeably it splinters into separate fragments and loses its political scope.
The evidence confirming the "riots" does not stand up to scrutiny, but in the absence of a political decision to halt the case, a weak body of evidence does not necessarily lead to the accusations being withdrawn.
The collapse of the case should hearten society, but it will certainly leave the security services very exasperated – their efforts to bolster the case with defendants and evidence were in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the case's three remaining defendants accused under Article 212 of the criminal code (rioting) – Alexei Minyailo – was unexpectedly released from custody without any conditions and in several hours’ time was exonerated: the Russian Investigative Committee withdrew the charges against him.
Minyailo had been under arrest for almost two months – several professional communities came to his defense: historians, priests, literary artists.
As a result, only two of those accused of taking part in a riot remain (at first there were 13 defendants): Sergei Fomin, transferred on September 3 to house arrest and Samariddin Radzhabov, who the day before had his arrest extended till the end of December (he is also accused of using force against government authorities, Article 318 of the criminal code).
Court sentences author of joke petition on accession of Latvia to US
The court of the Vidzeme Suburb of Riga has sentenced the author of a joke petition on the accession of Latvia to the United States of America, Denis Bartetsky.
The man was given 80 hours of correctional labor and one year of probation.
"Common sense isn't the strongest side of our system", Bartetsky commmented on the court's decision.
He also added that the punishment is usually less than requested.
The collection of signatures on the accession of Latvia to the US was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, simultaneously with this petition, the site also collected signatures on the accession of Latvia to the "Galactic Empire" and on the country's exit from the solar system and the Milky Way.
A criminal case was initiated against Batetsky article 82, paragraph 1 of the country's criminal code—"A public apeal to undermine the territorial integrity of the Latvian Republic".
Previously, the author of an internet petition on the accession of Latvia to Russia received half a year in prison in 2016.

The document's explanatory memo notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honor and dignity of police officers from "the spread of information of a defamatory nature, including that of a discrediting nature, in information and communication networks, including on the internet".
It is not specified how exactly it intends to protect the police from slander online.
At the same time, the explanation on the document notes that the provisions of the amendments will be applied "by individualizing the mechanism" already provided for by the law on blocking posts offending government officials and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws came into effect in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after the public discussions and an independent anti-corruption review.
According to the explanatory memo, the amendments to the law "On the Police" should come into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law on punishment for "explicit disrespect for the government" on the internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor (the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media) warns the resource about the violation and gives it a day to remove it.
A fine of 30 to 30,000 rubles is stipulated for the first violation, and repeated violations incur administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
Roskomnadzor applied this rule with regard to the media for the first time on April 12, blocking the Yaroslavl outlet 76.ru.
Soon thereafter, the Chudovo regional court of the Novgorod Oblast fined a local resident 30,000 rubles for publishing online "two notes with information in an unseemly form that offend human dignity and public morality and express clear disrespect for society, the state, and the bodies of executive state power in the Russian Federation".

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens prolong youth?
Phytoandrogens have hardly been studied.
The most well-known is pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens have been studied quite thoroughly and demonstrate positive effects on the body.
They lower the risk of certain age-related diseases (including cardiovascular disease and several forms of cancer).
Well known sources of phytoestrogens include all types of beans (the most popular being soy), hops, and flax seed.
However, many professionals believe such dietary supplements can't entirely replace natural hormones.
Don't dismiss the potential danger of such supplements.
For example, taking them can lower the production of natural hormones because too many substitutes enter the body externally.

Veretennikov played for the team in 2004 and 2008.
"I heard how fans organized a movement to revive the Zhenis football club.
And I could not ignore it!
I spent 1 1/2 seasons with the club.
This was not the best time in terms of results or financing, but I will never forget this club and its loyal fans, who always stuck by the team!
I will always remember the Munaitpasov Stadium at which I scored my 200th career goal.
Zhenis should return!
It has a rich history and wonderful fans.
I wish them the very best and believe that the authorities will return their hometown club," wrote Veretennikov on Instagram.

Hydrometcenter of Russia lists examples of folk wisdom that are correct
Russia has a lot of folk sayings that people use to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, they do not all work.
Hydrometcenter of Russia checked all the examples of folk wisdom that supposedly work.
The meteorologists concluded that only two of them can be genuinely trusted and only when it concerns the near future.
Roman Vilfand, scientific director at Hydrometcenter of Russia, said that if the sun is red during sunset, then the next day will really be fair, as our ancestors observed.
And if the heavens shine with a pale light, then the next day will be rainy.
The second functioning piece of wisdom is based on bird observations.
People often say of swallows that if they are flying low that usually means rain.
This can be explained simply - when there is high humidity the gnats' wings become wet and the birds are forced to fly lower in order to catch them, TASS reported.
Different continents have their own folk wisdom.
Groundhog Day is a traditional folk holiday in the US and Canada, where it is marked every February 2.
On this day, the groundhog should be observed as it crawls out of its burrow to determine when spring will arrive.
Mystery oil spill discovered on the beaches of northeastern Brazil
An oil spill of unknown origin has been discovered on 99 beaches in northeast Brazil.
Polluted areas stretch 2,000 kilometers along the shoreline.
Reports of oil spills first began appearing on September 2.
The number of reports, as well as the area affected, has continued to grow with each day through to Thursday.
The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources conducted an analysis of the samples that have been found.
The samples were all revealed to be identical‚ — crude oil.
State-run oil firm Petrobras, which analyzed the samples, announced that their composition did not correspond to oil recovered from deposits on Brazilian territory.
"This is heavy oil.
It could have been released by a ship after its tanks were cleaned.
Many continue to do this.
Most likely it found its way into the ocean currents," Rogério Almeida, coordinator for the oil workers union in the states of Pernambuco and Paraíba, told the Brazilian news portal G1.
He added that despite a ban on the practice, many ships continue to dump waste into the open sea.
Nine sea turtles completely covered in a layer of oil were discovered by environmental workers on beaches in four out of eight states in the northeast of the country.
Only two of them could be saved.
The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources together with Petrobras is set to begin cleaning the polluted beaches in the coming days.
Meanwhile, the institute's specialists recommend that tourists and local residents avoid the oil spills and report any pollution discovered.
Medvedev ordered a review of the regulations for food service enterprises
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev instructed Rospotrebnadzor, the Justice Ministry, the Economics Ministry and the Industry and Trade Ministry together with the business ombudsmen and the entrepreneurial community to revise the sanitary-epidemiological rules and regulations for food service organizations.
Also they must look into the issue of switching to applying the requirements of the Eurasian Economic Union's technical regulations to the organization of food service.
The agencies must present their proposals to the government no later than 15 October, as stated in the list of Mr. Medvedev's orders according to the Dialog program which screened on 11 September on the TV channel Rossiya 24.
By that deadline Mr. Medvedev ordered all the aforementioned agencies, except the Justice Ministry, to present proposals for conducting an experiment in restricting monitoring activities for food service organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad region, starting from 1 January 2020.
The Justice Ministry and Economics Ministry have been ordered to submit a draft law to the government with amendments to the Administrative Code on applying an administrative suspension of activity for food service rule violations that harmed health.
Also, the Labor Ministry, Economics Ministry, Rospotrebnadzor and the Finance Ministry must work on the issue of gradually switching to forming the consumer basket based on a basic set of foodstuffs needed for a balanced diet, starting from 2021.
To recap, the business community raised the issue of outdated regulations after the closure of a cafe in the AnderSon chain.
The business community demanded that the sanitary rules be overturned, and Rospotrebnadzor announced that new ones would be jointly developed.
33 agencies were included in the list
In addition Rospotrebnazor intends to reduce the number of sanitary regulations and rules to a 40th of their current number.

Russians have nothing to save for retirement according to V. Matvienko
Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matvienko believes Russians don't have enough savings for the bill on guaranteed pension product to fully work in the country.
The practice of supplementing pensions through personal savings is quite popular throughout the world.
How timely its introduction is here is another matter.
"In my view, a considerable part of the population has an income now that simply leaves them nothing to set aside for increasing their pensions in the future", stated V. Matvienko.
The Speaker believes that Russians can't understand how pensions are formed and calculated, because "constant changes in this area have completely confused them".
"That doesn't mean I'm against improving the pension system and its regulatory legislation.
"Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to improve pension sizes and citizens' social security.
"But our steps in this direction should be thoughtful and responsible, taking domestic realities into account", V. Matvienko told RIA Novosti.
The head of the Federation Council emphasized that if this initiative (the bill on guaranteed pension product) develops, then several basic principles must be specified, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and state responsibility for ensuring the safety of pension savings.
On September 6, the Russian Ministry of Finance announced the submission of the bill on guaranteed pension product (GPP) for approval.
Its basic elements include the exclusively voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, the guarantee by the state of the safety of citizens' long-term pension savings, the registration of citizens' savings accounts by a central administrator, tax exemptions for businesses, and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man remaining in the Marvel movie universe.
Sony and Disney come to agreement
News of the beloved superhero's departure from the Marvel movie universe angered many loyal fans.
Spider-Man, one of the most famous comic book characters, will remain in the Marvel movie universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures have managed to reach an agreement on the rights to use him in the franchise's films.
This was announced in a Sony press release stating that the third Spider-Man film with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
Earlier it was reported that Spider-Man would leave the Marvel movie universe because Disney and Sony Pictures couldn't come to an agreement on the division of revenue.
Sony owns the rights to the movie hero.
It leased them out for Marvel films, which belong to Disney.
As a result, Sony received revenue from the box office, and Disney collected revenue from souvenirs and toys.
As reported, at some point this situation was no longer suitable for Disney, and the company wanted to reexamine the agreement.
The president of Marvel Studios, Kevin Feige, said that he's excited.
It's amazing that Spidey's journey in the Marvel movie universe will continue.
"All of us at Marvel Studios are very glad to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is an iconic figure.
He's a hero whose story touches every generation and audiences around the world," reads the press release.
At the same time, Feige noted that Sony is creating its own cinematic universe built around Spider-Man.
"He also happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross cinematic universes.
As Sony continues to develop their own Spidey-verse you never know what surprises the future might hold," he said.
Tom Holland, who has played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted a quote from the film Wolf of Wall Street on his Instagram account, where the hero Leonardo DiCaprio shouts, "I'm not leaving!"
Information about the conflict between the companies appeared in August.
As the media reported, Disney wanted to take half of the box office revenue from Spider-Man films, provided that both companies would pay half the cost of producing the pictures.
But this did not suit Sony.
News of the possibility of the beloved superhero leaving the Marvel movie universe angered many loyal fans.
Details of the new conditions have yet to be disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but said: "We have worked well together over the past four years, and our common desire to continue working together was in line with that of many [Spider-Man] fans.
We are glad that we can move forward together."
The film Avengers: Endgame, which united Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk, and other Marvel superheroes, was the highest-grossing in world cinematic history, replacing Avatar.

Congress sees "Russian influence" in Trump's talks with Zelensky
The lower house of the US Congress has accused Russia of involvement in a scandal arising from a telephone conversation between White House head Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
MSNBC News reports that House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that "Russians" may somehow be behind the episode.

Headed by Pelosi, the Democrats, who hold a majority in the house, earlier announced the launch of impeachment proceeding against the president.
This comes after a complaint by an intelligence informer against Trump.
The informer suspected that during a conversation with Zelensky in July, Trump pressured Zelensky to have Ukraine open a case against the son of former Vice President Joseph Biden, who may become Trump's adversary in the elections scheduled for one year's time.
The White House had to provide congress members and the general public with a transcript of the controversial conversation.

The Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing is adamantly opposed to the return of smoking rooms in airports
The Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing is adamantly opposed to the revival of smoking rooms in airports.

An expert told why it's worth giving up teabags
A group of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found out that when a teabag steeps in a cup more than 10 billion microplastic particles are released in five minutes.
Dust particles may also be added to the packaged drink, food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonova told Nation News.
According to the agronomist, a consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of packaged tea – the producer can add ingredients that will not be shown on the packaging.
The dust is not thrown away at the end of the season, so it may end up in the tea.
"Furthermore, teabags don't always contain specifically tea plants," Tikhonova said.
In her words, it is best to reject that drink in favor of tea by weight, which is sold in specialized stores.
Also, she emphasized that in addition to its composition, the danger of packaged tea is also in how it is made – microparticles are heated to high temperatures, causing them to start to release harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea – this drink will have less additives," the expert recommended.

Regions asked to share business support secrets
According to Parlamentskaya Gazeta, on 27 September the Chair of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Andrey Kutepov wrote to the Minister for Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and Finance Minister Anton Siluanov with a proposal to state a position in regard to the federal subjects' initiative for improving legislation in the sphere of support for small and medium-sized entreprises (SMEs).
Time to establish interregional ties
The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy has collated all the information received from the regions about current programs to develop business and legalize the self-employed, as well as the results of such programs.
In their correspondence the regions told the senators about SME development problems and submitted proposals for the improvement of current legislation.
"At present communications between regions is insufficiently developed, as a result of which the entrepreneur community in all regions visited by senators emphasized the issue of the lack of information about regional development programs for entrepreneurship in the country as a whole," stated Andrey Kutepov.
In a supplement to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a summary of positive work by the regions in legalizing self-employment, and combined data from the regions with proposals and problematics (at the editorial office's disposal).
In addition to the relevant ministries, the combined data from the regions was sent to regional government leaders.
The exchange of information about positive initiatives implemented in the regions could stimulate the development of entrepreneurship overall.
The first step towards such an exchange will be sharing the information that the Council of Economic Policy has," the senator told Parlamentskaya Gazeta.
Useful experience
Support programs for small and medium-sized business have been adopted and are successfully functioning in many regions of the country at present.
For example, the Center of Entrepreneurship Support is operating in Vologda region, providing financial support and assisting businesspeople with product certification.
In Ivanov region a business support system has been developed, providing for the implementation of the single-window principle through a multifunctional center.
In Krasnodar Krai, new agricultural consumer cooperatives are offered grants from the krai budget.
A cluster development center is functioning in Oryol region.
As part of the "Acceleration of SMEs" federal project, Amur region is providing for the possibility to subsidize business incubators created on the foundation of non-state co-working centers, with funding from the federal budget.
Special measures to support youth entrepreneurship are being adopted in a number of other regions.
The self-employed are continuing to come out of the shadows
In the opinion of regional governments, a number of changes should be made to current legislation in order to provide more effective support for small and medium-sized business.
For example, Arkhangelsk region proposed changing the term "self-employment" to "entrepreneurial activity", since it "best corresponds to the content of state services promoting self-employment to unemployed citizens".
Ivanovo region considers it necessary to introduce amendments providing for expanding the list of types of activity performed by self-employed citizens, including types of activity in fitting out and renovating residential properties, dacha construction, fitness training.
Bryansk region believes it is important to tighten control over unscrupulous producers of dairy products, using the Mercury veterinary system.
And Kostroma and Magadan regions are advocating for legal and statutory recognition of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and efforts to support social entrepreneurship.
All the proposals from the regions will be considered in the preparation of state programs to support SMEs, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of draft legislation.
"All proposals from the regions will be considered in the preparation of state programs to support SMEs, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of draft legislation," Andrey Kutepov said.
An airline has helped passengers avoid being seated next to crying babies
Air carrier Japan Airlines (JAL) has unveiled a new service: passengers can find out where small children will be seated when booking tickets.
If desired, passengers can now avoid being seated next to them.
Japan Airlines (JAL) passengers now can use the new service to avoid these undesirable seats next to small children.
The air carrier unveiled a service that tracks which spots will seat children.
Passengers will be shown an image of a child's head on seats that are occupied by children aged from eight days to two years when selecting a place in the cabin while booking a ticket.
As a result, people who do not want to fly next to kids because of the possible inconvenience due to their crying can be seated as far away as possible from them.
Internet users who use the airline's services were overjoyed at the new option.
Several of them thanked the air carrier, remarking that other airlines should follow suit.
One user complained that several weeks ago while flying from New York to Doha three crying babies were seated directly next to them.
Another person suggested that "adult-only flights" should be introduced, adding that they would be prepared to pay more for such a flight.
Many tourists noted that they would always try to choose Japan Airlines for their journeys, as they could see no good coming from being seated next to a crying baby in an enclosed space.
Previously, a woman traveling with an infant tried to win over her fellow passengers during a flight from Seoul to San Francisco.
She prepared small bags of sweets with apology notes for every one of the 200 passengers.

Pavel Ustinov joins pickets in support of defendants in "Moscow Case"
Actor Pavel Ustinov joined a series of individual "Freedom For All" pickets held on Friday at the Russian presidential administration building on the Old Square in Moscow, reports an Interfax correspondent.
The series of pickets began on September 18 in support of Ustinov himself and has continued every day since.
The protesters are currently taking turns standing and holding posters with the inscription "Freedom For All" and the last names of those convicted and arrested after uncoordinated rallies in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
Besides Ustinov, the posters had the names of Egor Zhukov, Kirill Zhukov, Daniel Beglets, Evgeny Kovalenko, Konstantine Kotov, Ivan Podkopaev, Aidar Gubaidulin, Alexei Minyailo, Sergei Fomin, Samariddin Radzhabov, Nikita Chirtsov, Edward Malyshevsky, and Vladislav Sinitsa.
On September 16, the Tver Court of Moscow sentenced the 24-year-old Ustinov to 3.5 years in a penal colony on charges of violence against a riot police officer at an uncoordinated rally on August 3 in the center of Moscow (part 2, article 318 of the Russian criminal code).
Then, on September 20, by request of the Prosecutor General, the court changed Ustinov's sentence from detention in custody to recognizance.
The petition for Ustinov's release gathered more than 112 thousand signatures in a day.
Theater and film artists started a flash mob in support of their colleague.
People lined up to participate in the picket as a sign of solidarity with the actor on September 18 on the Old Square.
Human rights activists, journalists, scholars, teachers, doctors, and Orthodox priests demanded that the case be reviewed.
As Ustinov's sister Julia reported to Interfax, her brother does not plan to speak at the meeting in support of the defendants of the "Moscow Case" on September 29 in the capital.
Deliveries of sanctioned foodstuffs to Russia fall to 1 percent of previous levels.
The Russian government has calculated that the deliveries to Russia of agricultural produce and foodstuffs from countries falling under Russia's food embargo have shrunk to 1 percent of their 2013 levels.
According to the report provided to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31,000 tons of foodstuffs were imported from sanctioned countries compared with 3.4422 million tons for the same period in 2013, Interfax reported.
The value of imported foodstuffs fell to $226.5 million from $4.9755 billion, respectively.
This refers to the supply of goods that was not subject to the embargo.
The report showed that the falling volumes of prohibited foodstuffs were compensated for by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia and Serbia.
At the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020, the rule dictating the destruction of agricultural produce, staples and foodstuffs that are forbidden for import into Russia under counter-sanctions.
The document, posted on the official legal information portal, states that the rule was extended for a further year – from December 31, 2019, until December 31, 2020.
At first, the regulation on the destruction of embargoed foodstuffs applied to produce from the US, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein "joined" the list – from January 1, 2016, Ukraine was added.
The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of illegally imported embargoed goods (products that fall under the foodstuffs embargo put in place by Moscow in response to West's anti-Russian sanctions), came into force in 2015.
Furthermore, the government authorized the destruction of sanctioned goods using any legal method.
In response to the West's continued sanctions, Russia also extended its counter measures.
The measures, however, do not extend to foodstuffs that citizens import for their own personal use.
The ban does not apply to goods for personal use weighing under 5 kilograms.
The head of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, earlier referred to the destruction of food products as "simply immoral" and by his account, it negatively influenced peoples' development.
Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing came out in support of efforts to destroy edible foodstuffs.
Following this, the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights issued an equivalent recommendation to the government.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeyev stated that the destruction of food products was incorrect and that thought needed to be put into how to use them once their quality had been established.

Construction of billion-euro telescope begins in Chile
This is reported by TASS citing the European Southern Observatory (ESO) press service.
ESO says that this week construction officially began on the dome of the building that is to house the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope), currently the most expensive and ambitious terrestrial astronomical project.
Its overall cost, according to ESO estimations, exceeds a billion euros.
A large part of this money will be spent making the equipment and constructing the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is the record-setting large mirror, with a diameter of about 39 meters.
It will consist of 798 hexagonal 1.4-meter segments.
This huge mirror, and also two supplementary reflective surfaces 4.2 and 3.75 meters in diameter, will help the E-ELT obtain the first detailed photographs of planets outside the Solar System, stars in other galaxies, and also search for Earth twins.
Researchers will also try to use this observatory to view the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive back hole at the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that construction of the dome has only just begun, scientists, engineers and other specialists have already been developing the mirrors, research instruments and other components of the observatory for three years – from the moment when the first plans to build the E-ELT were announced.
The contract to produce the main mirror, the total cost of which was about 400 million euros, was received by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
